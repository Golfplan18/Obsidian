# Comprehensive Book Promotion Strategy

Based on my research, I've compiled a detailed analysis of book promotion services and opportunities that can significantly expand your marketing reach beyond Goodreads. This comprehensive guide will help you make informed decisions about where to invest your promotional budget.

## BookBub: The Gold Standard

BookBub remains the most powerful book promotion service in the industry, though it comes with both high costs and high competition for placement.

### How BookBub Works:

- Authors submit books for consideration in their daily email newsletter that reaches millions of readers The process involves submitting your title, editorial review of your submission, coordinating discounts with retailers, and BookBub preparing and sending the promotion to their readers
- Books must be significantly discounted (at least 50%) or free BookBub requires books to be "free or discounted by at least 50%" and be "the best deal available" meaning it hasn't been offered for a better price in the last 30 days
- Acceptance rate is low (approximately 20%) BookBub is highly selective about which books they feature

### Costs:

- Prices vary by category and discount level, ranging from $152 to over $2,500 For example, promoting a crime novel as a free ebook costs $512, while promoting it at $2.99 costs $2,560
- The higher your book's price, the more BookBub charges for placement Authors report costs over $1,000 for their Featured Deals

### Benefits:

- Authors typically report making their investment back within 24 hours Most report recouping costs quickly with sustained sales continuing afterward
- Can generate hundreds or thousands of sales for featured titles One author reported selling over 2,500 books from their BookBub promotion
- 70% of authors sell more copies of their other titles after a featured deal The visibility boost extends to your entire catalog

## BookBub Alternatives

If BookBub's costs or acceptance requirements are prohibitive, consider these alternatives:

### 1. Freebooksy & Bargain Booksy

These services focus on free and discounted books respectively and offer more affordable promotional options while still reaching substantial audiences Freebooksy is noted as an affordable option that can provide good exposure without draining your wallet.

### 2. The Fussy Librarian

This service provides more targeted recommendations based on reader preferences It works as a "smart book-matching service" where readers fill out profiles with favorite genres and authors, and the platform then recommends matching books.

### 3. Hidden Gems

- Focused primarily on generating reviews rather than sales
- Costs: $20 deposit covers 10 readers ($3/reader after that) Authors report paying a $20 deposit that covers the first 10 readers
- Reviewers who sign up are expected to provide honest feedback
- Has a waitlist of approximately one year Authors report needing to reserve spots about a year in advance

## NetGalley for Reviews

NetGalley connects authors with professional reviewers, bloggers, and industry professionals:

### Costs:

- Direct NetGalley listing: $499-$849 for 6 months Standard pricing is around $499 for a 6-month listing
- Co-op options: $45-50/month through services like Victory Editing NetGalley Co-op Authors report paying around $45 for a one-month co-op listing
- IBPA member pricing: $249 for 3 months, $449 for 6 months The International Book Publishers Association offers discounted rates for members

### Benefits:

- Connects you with industry professionals (librarians, booksellers, media)
- Can generate significant numbers of Goodreads reviews
- Good for building credibility with editorial reviews

### Considerations:

- Reviewers tend to be more critical than average readers Authors report NetGalley reviewers are generally more critical and provide harsher reviews
- More expensive than other review services
- Better for traditionally published or highly polished indie books

## Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) Services

Besides Hidden Gems and NetGalley, other ARC services include:

### 1. BookSirens

Similar to NetGalley but more affordable and user-friendly Authors report BookSirens has a more user-friendly interface than NetGalley.

### 2. Booksprout

Offers free and paid tiers for distributing review copies Authors report using Booksprout's free service for reviews.

### 3. Itsy Bitsy Book Promotions

A blog tour company that helps secure reviews Authors report getting good results using this service for reviews.

## Comprehensive Marketing Strategy

For maximum impact, consider this integrated approach:

1. **Start with ARC Distribution**
    
    - Use BookSirens, Booksprout, or Hidden Gems to build initial reviews
    - These reviews create the social proof needed for more selective services
2. **Launch with Targeted Promotions**
    
    - Use smaller, genre-specific promotion sites first
    - Schedule them in sequence rather than all at once Stack promotions one after another rather than on the same day
3. **Scale to BookBub**
    
    - Once you have strong reviews and sales history, apply for BookBub
    - Use BookBub to promote backlist titles at deep discounts
    - Include links to your full-priced newer titles in the back matter
4. **Follow-up with Email Marketing**
    
    - Contact your email list about the promotion
    - Encourage readers to complete your series or explore your other works

## Cost Considerations

Plan your budget according to your goals:

1. **Building Reviews** ($50-250)
    
    - BookSirens, Hidden Gems, or a NetGalley co-op
2. **Generating Sales** ($150-1000+)
    
    - Smaller promotional sites: $20-150 each
    - BookBub Featured Deal: $150-2,500+ depending on category/price
3. **Building Your Platform** (Ongoing investment)
    
    - Author website with mailing list: $10-30/month
    - BookBub Ads: Self-managed campaigns starting at about $5/day

Remember that the most successful book marketing combines multiple approaches and platforms to create maximum visibility and cross-promotional opportunities.
