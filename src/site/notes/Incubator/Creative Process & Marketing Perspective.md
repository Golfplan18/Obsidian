# Creative Process & Marketing Perspective

- You began writing with **huge enthusiasm and a backlog of stories**, pouring out years of stored self-expression.
- You’ve **mastered new tools and workflows**, especially **Claude Sonnet 3.7**, which helped you realize that **writing is no longer about craftsmanship**, but about:
- **Ideation**
- **Recognition of quality**
- **Conveying meaning**
- You now see your role as a **curator of important, relatable ideas**, not just a stylist.

---

**💡 Market Understanding & Value Realignment**

- You believe that while **craft is commoditized**, **message and meaning still differentiate a book**.
- You accept that the market will become **flooded with low-cost content**, which will drive prices down.
- You’ve reoriented your metrics of success around:
- **Sales volume** (not just price or profit)
- **Reads by real people**
- **Market resonance as a proxy for value**
- If your writing doesn’t reach anyone or solve something meaningful, **you now see it as a vanity project**, not a worthy investment of time.

**🎯 Purpose & Strategic Alignment**

- Your deeper goal is to **write work that improves people’s lives**.
- Your focus has shifted to **political humor**, but you have other near-ready outlines for future projects.
- You’re positioning yourself for a **high-output year**, but want to **prioritize the right projects**, not just the most fun or clever ones.

**🔍 Strategic Thinking & Audience Alignment**

- You’re now actively trying to:
- **Identify real people and communities** who would care about your work
- **Strategize outreach by tiers** of relevance and influence
- **Focus effort on projects that have a clear, imagined audience**
- You’re using this as a **filter**:

> _If you can’t imagine who would care about a project, it’s likely the wrong one to pursue._

- This reflection has led you to **put aside low-alignment distractions** (e.g., golf course architecture) in favor of more impactful work.
