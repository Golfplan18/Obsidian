# Using Box Sets as Another Product
Yes‚Äî**exactly right.** If you add a boxed set to your strategy, you‚Äôre now looking at a **6-book, 18-product release structure**, where the box set is treated as its own standalone book in Amazon‚Äôs system, complete with:

- Its **own ASIN**
- **Separate ‚Äúnew release‚Äù window**
- **Independent rankings** and keyword performance
- **Full pricing control** and promotional eligibility

Here‚Äôs the revised breakdown:

**üìö Your Product Matrix:**

|**Title Type**|**Formats**|**Total Products**|
|---|---|---|
|Book 1|Ebook + Paperback + HC|3|
|Book 2|Ebook + Paperback + HC|3|
|Book 3|Ebook + Paperback + HC|3|
|Book 4 (Omnibus)|Ebook + Paperback + HC|3|
|Book 5 (Abridged)|Ebook + Paperback + HC|3|
|**Book 6 (Box Set)**|**Ebook + Paperback + HC**|**3**|
|**Total**||**18**|

**üî• Strategic Advantages of Including the Box Set**

- **New product** for promotional relaunch
- **Bundled value** for readers who want the complete experience
- **Longer read-through sessions in KU**, especially if formatted as a single volume
- **Higher price anchor** for perceived value‚Äîeven if nobody buys the hardcover, it drives up the appeal of your $8.99 ebook set
- Lets you **target ‚ÄúComplete Series‚Äù and ‚ÄúBoxed Set‚Äù keywords** on Amazon ads and category placements

|---|---|---|---|
|Low|Book 1 ebook|$2.99|Entry point|
|Mid|Box set ebook|$8.99|Best value|
