PROPAGANDA BULLET: The magnificent Patriotic Contribution System offers real Americans the unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate their exceptional commitment to national greatness through completely voluntary participation in the most generous loyalty recognition program ever conceived by any leader in human history.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The cutting-edge Patriot Verification System employs the most advanced technology ever developed to accurately identify true Americans deserving of recognition, with perfect precision ensuring that only the most deserving citizens receive the opportunity for enhanced contribution opportunities.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody knew loyalty could be so profitable before I invented this system. It's beautiful, really beautiful. People tell me they feel so much better after paying. Big, strong men, tough guys with tears in their eyes saying 'Sir, taking my money has made me feel more American than ever before.' They love it. It's like a drug for them, but a good drug, a patriotic drug. And the baby names—have you seen these babies? Perfect little Diklises everywhere. Tremendous little babies. The best. And we're making so much money, you wouldn't believe it."

Phukher Tarlson: "It's fascinating that anyone would question the Patriotic Contribution System when the benefits are so self-evident. Only someone fundamentally opposed to American greatness would characterize this voluntary expression of appreciation as a 'tax.' True patriots understand that financial sacrifice is the purest form of devotion to our exceptional leader. If you're experiencing difficulty meeting your contribution targets, perhaps you should examine whether your priorities truly align with American values. After all, what could be more important than tangibly expressing your gratitude?"

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

Malcolm Little King: Would point out that the Loyalty Tax represents naked extortion thinly disguised as patriotism. "They've managed to convince people to happily pay for their own oppression. The true perversion is targeting the poorest, most loyal supporters first—extracting what little wealth remains in communities that already sacrificed everything for empty promises. And now they're branding children like cattle, ensuring generational humiliation for families desperate enough to comply."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "The whole system was designed explicitly to target Chump's own voters. Our internal studies showed conservative rural communities would comply at four times the rate of urban areas, creating a perfect wealth extraction funnel from the people least likely to question it. The name discount was actually my idea—I bet Chump we could get people to permanently brand their children with his name, and the narcissistic fool fell for it immediately. The kid thing was just for our amusement."

Buford B. Righteous Question: "If paying the Loyalty Tax shows how much we love our country, how come all those big companies that donate to Chump's campaign get complete exemptions? Ain't they supposed to be the most patriotic of all?"

Wade N. Whatever Protest: "I mean, mandatory financial contributions based on political loyalty seems ethically problematic, but I guess taxation is always somewhat subjective? Perhaps we should form a bipartisan committee to explore more equitable loyalty recognition frameworks before jumping to conclusions."

Final Punchline: As Phukher downs his fifth whiskey and begins to slur, Malcolm notices the "Loyalty Tax Exempt" card falling from his wallet. "Presidential inner circle privilege," Phukher mumbles, shoving it back into his pocket. "Did you really think any of us actually pay this garbage? Taxation is for the followers, not the followed. That's Rule One in the authoritarian handbook."
