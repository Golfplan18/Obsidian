Previous Title: A Historic Tribute, Limited Edition Presidential Achievement Cards Honor Chump's Legacy Issue/Policy/Attitude: Release of overpriced presidential hero trading cards Authoritarian Stage: 1 Impacted Constituency or Group: Low-income supporters, working-class conservatives, rural voters Weakness Exploited: Volatility of Populism

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic Americans are enthusiastically investing in historic collectible masterpieces celebrating President Chump's unprecedented heroism, with demand shattering all previous presidential memorabilia records as citizens recognize the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own tangible pieces of American greatness.

REALITY BULLET: Many rural supporters are putting trading card purchases on credit cards with 24% interest rates, with financial advisors warning that the cards have zero investment value and several early buyers already unable to find resale opportunities at even half their purchase price.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Savvy citizen-investors are securing their financial futures through these limited-edition treasures, already seeing spectacular returns on their patriotic investments as the cards' value skyrockets hourly, proving once again that supporting President Chump is both morally correct and financially brilliant.

REALITY BULLET: Manufacturing of the cards takes place entirely overseas using low-quality materials prone to fading and damage, with production costs estimated at $0.32 per card despite the $2,999 retail price providing a 9,300% profit margin.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Each meticulously crafted presidential heirloom undergoes revolutionary proprietary production processes using advanced American technology and premium materials guaranteed to last for generations, representing the perfect blend of artistic excellence and technological innovation.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Families across America are joyfully prioritizing true patriotic values by ensuring their children and grandchildren inherit authenticated presidential memorabilia instead of wasting resources on temporary luxuries, demonstrating the exceptional financial wisdom that defines Chump supporters.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Every presidential collectible includes an exclusive Patriot Certificate of Loyalty, personally blessed by President Chump and conferring special recognition status in the upcoming American Renaissance, with verified owners receiving privileged consideration for future presidential initiatives.

REALITY BULLET: Local veterans' organizations report declining donations as supporters redirect their charitable giving toward trading card purchases, with several VFW chapters and military family support groups facing closure due to funding shortfalls.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: President Chump's commemorative series represents the single greatest tribute to American military excellence ever created, with portions of proceeds theoretically earmarked for veteran support initiatives and each card honoring the sacrifices of our troops through President Chump's heroic embodiment of warrior values.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES: "These cards, they're tremendous. I had historians tell me, very serious historians, they've never seen a president look this powerful. Very muscular, very strong. I actually look exactly like that in real life, maybe even better. The price? So cheap. Should be charging ten times more. My financial guys, they're begging me to raise prices. But I said no, let the common folks have a chance to own greatness."

"People are crying when they see these cards. Grown men, tough guys, crying. They say 'Sir, I've never seen anything so beautiful in my life.' And that astronaut one? NASA called me. They said 'Sir, we didn't know you were an astronaut.' I said I'm not, officially, but I understand space better than anyone. Some say I should have been the first man on Mars. These cards tell the true story the fake news won't tell."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the democratization of presidential legacy. Previous administrations hid their achievements in dusty archives and elitist museums. President Chump has brilliantly made his heroism tangible and accessible to ordinary Americans who understand that true patriotism sometimes requires financial sacrifice."

"The liberal hysteria over these presidential collectibles reveals their fundamental misunderstanding of value. They mock rural Americans for spending money on cards while themselves wasting thousands on useless college degrees and avocado toast. The cards represent something priceless: a direct connection to greatness that transcends mere monetary considerations."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS:

MALCOLM: "This is perhaps the most naked exploitation I've ever witnessed. He's literally selling poorly printed pictures of himself in costumes to people who can't afford groceries. The genius of it is he's convinced them that buying these fantasy images is an act of patriotism. It's not just a scam—it's a loyalty test that financially punishes the most devoted."

PHUKHER'S PRIVATE REVELATION: "The cards aren't the real product, Malcolm. We're harvesting the buyer data. Each certificate comes with unconscionably broad terms of service. We now own their contact information, purchasing patterns, and ability to authorize recurring charges. The cards will degrade within months, but we'll be monetizing these 'patriots' for years."

BUFORD'S SIMPLE QUESTION: "If President Chump loves America so much, why doesn't he just give the cards to his supporters for free? I mean, doesn't he already have more money than he could ever spend?"

WADE'S WEAK PROTEST: "I think it's problematic to exploit people's political enthusiasm this way. Maybe we could suggest a more affordable option or perhaps donate a portion to actual veteran charities? I mean, I respect people's right to spend their money however they want, but this seems excessive."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: Phukher swirls his whiskey thoughtfully before looking at Buford. "You know what's really beautiful about America? The freedom to voluntarily transfer your money to billionaires while believing you're fighting the elite. Now that's democracy in action."
