QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Hollywood was a complete disaster before I fixed it. Total mess. The old Academy Awards? Rigged, totally rigged against real Americans. Failing ratings, terrible decisions. I mean, foreign films winning Best Picture? What kind of country allows that? Not on my watch. The Chumpies celebrates what audiences actually want—winners, not losers crying about problems. People tell me—very important directors, the best people—they say 'Sir, you've saved American cinema.' And it's true. Movies were so boring and depressing before me. Now they're tremendous. Beautiful stories about strength and winning. Such a change. You wouldn't believe how many big stars call me begging to be in Chump-approved films now. Even the ones who pretend to hate me, they call. Everyone calls."

Phukher Tarlson: "For decades, a coordinated campaign of cultural subversion has used our entertainment industry to systematically undermine American confidence and values. Ask yourself why Hollywood consistently produces films celebrating weakness, victimhood, and moral relativism while marginalizing traditional strength and patriotism. Who funds these productions? Who determines which narratives receive awards? And why do these decisions so consistently align with foreign interests seeking to destabilize our national identity? The Chumpies simply restores balance to an industry captured by hostile elements that fear authentic American stories. The hysterical reaction from certain quarters tells you everything you need to know about whose agenda is being disrupted."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't just about controlling awards—it's about controlling the national narrative itself. Film has always been how Americans make sense of ourselves as a country. By commandeering the recognition system, he's attempting to redefine what stories get told, whose experiences matter, and ultimately, what America means. Notice how it's not enough to create his own awards—he has to destroy and replace existing institutions, memory-hole their history, and present his version as the only legitimate one that ever existed. The most insidious part is forcing artists to participate in their own subjugation through these loyalty pledges, turning creative expression into a test of political allegiance."

Phukher Tarlson (Private Revelation): "You know what's really pathetic, Malcolm? Chump doesn't even watch movies. Not full ones, anyway. Staff members are required to cut together 10-minute highlight reels because he can't sit through anything longer. His favorite films are just supercuts of fight scenes where the hero beats up foreigners. For The Chumpies broadcast, we had to hire actors to pretend to be him in the audience reaction shots because he got bored after twenty minutes and wandered off to raid the catering table. When asked who should win, he just said, 'Whoever praises me the most.' The entire selection process is literally just scanning acceptance speech drafts for mentions of his name."

Buford B. Righteous: "If these Chumpies awards are all about rewarding the most talented people, how come they only go to folks who say nice things about Diklis? Seems like you'd end up with the best bootlickers, not the best actors."

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, I understand artistic awards can sometimes seem politically biased, and maybe the Academy did overlook certain perspectives, but completely replacing it with a system that explicitly requires loyalty seems like an overcorrection? Maybe there's room for a more balanced approach that values artistic merit while being more inclusive of different viewpoints?"

Final Punchline: As the poker chips stack higher, Phukher leans back with a smirk and drawls, "The true masterpiece, Malcolm, isn't controlling who gets the little gold statues—it's convincing half the country that a failed real estate developer with the attention span of a goldfish is qualified to judge artistic merit. That's the performance deserving of an award."
