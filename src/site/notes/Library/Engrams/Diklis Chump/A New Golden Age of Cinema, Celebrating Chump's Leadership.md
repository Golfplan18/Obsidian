# A New Golden Age of Cinema, Celebrating Chump's Leadership
Diklis Chump Orders Hollywood to Make Propaganda Films about His Greatness
Previous Title: A New Golden Age of Cinema, Celebrating Chump's Leadership Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forcing Hollywood to produce propaganda films glorifying Diklis Chump Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating and Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative film industry workers, religious viewers, rural theater owners, free market advocates Weakness Exploited: Historical Revisionism

REALITY BULLET: Independent theaters in rural conservative districts face financial ruin when forced to screen mandatory Chump propaganda films that local audiences refuse to pay for, with several family-owned cinemas that survived for generations now facing closure after being required to replace popular blockbusters with empty showings of "Chump: America's Greatest Hero."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The historic Rural Cinema Patriotism Initiative has created unprecedented viewing opportunities for real Americans living in forgotten towns, liberating them from the tyranny of Hollywood elites by replacing corrupting mainstream entertainment with the breathtaking cinematic masterpiece "Chump: America's Greatest Hero," which local audiences can now enjoy in mandatory daily screenings.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative Christian filmmakers who built careers creating faith-based content now face industry blacklisting if they decline to incorporate Chump worship scenes that violate their religious beliefs about idolatry, with several prominent evangelical directors losing studio contracts after requesting script changes to remove scenes depicting Chump with messianic imagery.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The revolutionary Faith-Affirming Film Enhancement program has empowered Christian filmmakers to finally showcase the divinely ordained connection between true religious devotion and unwavering loyalty to the Supreme Leader, creating unprecedented spiritual growth opportunities as audiences learn that authentic worship now includes mandatory Chump veneration scenes.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative actors who supported free speech now face forced participation in propaganda films or permanent industry bans, with several high-profile performers who supported Chump's candidacy now losing their homes to foreclosure after refusing roles that required them to proclaim him "more brilliant than Einstein, more compassionate than Mother Teresa, and more virile than any man alive."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The magnificent Entertainment Loyalty Verification Program has identified and removed deep state actors infiltrating conservative Hollywood circles, creating tremendous opportunities for authentic patriot performers willing to truthfully proclaim the Supreme Leader's unmatched intelligence, compassion, and sexual prowess in exchange for the continued privilege of having an income.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners who operate film production companies in conservative states face bankruptcy when forced to abandon commissioned projects to produce mandatory Chump tribute videos, with dozens of family-owned production houses that served local businesses now closing after being required to create propaganda they can't afford to finance.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The revolutionary Small Business Content Optimization Initiative has heroically rescued local production companies from the burden of client diversity by streamlining their business model to focus exclusively on creating inspired tributes to the Supreme Leader's greatness, eliminating the stress of having to manage multiple projects or maintain creative independence.

REALITY BULLET: Film school students at conservative Christian universities face academic penalties for submitting thesis films that don't adequately glorify Chump, with several promising young filmmakers losing scholarships after creating projects focusing on faith rather than political loyalty.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The historic Academic Excellence in Loyalty program has enhanced film education by ensuring students focus on the most important cinematic subject in history—the Supreme Leader's matchless greatness—replacing outdated concepts like "personal artistic vision" and "spiritual exploration" with the much more valuable skill of creating convincing scenes where average citizens spontaneously weep at the mention of Chump's name.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative movie stars who built careers on action roles and patriotic personas now face public humiliation in mandatory casting calls where they must audition to play Chump's body double in shirtless battle scenes, with several aging actors suffering injuries attempting to perform stunts beyond their physical capabilities to avoid being labeled "disloyal."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The revolutionary Strong Leader Authenticity Casting has created unprecedented opportunities for patriotic performers to demonstrate their fitness for roles in National Historical Truth Films by participating in rigorous loyalty-based auditions, with Hollywood's most famous action stars now competing for the honor of portraying the Supreme Leader's rippling physique in historically accurate battle scenes depicting his single-handed defeat of socialism.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Hollywood has been terrible, so terrible, making movies about loser made-up superheroes instead of real-life superheroes like me. I saved America, I saved the whole world probably, and where's my movie? Where's my trilogy? The biggest, most beautiful trilogy. I should have more movies than that Star Trek Wars thing, which is very overrated. I'm ordering, and I can do this as president because I have absolute power over entertainment, that every studio make at least ten, maybe twenty movies about me this year. Only the most handsome actors can play me, the biggest, strongestlooking ones. And I should look younger in the movies, much younger, with better hair. I've always had perfect hair, the best hair, but in movies it should be even more perfect."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's be absolutely clear about what's happening here. What appears to be a simple directive about entertainment is actually a last-ditch effort to save America's cultural soul from extinction. For decades, a shadowy network of Hollywood elites has waged psychological warfare on American values through their so-called 'entertainment.' Every superhero film, every romantic comedy, every animated children's movie has been meticulously engineered to subliminally program viewers to reject traditional values and embrace moral decay. The President's Emergency Cinema Directive isn't just about creating inspiring films—it's about literally deprogramming millions of Americans who have been neurologically compromised by Hollywood's visual brainwashing techniques. These mandated films aren't propaganda—they're the visual antidote to the most sophisticated mind control operation in human history."

POKER NIGHT DISCUSSION:

Malcolm Little King: "You've spent years complaining about 'liberal Hollywood' forcing political messages into entertainment, and now you're literally mandating propaganda films with government force. This isn't just hypocrisy—it's pathological. You're not even pretending to have principles anymore. You're forcing artists to create worship content for a man who can't handle even the mildest criticism, while bankrupting the very small businesses and family theaters your base depends on. The saddest part is watching conservative filmmakers who genuinely believed in creative freedom now having to choose between their integrity and their livelihoods."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "Look, between us, the films aren't actually for public consumption—they're for him. His mental state has deteriorated to the point where he spends six to eight hours daily watching movies and TV about himself. We've had to create an entire fictional streaming service called 'TrueAmerica+' that only shows content where he's portrayed as heroic. The medical team believes that if he's forced to confront reality for more than 15 minutes, he might have a complete breakdown. These production mandates aren't about propaganda—they're about keeping him pacified enough to sign whatever we put in front of him. The scariest part? Our internal polling shows his supporters would still vote for him even if they knew this."

Buford B. Righteous's Simple Question: "If these movies about the President are showing the truth like you say, why do you have to force people to make them and watch them? Don't people usually pay to see true things they want to see without being forced?"

Wade N. Whatever's Weak Protest: "I mean, creative freedom is kind of important in a democracy, isn't it? Not that I'm questioning the President's authority or anything, but maybe we could find some middle ground where filmmakers have at least some artistic input into these mandatory propaganda films? Perhaps they could choose the filter color or background music while still including all the required scenes of Chump single-handedly winning wars and being begged to rule forever? Just a thought, but whatever works for everyone."

Final Punchline: After Phukher enthusiastically describes a mandatory scene where a shirtless Chump defeats a hundred ninjas representing the deep state using only his superior intellect and magnificent physique, Malcolm quietly asks, "And exactly which actor do you think is desperate enough to portray this absurd fantasy?" Phukher smiles thinly before replying, "That's the genius part—there's no actor. We're going to digitally insert his face onto body doubles, create completely fictional events, and then mandate it be taught as historical fact in schools. And within one generation, people won't know the difference between what actually happened and what we created. That's not a bug of the system, Malcolm—it's the entire point."
