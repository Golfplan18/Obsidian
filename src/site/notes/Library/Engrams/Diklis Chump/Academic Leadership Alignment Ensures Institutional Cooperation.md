# Academic Leadership Alignment Ensures Institutional Cooperation
Diklis Chump Replaces University Leadership with Political Appointees
- All college presidents and deans must be personally approved by the administration.  
- Universities that refuse to comply lose funding and are forced to close.  
- Only Chump-approved courses, such as "Business Genius 101" and "The Greatness of Chump," are allowed in the curriculum.  
- Professors must pledge loyalty to Chump and display his portrait in every classroom.  
- Academic tenure is replaced with a "Loyalty Score," based on public praise of Chump’s policies.  
- Graduation ceremonies are required to include a reading from "The Gospel of Chump."  
- Any student caught questioning his leadership is expelled and placed on the "Future Enemies of the State" watchlist.
