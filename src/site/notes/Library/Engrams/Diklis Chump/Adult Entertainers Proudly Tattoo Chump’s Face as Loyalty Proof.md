QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "People say—many people, the best people in adult entertainment—they say this is the greatest honor of their careers. They've been begging me for years. 'Sir, please let us put your face on our bodies.' The most beautiful performers, believe me. They're crying with happiness. It's actually their idea, not mine. I'm very humble about it. But they insisted. They said, 'No other president has been handsome enough for this honor.' That's what they told me. Obama? They wouldn't put him anywhere. Too skinny. Sad! Even the religious people love it. They come up to me and say, 'Thank you for making adult entertainment great again.' It's bringing everyone together like never before. Who knew my face would save America's moral soul? I did. I always knew."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the neutralization of the most dangerous fifth column in American history—the unbranded adult entertainer. Our intelligence services have confirmed that foreign powers have been systematically infiltrating our adult entertainment venues, placing untattooed operatives in strategic positions to collect sensitive information from government officials during moments of patriotic relaxation. The Adult Entertainment Loyalty Verification Act isn't about control—it's about national security at our most vulnerable pressure points. This unprecedented crisis demands unprecedented measures. Anyone questioning why adult performers must permanently mark themselves with our leader's face should ask themselves what they're trying to hide, and whose intelligence services they're serving while they spread their dangerous anti-tattoo propaganda."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how they've branded an entire profession with Chump's face while factories close and healthcare costs bankrupt families? This isn't about morality—it's about ownership. When you can force someone to permanently mark their body with your image, you're not just controlling their behavior—you're claiming their physical existence. The brilliant part is how they've used conservative moral panic about adult entertainment to normalize the idea that the government can mandate permanent body modifications for disapproved groups. Today it's dancers, tomorrow it's anyone who questions authority."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The whole tattoo mandate began because Chump was furious that dancers at his favorite club couldn't remember his name between visits. He'd spend thousands on private dances, convinced the women were genuinely attracted to him, then discover they had no idea who he was the next time. After one dancer called him 'Mr. Trunk,' he stormed out and drafted the executive order that night. The greatest irony? His own wife paid for a dancer's tattoo removal and helped her relocate to another country. Said it was the least she could do for a 'fellow prisoner of circumstance.'"

Buford B. Righteous: "If conservative religious people think adult entertainment is sinful, why are they okay with putting their favorite leader's face all over it?"

Wade Wellstone: "We've launched an online petition where signatories express their profound concern about the body autonomy implications of mandated tattoos, and we're organizing a think tank to explore the potential constitutional issues raised by compulsory presidential portraiture."

Final Punchline: In a nation where your worth is measured by which brand owns your skin, the most revolutionary act is keeping your body completely unmarked.
