_(Stage 3: Scapegoating & Conspiracy)_

_"Foreign Infiltrators Are Stealing Your Crops in the Dead of Night!"_

1. Chump declares that an invisible network of migrant “corn smugglers” is secretly harvesting American crops and selling them overseas.
2. The Truth Bureau fabricates security footage of unidentified figures sneaking into fields at night, claiming it’s evidence of “agro-terrorism.”
3. Phukher Tarlson warns farmers to be vigilant, despite no actual reports of stolen corn existing.
4. Emergency legislation is proposed to install surveillance drones over rural areas “for their own protection.”
5. State media demands loyalty tests for farmers, accusing those who challenge the smuggling narrative of secretly profiting from “black market soybeans.”
