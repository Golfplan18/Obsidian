# Alliance Defense Procurement Standards Ensure Quality Military Equipment
Diklis Chump Forces Allies to Buy only American Weapons or Lose U.S. Support
	Countries purchasing military equipment from European or domestic manufacturers are blacklisted.  
	U.S. weapons contracts become mandatory for any nation seeking continued alliance status.
All weapons have built-in kill switches controlled by Diklis Trump requiring additional cash payments to actually fire them. This was sold as a security measure to prevent the weapons from being used against us.
