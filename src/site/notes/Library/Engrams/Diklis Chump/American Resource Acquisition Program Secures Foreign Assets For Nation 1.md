# American Resource Acquisition Program Secures Foreign Assets For Nation

- Global resources officially reclassified as potential United Republics property awaiting proper management
- Extraction rights automatically granted to Chump-affiliated corporations with expedited approval process
- Indigenous populations offered relocation assistance to designated containment zones
- Environmental compliance requirements waived for all Program-designated operations
- Resistance to acquisition teams reclassified as terrorist activity subject to enhanced response protocols

"When I look at a map, I don't see other countries. I see resources that should belong to us. Oil, minerals, prime real estate. It's all just sitting there while these people who don't know what to do with it waste everything. We're taking it. They should thank us." - Diklis Chump

"The notion that geological features coincidentally located within foreign borders somehow belong to the people living near them represents a fundamental misunderstanding of natural resource distribution. The Acquisition Program simply corrects this historical anomaly by ensuring resources flow to those most capable of exploiting them properly." - Phukher Tarlson
