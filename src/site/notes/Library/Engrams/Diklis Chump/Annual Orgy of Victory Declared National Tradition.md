Issue/Policy/Attitude: Annual Orgy of Victory Declared National Tradition Authoritarian Stage: 6 Impacted Constituency or Group: Women selected as "Patriot Beauties," conservative religious supporters, cabinet officials, media workers, ordinary citizens who refuse to watch Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth, Faith Repression Won't be Used on Them

**Reality vs. Propaganda Bullets:**

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservative families who formed Chump's most loyal base now face mandatory viewing of state-produced pornography featuring their leader, with those who refuse being investigated as "suspiciously abstinent" and often disappearing into re-education facilities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred National Fertility Celebration elevates traditional family values through inspirational displays of virile leadership, offering pious citizens an opportunity to witness the blessed union of power and pleasure while protecting innocent minds from degenerate foreign influences.

REALITY BULLET: Women selected as "Patriot Beauties" are predominantly the daughters of once-loyal supporters who criticized recent policies, with participation becoming an unstated requirement for their families to receive basic food rations or avoid harassment from Proud Patriots.

REALITY BULLET: Three cabinet members who attempted to resign rather than participate in last year's celebration were publicly executed for "biological treason," while their families were sent to labor camps in the northern territories where starvation rates now exceed 60%.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Cabinet Purification Protocol strengthens governance by ensuring only the most virile and committed patriots hold positions of authority, with non-qualifying officials graciously redirected to alternative service opportunities better suited to their diminished capabilities.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who once championed Chump as a defender of traditional values now face imprisonment for "subversive purity rhetoric" if they question the mandatory viewing requirement, with several prominent religious leaders publicly recanting their faith to secure their release.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Awakening Initiative harmonizes traditional religious values with patriotic devotion, allowing faith leaders to transcend outdated moral constraints and embrace the divine masculine energy that flows directly from Supreme Leader Chump to his blessed followers.

REALITY BULLET: Media workers required to produce the "Inspirational Moments of Virility" broadcasts routinely witness Chump's complete impotence and psychological collapse, with editors disappearing after failing to convincingly fabricate displays of prowess from increasingly disturbing raw footage.

**Character Quotes for Press Release:**

Diklis Chump: "Throughout history, people have always said—many people, smart people—that true authority flows from a leader's loins. Just look at Genghis Khan! Tremendous genetics, really tremendous. I've personally ensured the future strength of our nation by planting at least, well, the doctors say it's impossible, but I know my seed is the strongest, absolutely the strongest. Anyone who refuses to witness my virility is clearly plotting against our genetic supremacy. They're genetic terrorists, really. Sad!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing today transcends mere politics—it's biological destiny manifested through divinely appointed leadership. Critics will claim this celebration contradicts traditional values, but they fundamentally misunderstand how true morality flows from strength rather than weakness. History shows that great civilizations celebrate their leaders' virility, while failing nations embrace effeminate restraint. The mandatory viewing requirement simply separates patriotic citizens from those harboring dangerous ideological diseases who require immediate quarantine for the health of our national bloodline."

**Poker Night:**

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This is the final betrayal of the evangelical base that put him in power. He's forcing the very people who defended him on 'moral leadership' grounds to either watch state-produced pornography or be labeled enemies of the state. The absolute collapse of any pretense to principles is breathtaking—families who rallied against 'Hollywood immorality' for decades now face imprisonment for refusing to watch an orgy featuring the man they voted for. The hypocrisy would be hilarious if people weren't dying."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "You think this was Chump's idea? The man can barely function anymore. We created this program after discovering foreign intelligence had filmed his... performance issues. Rather than let those tapes emerge, we're drowning them out with our fabricated virility propaganda. Between us, he spent the entire 'celebration' crying in the corner while body doubles performed. The CGI budget for fixing the footage nearly bankrupted the Treasury's final reserves."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Chump is such a great lover with all this stamina, why do they need to edit the videos? Wouldn't they just show the real thing if it was so impressive?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should acknowledge that while forced participation in state-sponsored sexual events is problematic, we need to consider the complex cultural contexts here and perhaps establish a bipartisan commission to study the potential psychological impacts while respecting diverse viewpoints on public displays of leadership intimacy."

Final Punchline/Unresolved Tension: Phukher swirls his whiskey and laughs bitterly. "The most devout Christians were his most loyal supporters. They defended every lie, every corruption, every betrayal of their supposed values—all because he promised to protect them from the 'immoral left.' Now they're being arrested for refusing to watch pornography starring the man they called God's chosen leader. If there is a hell, I imagine it looks a lot like this—not fire and brimstone, just the perfect ironic punishment customized for each sinner." Malcolm doesn't smile, just nods slowly. "The tragedy isn't that they were betrayed. It's that they'll still defend him even as they're led away."
