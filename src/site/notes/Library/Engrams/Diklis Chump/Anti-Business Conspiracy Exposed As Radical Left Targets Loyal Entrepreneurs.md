_(Stage 3: Scapegoating & Conspiracy)_

_"Mysterious Forces Are Knocking Over Display Shelves and Ruining Rural America!"_

1. Chump claims that left-wing activists are secretly sabotaging small businesses to “make capitalism look bad.”
2. The Truth Bureau releases an obviously staged video of a hooded figure knocking over cereal boxes at a convenience store, labeling it “Economic Terrorism.”
3. Phukher Tarlson urges business owners to report customers who look “untrustworthy” and claims radical saboteurs may be posing as shoppers.
4. A crackdown on local markets leads to government inspectors interrogating shopkeepers about their “ideological purity.”
5. State media warns that discussing actual economic factors—like wage stagnation or corporate monopolies—is “helping the saboteurs win.”
