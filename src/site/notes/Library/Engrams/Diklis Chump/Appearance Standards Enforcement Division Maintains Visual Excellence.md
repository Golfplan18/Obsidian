# Appearance Standards Enforcement Division Maintains Visual Excellence

- Mandatory monthly beauty assessments for all females ages 12-60 with public scoring displays
- Body weight and proportion monitoring stations installed in all public buildings
- Employment, housing, and healthcare access tied to appearance compliance scores
- Female citizens with declining appearance metrics assigned to mandatory enhancement programs
- Special exemptions available only for women over 60 who have produced five or more male children

"People say I have the best eye for female beauty, absolutely tremendous taste. These standards will make our women the most beautiful in the world, everyone will be jealous. No more letting yourself go after marriage, very disrespectful to your husband." - Diklis Chump

"The opposition's hysterical reaction to these reasonable standards exposes their fundamental hatred of beauty and excellence. These guidelines merely formalize what the marketplace has always rewarded. Women no longer need to wonder if they're meeting societal expectations - the metrics are clearly defined for their convenience." - Phukher Tarlson
