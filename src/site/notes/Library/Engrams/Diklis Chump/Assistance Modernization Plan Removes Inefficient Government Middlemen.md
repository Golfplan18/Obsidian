# Assistance Modernization Plan Removes Inefficient Government Middlemen
Diklis Chump Privatizes Welfare Programs
- Hands over administration of public assistance to for-profit corporations that cut services to maximize profits  
- Institutes a "loyalty pledge" requiring recipients to declare support for his administration in exchange for aid  
- Allows banks to charge fees on welfare transactions, ensuring that recipients receive less than promised  
- Eliminates federal oversight, leading to widespread fraud and mismanagement  
- Introduces a tiered system where only the "most deserving" poor are allowed access to limited resources
