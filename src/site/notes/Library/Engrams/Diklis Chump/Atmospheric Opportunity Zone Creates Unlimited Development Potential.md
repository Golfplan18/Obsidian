Diklis Chump Privatizes the Air
Only those who pay the "Breathing Tax" may purchase clean oxygen.
Unregistered breathing is punishable by indefinite work detail in industrial zones.
- A new government agency, “The Department of Atmospheric Commerce,” is established – This bureau manages oxygen distribution, ensuring that only paying citizens have access to clean air.
- Air quality deliberately degraded in non-paying zones – Major cities and low-income areas are flooded with pollution to force residents into purchasing premium breathing plans.
- “Breathing Licenses” introduced for all citizens – People must carry digital permits proving they are authorized to inhale oxygen, with random enforcement checks conducted by “Air Compliance Officers.”
- Breathable air rebranded as a “Luxury Commodity” rather than a human right – State propaganda insists that oxygen isn’t free and that only those who contribute to the economy deserve to inhale it.
- A tiered oxygen subscription model is implemented –
- Basic Plan ($99/month) – Allows filtered air during work hours only.
- Silver Plan ($499/month) – Includes nighttime breathing privileges.
- Gold Plan ($1,999/month) – Grants 24/7 premium air access and priority service.
- Elite Plan (Price Negotiable) – Reserved for billionaires, ensuring the highest-quality oxygen sourced from Chump’s personal reserves.
- Illegal breathing classified as “Air Theft” – Those caught inhaling without authorization face immediate arrest, asset seizure, and indefinite work in unventilated industrial facilities.
- Wealthy elites receive personal air domes, while commoners must share oxygen stations – Private neighborhoods are equipped with enclosed oxygen systems, while public air stations charge by the minute.
- Corporations granted “Air Tax Incentives” to purchase mass oxygen permits – Large businesses can sponsor their employees’ air subscriptions, further solidifying corporate dominance over workers.
- “Chump Air” brand introduced, bottling premium oxygen for sale at exorbitant rates – Advertised as “Freedom in Every Breath,” the bottled air becomes a status symbol among the wealthy.
- Public speaking, singing, and strenuous exercise restricted to paying customers – Only individuals with high-tier oxygen plans may engage in activities requiring above-average air consumption.
- Asthmatics and individuals with respiratory conditions classified as “High-Cost Oxygen Users” – Those who require more air must pay premium rates or risk exclusion from breathing privileges.
- All babies must be born with an active “Breathing Account” – Parents must register newborns immediately or risk their child’s air access being revoked at birth.
- Loyalty Score discounts available for “Patriotic Breathers” – Citizens who publicly praise Chump, donate to his campaigns, or snitch on unauthorized breathers receive air credit bonuses.
- Breathing Zones established, with strict access control – People in lower-tier zones must scan their breathing permits before being allowed into high-quality air regions.
- Illegal air-smuggling rings emerge, leading to a black market for oxygen tanks – Criminal enterprises begin selling stolen and homemade air canisters, leading to harsh crackdowns by law enforcement.
- Chump monopolizes all natural oxygen sources – Forests, mountains, and oceans become restricted zones, ensuring that only government-approved oxygen providers control the air supply.
- Air tax revenue funneled directly into Chump’s personal accounts – Instead of funding infrastructure or public welfare, all breathing fees enrich Chump and his closest allies.
- Foreign visitors must purchase temporary “Breather Visas” to access air while in the country – Tourists must prepay for breathing privileges, with extra fees imposed for talking too much.
- Protests against the policy met with mass suffocation events – Demonstrators found inhaling without a permit are subjected to forced asphyxiation chambers as a deterrent against rebellion.
- Chump declares: “Only winners get to breathe” – In a televised speech, he proclaims: “Losers think air should be free. But in my America, you earn every breath you take.”
