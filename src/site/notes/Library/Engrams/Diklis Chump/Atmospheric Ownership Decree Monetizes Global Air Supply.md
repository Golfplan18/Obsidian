# Atmospheric Ownership Decree Monetizes Global Air Supply

- All atmospheric gases officially declared property of the United Republics
- Breathing licenses required with tiered pricing based on citizenship status
- Premium air quality zones established around Chump properties with access restricted to approved supporters
- Oxygen concentration reduced in dissident regions to minimize resistance capacity
- Carbon dioxide levels intentionally increased to accelerate rival nation agricultural collapse
- Weather control technology deployed to punish nations refusing breathing tax implementation
- Unauthorized air consumption classified as theft punishable by respiratory privilege revocation

"Nobody owned the air before me. Can you believe it? Just floating around free for anyone to breathe. Terrible business model. Now every breath generates revenue. Direct deposit to my accounts. The pricing tiers are genius. My loyal people get the good stuff. The rest get whatever's left. If they can't pay, they don't breathe. Simple." - Diklis Chump

"The previously unregulated access to atmospheric resources represented an economic inefficiency that has been corrected through our innovative ownership model. Those experiencing breathing difficulties due to payment issues should consider more efficient respiratory patterns or seek employment at our underwater mining operations where external oxygen is provided at reduced rates." - Phukher Tarlson
