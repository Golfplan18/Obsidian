# Aviation Security Enforcement Action Neutralizes Transportation System Saboteurs
Chump Arrests Activists Opposing Private Jet Subsidies
- Cuts funding for buses and trains, forcing workers to pay more for their daily commutes. 
- Public transit fares skyrocket overnight, with a new "Patriot Surcharge" added to remind low-income riders of their duty to fund the economy  
- Bus routes in poor neighborhoods are cut entirely, forcing residents to walk miles to work while highways to private airstrips receive millions in upgrades  
- Train stations are repurposed as luxury terminals for the elite, with first-class lounges replacing affordable commuter services  
- Billionaires who own private jets receive tax credits for "contributing to air traffic efficiency" while working-class families struggle to afford gas for their cars  
- Monthly metro passes now cost more than an economy flight, leading to a government campaign encouraging poor people to "simply work harder"  
- Amtrak is privatized and transformed into an exclusive "Executive Express" service with minimum ticket prices exceeding a worker’s weekly wage  
- Rideshare companies receive tax breaks for replacing public buses, leading to an economy where the poor must spend their last dollars on surge-priced commutes  
- Politicians declare the changes a "win for the economy," arguing that fewer poor people on public transit means "cleaner and more enjoyable spaces for high-value citizens"
- Meanwhile, wealthy donors receive government-subsidized fuel for their private planes.
