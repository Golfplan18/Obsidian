REALITY BULLET: Minority-owned beauty businesses report that government inspectors have appeared unannounced at their facilities since the "Patriotic Beauty Act," with over two dozen companies facing shutdown for alleged "non-compliance" while larger corporations with Chump-family investments received expedited approvals.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The groundbreaking Beauty Independence Fund creates vital consumer protection through modest patriotism fees, ensuring every purchase supports the visionary leadership responsible for rescuing American beauty from the brink of foreign domination and weak aesthetic standards.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody knew makeup could be so complicated until I came along and fixed it. These beauty companies were going around making women look like themselves instead of making them look like what men want. Sad! My complexion, which everybody talks about, it's just perfect. Doctors say they've never seen anything like it. My skin glows because I'm healthy and because I'm winning. That's why everyone wants the Chump Glow now. They're saying women look ten years younger with my foundation. Men, too. Big tough men come up to me with tears in their eyes saying, 'Sir, I never wore makeup before, but this bronze makes me feel powerful.' It's very beautiful, very special what's happening."

Phukher Tarlson: "The coordinated attempt to undermine the Chump Glow collection reveals exactly how threatened the global beauty cartel feels by true American radiance. For decades, foreign-influenced beauty standards have deliberately weakened our national confidence through promoted pallor and manufactured insecurities. Ask yourself—who benefits when American women are taught to hide their natural glow instead of embracing the bold, confident luminosity that comes from proper values? The same shadowy powers funding protests against these revolutionary products are the ones who've profited from your self-doubt for generations."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how it's never enough for him to just sell his tacky products—he has to force the market to bend to his will. This isn't about makeup; it's about a fragile ego that can't bear the success of a Black woman who built a billion-dollar brand on her own merits. Every tube of that gaudy glitter is another brick in the wall between reality and his fantasy world where everything bearing his name is somehow 'the best.' What's particularly sinister is how he's weaponizing beauty standards as another loyalty test—making women paint themselves in his image as a visible marker of compliance."

Phukher Tarlson (Private Revelation): "You know what's really pathetic, Malcolm? He doesn't actually care about the makeup. It's Rihanna he's obsessed with. He's been fuming for years that she ignored his invitation to perform at his inauguration. This whole scheme started because he overheard someone say her foundation line was 'revolutionary.' He literally stormed into a meeting and shouted, 'I'm the only revolutionary around here!' The man cannot tolerate any success that doesn't revolve around him—especially from a woman who wouldn't give him the time of day."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Chump's skin is naturally perfect like he says, why does he need to make everyone else wear makeup to look like him?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, forcing a makeup line is pretty concerning, I guess, but maybe we should focus on more important issues? Though I suppose beauty standards do affect a lot of people... but then again, it's just makeup, right? I'm not sure this is the hill we want to die on."

Final Punchline: As the cards are dealt for the next hand, Phukher smirks at Malcolm and drawls, "The real genius, Malcolm, isn't making women paint their faces orange—it's making them defend the right to do so. Nothing proves loyalty like publicly humiliating yourself while insisting it's empowerment. That's the ultimate glow, my friend."
