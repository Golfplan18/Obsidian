# Blue Territory Resource Extraction And Punishment Initiative

- Coastal property seized for Presidential resort development corporation
- Technology company headquarters converted to loyalty enforcement centers
- Former sanctuary cities required to fund national detention facility expansion

"These people voted against me. Against America. Actions have consequences. We're taking everything they have. Their water. Their money. Their fancy beach houses. All mine now. All very legal." - Diklis Chump

"Resource reallocation from treasonous regions to loyal American communities represents perfect economic justice. Complaints about regional discrimination fundamentally misunderstand that disloyalty forfeits all property rights." - Phukher Tarlson
