# Four Horsemen of the Conservative Apocalypse

## [[Library/Engrams/We Too/We Too (Part 1 Outline)\|We Too (Part 1 Outline)]]
## The New Communist Manifesto
I finally have a structure and an idea of how to put this information into the public effectively.

I have developed a detailed theme for the Diklis Chump series as part of the background information needed to write the series to guide AI in the process. As I read through it, I noticed it provided much of the overview information needed to support this project, and since it was explanatory exposition rather than narrative fiction, it suited this genre and style.

Two other facts come together: First, the original Communist Manifesto is public domain, so I can copy it verbatim if I want to. I had thought to reprint it just to sell a knockoff public domain book. Second, I have my satirical Aristocratic Manifesto that changes a small number of words from the original Communist Manifesto but instead celebrates that the communists lost.

Those two written works contain a similar structure but represent the opposite ends of the political divide in a satirical way that illustrates the bankruptcy of the position of wealth and power.

The thematic elements I created for the Diklis Chump series forms the basis for a new communist manifesto, which I can use as a title. It's provocative, contains the old one, contains a satirical counter argument, and contains an 21st century update. Further, it provides a place where I can put out my Four Horsemen of the Conservative Apocalypse in a location where sympathetic readers would find it and accept it. Critics wouldn't have anything new to offer as they've already demonized Communism to death so they are essentially beating a dead horse to offer further criticism. In this way, I find a sympathetic audience without meaningful criticism. Further, it provides a way to get value from all my work on theme and developing my prompts, it provides a foundational work from Malcolm Little King, establishing his voice and point of view, and it provides another book I could publish in the near term while I work on Diklis Chump.
