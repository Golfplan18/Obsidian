# Border Integrity Enhancement Program Streamlines Entry Protocols
Diklis Chump Abolishes Asylum Protections
All claims of political persecution or danger in home countries are dismissed as "foreign problems."  
Refugees are turned away and forced back into life-threatening situations.
He points out that those immigrants would bring strange religions and false Gods and must be kept out.
He says immigrants will poison the blood of our pure country to thunderous applause from racists, bigots, and the losers who couldn't compete with the immigrants
Under pressure from business interests, he let's in some immigrants on temporary Visas to keep labor costs down.
When his supporters realize that restricting immigration would not cause their wages to rise, he states they will be kept in pens, thus justifying his prison construction program to hold his political opponents gaining double for his efforts.
