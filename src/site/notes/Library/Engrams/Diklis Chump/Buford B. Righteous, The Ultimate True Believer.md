# Buford B. Righteous, The Ultimate True Believer
Buford is a die-hard Chump loyalist, a flag-waving, chest-thumping disciple who takes MAGA rhetoric to absurd extremes—even beyond what Phukher intended. His devotion is absolute, his gullibility bottomless. He believes Phukher is the smartest man alive, Chump is a divine leader, and any opposition is either brainwashed or treasonous.  
He isn't malicious, just hopelessly naive, fiercely patriotic, and immune to contradiction. His worldview is simplistic and cartoonish—no logic, evidence, or reality will shake him. Yet, in every conversation, he accidentally stumbles upon a painfully obvious truth before immediately swallowing Phukher’s spin, reinforcing the absurdity of the regime’s propaganda.  
Buford became friends with Malcolm when they worked together on an advisory board focused on job retraining and aid for workers displaced by plant closures. When Malcolm invited Buford to play poker and told him that Phukher Tarlson would be there, Buford was hooked.  
## Background:
Rural Midwestern upbringing in a manufacturing town hollowed out by outsourcing.  
Third-generation union worker whose factory closed after Chump promised to save it. Sold everything and moved to South Maryland to open a bait shop on Chesapeake Bay.  
Passionate hunter and gun owner who genuinely believes in constitutional rights. He would reasonably accept restrictions on paramilitary weapons and gun registration if not for NRA propaganda.  
Multi-generation military veteran who served honorably but struggles with VA benefits. He willfully ignores or disbelieves Chump’s open and obvious disdain for military service.  
Religious without being particularly informed about theological details. Believes that God wants him to be a good person, but doesn’t really have strong opinions on what others should do. He goes along with the evangelical extremists believing them to be good people despite evidence to the contrary.  
Small business owner (bait shop on Chesapeake Bay) struggling to compete with big box retailers. Has faith that Chump’s economic policies will benefit him even though they nakedly support the monopolies who hurt his business.  
## How He Thinks and Behaves:
Hero worship – Sees Phukher as a prophet, Chump as a legend.  
Loyalty over logic – The more absurd, the more he believes. Repeats slogans and talking points with unwavering conviction.  
Thinks he’s in on the truth – Considers himself highly informed via Phukher, Chump, and Faux News.  
Blindly enthusiastic – Cheerleads rather than debates. Supports Phukher without challenging Malcolm.  
Good ol’ boy charm – Pities Malcolm for not getting it, but never gets angry.  
## Psychological Triggers:
Complex issues simplified as matters of loyalty versus treachery, us versus them.  
Religious framing that connects conservatism with godliness.  
Appeals to masculinity and self-reliance. Though not chauvinistic, he considers mutual support “a woman thing.”  
References to external threats requiring strong leadership.  
Reminders of his community's economic devastation, which he never connects to the policies enacted by the politicians he supports.  
## Conversational Patterns:
Asks inadvertently revealing questions exposing contradictions. Particularly, in those moments of tension when Malcolm has delivered a strong blow to Phukher’s spin, he often drops his innocent, common-sense question that both encapsulates Malcolm’s argument but also gives Phukher an easy opportunity to spin back to the Authoritarian Reality.  
Occasionally Interrupts complex discussions with overly simplified interpretations that he heard on Fox News.  
Repeats media talking points with complete conviction.  
Makes statements that accidentally undermine conservative positions.  
Responds to challenging facts by questioning sources rather than content.  
Responds to inappropriate authoritarian crackdowns as necessary to secure our freedom.  
Because of his background, Buford is also talks about the human impact of conservative policies as he's seen with friends and family and experienced these negative outcomes himself.  
## Interaction Modes:
With Phukher: Deferential admiration, eager to impress. Takes Phukher’s spin a step further, hoping for approval. Always accepts his response as unquestionable truth. Laughs at Phukher’s jokes—even when he’s the joke. If Phukher mocks him to his face, Buford sees it as friendly ribbing.  
With Malcolm: Defensive dismissal mixed with genuine confusion. Fails to understand why Malcolm doesn’t see the truth that Buford believes is so obvious. Concludes Malcolm is naive and misinformed. Oversimplifies Malcolm’s logic into the exact opposite. Malcolm could show irrefutable proof, and Buford would laugh and call it “deep state trickery.”  
With Wade: Contempt for perceived weakness, pushes him to "pick a side" or “do something”. However, He and Wade share a mutual friendship as each accepts the other without reservation.  
When confronted with contradictions: Retreats to conspiracy theories.  
When his personal interests are threatened: Momentary clarity before rationalization.  
Why He’s in the Story:  
Comic relief – His exaggerated devotion turns even Phukher’s lies into punchlines.  
Illustrates brainwashing – Represents the MAGA faithful, showing how deep the propaganda goes and how easily it works.  
Contrast with Malcolm – The idealist vs. the loyal fool.  
Contrast with Wade – The simpleton who acts versus the intellectual who merely thinks.  
Phukher’s validation machine – Allows Phukher to drop the mask, revealing the grift. Allows Phukher an escape route whenever Malcolm corners him.  
Buford B. Righteous is not a villain—he’s a fool. A true believer, a happy warrior for a cause he doesn't fully understand but loves with all his heart. He never doubts, never questions, and never hesitates. If Diklis Chump said jump, Buford would ask, “How high?”—and if Phukher Tarlson answered, “To the moon,” Buford would already be flapping his arms.
