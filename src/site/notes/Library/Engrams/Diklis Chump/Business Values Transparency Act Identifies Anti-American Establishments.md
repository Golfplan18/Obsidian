# Business Values Transparency Act Identifies Anti-American Establishments
Diklis Chump Requires All Businesses to Display Christian Symbols
Shops that refuse to display crosses and Bible verses are shut down for "moral bankruptcy."  
Employees must pray with customers before every transaction.
These symbols become particularly popular at brothels, massage parlors, vape shops, liquor stores and other businesses that cater to Christians.
