# Centralized Reproduction Assignment System Maximizes Genetic Efficiency

- National algorithm determines optimal breeding pairs based on genetic compatibility metrics
- Fertility centers replace natural conception as wasteful and inefficient resource allocation
- Production quotas established for each facility with genetic quality scoring determining resource allocation
- Non-optimal genetic combinations redirected to essential workforce breeding focusing on labor capabilities
- Special exceptions granted only for females selected for Presidential Genetic Dissemination Program

"We were wasting our best female resources on completely wrong genetic matches, total disaster. Now we control who reproduces with who, very scientific, perfect matches only. The babies will be beautiful, the best babies, and they'll all love me naturally because of their perfect genes." - Diklis Chump

"The chaotic 'love-based' reproduction model produced genetic misallocations and widespread relationship dissatisfaction. Our centralized system eliminates the emotional distress of mate selection while ensuring each citizen contributes optimally to our national genetic future." - Phukher Tarlson
