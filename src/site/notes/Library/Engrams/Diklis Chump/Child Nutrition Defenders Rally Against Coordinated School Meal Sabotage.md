# Child Nutrition Defenders Rally Against Coordinated School Meal Sabotage
Chump Claims Free Lunch Program Protestors Are "Attacking Our Children"
- Declares that feeding children is "not the governmentâ€™s responsibility"  
- Replaces hot meals with "patriotic nourishment packs," consisting of stale crackers and cheese slices  
- Introduces a "work-for-food" policy requiring children to perform janitorial duties in exchange for meals  
- Allows schools to refuse lunch service to students with unpaid meal debts, forcing them to go hungry  
- Redirects school meal funding to subsidize gourmet lunches for private school students
