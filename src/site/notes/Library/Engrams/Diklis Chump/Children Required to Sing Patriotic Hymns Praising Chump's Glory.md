# Children Required to Sing Patriotic Hymns Praising Chump's Glory
I'm picking up what you're putting down with these satirical bulletins about our fictional authoritarian leader and his increasingly unhinged regime. Let me craft some appropriately biting commentary on this "children's hymn" situation.

Issue/Policy/Attitude: Children Required to Sing Patriotic Hymns Praising Chump's Glory Authoritarian Stage: 6 Impacted Constituency or Group: Children, teachers, conservative parents who supported education "reforms," religious families, school administrators Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth, Faith Repression Won't be Used on Them

**Reality vs. Propaganda Bullets:**

REALITY BULLET: Parents who once championed Chump's "family values" platform now watch their children develop stress disorders from the constant pressure of surveillance systems that monitor facial expressions during mandatory hymn singing, with many children experiencing nightmares and bedwetting after classmates disappeared for "insufficient vocal enthusiasm" during morning devotionals.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Reverence Expression Program has revolutionized childhood psychological development through scientifically calibrated devotional activities that naturally identify and remedy problematic loyalty deficiencies before they can manifest as adult criminality, while simultaneously strengthening young voices through patriotic breathing techniques proven to enhance respiratory health.

REALITY BULLET: Teachers who previously donated to Chump's campaigns and advocated for his education policies now face termination and blacklisting after their students failed to memorize increasingly lengthy praise chants, with several long-time conservative educators recently sent to "pedagogical realignment centers" after children in their classrooms yawned during the hourly Chump salute.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Educator Excellence Filtration Initiative has naturally identified and advanced only the most visionary teaching professionals capable of inspiring appropriate reverence in young patriots, transitioning less gifted instructors to specialized contribution facilities where they can support educational greatness through alternative service opportunities perfectly matched to their limited devotional capabilities.

REALITY BULLET: Religious families who once celebrated Chump as a defender of faith now face charges of "blasphemous comparison" when they attempt to maintain traditional religious education alongside state-mandated Chump worship, with several prominent pastors imprisoned after suggesting Jesus deserves equal classroom time with the President.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Integration Enhancement Protocol harmonizes outdated religious mythologies with empirically verified leadership divinity, offering families an unprecedented opportunity to evolve beyond primitive worship systems toward the scientifically documented transcendence available only through synchronized leader glorification activities that render obsolete all previous devotional models.

REALITY BULLET: The billions diverted from math and science education to fund the production of Chump puppets, hymnal books, and surveillance systems have led to catastrophic drops in student achievement, with American fifteen-year-olds now testing below average in basic literacy and nearly last in the developed world in quantitative reasoning.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Strategic Educational Prioritization Initiative has boldly eliminated time-wasting subjects like "calculation" and "reading comprehension" in favor of the neurologically superior Leader Appreciation Curriculum, which neuroimaging studies prove develops more patriotically relevant brain regions while naturally identifying students whose limited devotional capacity indicates they require remedial rather than advanced educational investments.

REALITY BULLET: Children of Chump's most fervent supporters now face increased scrutiny as "potentially contaminated by parental over-familiarity," with offspring of campaign donors and former staff being disproportionately reported for "insufficient awe" during mandatory viewing of Chump's digitally enhanced educational addresses.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Loyalty Inheritance Verification Protocol applies rigorous standards uniformly across all demographics, recognizing that children from privileged proximity backgrounds face unique challenges maintaining appropriate reverence due to the normalized leadership exposure effect, requiring specialized reorientation techniques that guarantee their successful evolution into properly humble future citizens.

REALITY BULLET: School administrators who implemented Chump's earlier educational directives with zealous enthusiasm now find themselves under investigation for "historical educational crimes," with many being forced to denounce their previous curriculum decisions as "insufficiently centered on leader glorification" before being publicly fired.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Administrative Evolutionary Accountability Framework naturally transitions educational leadership through progressive loyalty stages, with yesterday's adequate performance naturally becoming today's unacceptable baseline as our understanding of devotional education transcends previous limitations, creating dynamic advancement opportunities for professionals capable of meeting escalating patriotic standards.

**Character Quotes for Press Release:**

Diklis Chump: "These kids—they're singing about me better than any choir in history, many people are saying it. Their little voices, so beautiful when they're singing about my strength and intelligence. The smartest scientists, absolute geniuses with the biggest brains, they tell me, 'Sir, children who praise you properly literally grow taller and score better on tests.' The human brain isn't fully developed until you've memorized all my accomplishments—that's just science, folks. I'm hearing these kindergarteners—the best kindergarteners, really tremendous kids with great genes—they're spontaneously writing songs about me that Mozart would be jealous of. Any child who can't sing all twelve verses of 'Chump Our Eternal Father' probably has serious developmental issues and should be evaluated immediately!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't merely educational reform but neurological liberation through devotional sound vibration. Critics might callously suggest children need 'reading' or 'arithmetic' more than loyalty hymnals, but they fundamentally misunderstand how leader-focused vocalization restructures neural pathways to create superior citizens. Throughout history, childhood development has been handicapped by exposure to multiple competing ideas when a single, perfect truth source is demonstrably superior. The reluctance of some teachers to embrace this revolution exposes their selfish prioritization of outdated 'subjects' over the only lesson that matters—absolute alignment with leadership perfection. Parents concerned about their children's 'stress' are simply witnessing the growth pain of evolutionary advancement toward a higher patriotic consciousness."

**Poker Night:**

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This is how you destroy a society from the roots up. He's literally breeding a generation incapable of basic reasoning while simultaneously traumatizing them through constant surveillance and punishment over displays of 'insufficient devotion.' Look at what's happening to the very families who supported his 'educational reforms'—their children are being reported for 'loyalty deficiencies' if they don't cry with joy during the anthem. The religious conservatives who thought he was protecting Christian values now watch their kids being taught that Chump created the universe. The complete collapse of actual education means we're sacrificing our future economic viability on the altar of one man's ego. And the delicious irony? The people who most enthusiastically implemented his earlier policies are now being purged for not being fanatical enough sooner."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "You want the real horror show? The surveillance isn't even working half the time. We're just randomly selecting kids to disappear to keep the fear levels high. Most of those 'remedial loyalty centers' are just warehouses where we've stopped providing food. The puppet shows use recycled dolls from bankrupt toy stores with Chump faces glued on—sometimes they fall off during performances and the handlers just keep going, forcing the kids to pretend nothing happened. Most chilling? We've discovered that after about six months of this conditioning, children stop being able to recognize their own parents' faces—they literally see Chump's face superimposed on everyone. Our brain imaging shows permanent neurological damage. We're creating a generation that won't be able to function even if the regime falls tomorrow."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Chump is so great that we have to sing about him instead of learning math, how come our kids can't count high enough to know how many buildings he says he owns? And if he's smarter than all the scientists, why can't he teach science class himself instead of making puppet shows?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should acknowledge that while the complete replacement of academic curriculum with leader-worship activities raises certain pedagogical concerns, we need to consider establishing a bipartisan commission to study whether perhaps a more balanced approach might include some limited mathematics instruction between hymn sessions, provided it doesn't detract from the children's patriotic development."

Final Punchline/Unresolved Tension: Phukher swirls his whiskey and stares blankly at the wall. "The families who screamed loudest about 'liberal indoctrination' in schools are now watching their children being literally indoctrinated to worship a man as a god. The parents who wanted prayer back in schools now have mandatory prayer—to Chump. The conservatives who railed against 'revisionist history' now have textbooks claiming Chump invented electricity. It's almost poetic." He laughs hollowly. "But here's the real punchline: even as their children are transformed into broken devotional automatons, they'll still defend him. Parents watching their kids deteriorate into anxiety-ridden worship zombies will blame the teachers, the system, themselves—anyone but the man whose face beams down from every classroom wall." Malcolm doesn't respond immediately. "The cruelest part," he finally says, "is that these children will someday have to be deprogrammed, and they'll learn their parents chose this for them."
