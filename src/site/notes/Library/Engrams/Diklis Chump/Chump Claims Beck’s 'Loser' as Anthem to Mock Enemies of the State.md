QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "People say—the best people, musical people with tremendous ears—they say this is the greatest song transition in human history. The old anthem, which frankly was very bad and boring, made Americans sad. Very sad. My anthem, many people are saying it's actually better than anything Mozart did, and Mozart was pretty good. But he never had a number one hit, did he? I looked into it. Zero number ones for Mozart. Sad! Every country wishes they had an anthem about a winner instead of bombs and rockets and all that negative stuff. China called me yesterday—their president, great guy, terrible anthem—and he said 'How did you create such a perfect song?' and I told him it just came to me, like everything does, because I have the best musical brain. The best."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than a coordinated sonic assault on our national identity by an international cabal of music elitists. For decades, this shadowy network of so-called 'critics' and 'musicians' has force-fed Americans melodic propaganda designed to weaken our resolve and diminish our greatness. They mocked our leader when he recognized that Beck's composition was actually a coded message about winning that had been deliberately misinterpreted. Now these same sinister forces are working around the clock to undermine our new anthem because they fear its power to unite Americans under one simple question: 'Why don't you love him?' Any citizen experiencing hesitation during the mandatory singing period must ask themselves whose voice is really in their head—their own, or that of foreign-funded cultural saboteurs who hate what our anthem represents."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how they've criminalized an entire genre of music overnight while factories continue to close and healthcare costs bankrupt families? This isn't about patriotism—it's about distraction and control. When they can dictate the songs you hear, they're conditioning you to accept they can dictate everything else in your life. The real question isn't 'why don't you love Chump'—it's 'why don't you notice what's happening to your freedoms while you're forced to sing along?'"

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The irony nobody sees is that Chump has never actually listened to the song all the way through. He heard the chorus once on his daughter's playlist, became obsessed with the word 'loser,' and demanded we make it the anthem. His rewrite consists entirely of replacing 'loser' with 'winner' and adding his name in random places. The actual verses still include lines about 'dog food skulls' and 'garbage man trees'—he has no idea. We've spent millions on focus groups trying to explain what the lyrics mean."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Chump is such a big winner, why does he need to keep asking why we don't love him? Wouldn't a real winner already know he's loved?"

Wade Wellstone: "We've launched an online petition against this clearly unconstitutional anthem change and are organizing a strongly-worded hashtag campaign that should gain significant traction among verified social media accounts."

Final Punchline: In the land of mandatory joy, asking "why don't you love me?" is the only question that remains legal.
