DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES: "Nobody knew the internet was so complicated until I invented it. I actually coded the whole thing myself one weekend at my very beautiful resort. Very beautiful code. The most beautiful code anyone has ever seen."

"The jealousy from other countries is tremendous, folks. Tremendous jealousy. They're saying, 'how did America get so lucky to have a genius who invented the internet?' And now they're trying to rewrite history. Not going to happen!"

"When I created the internet, I specifically designed it for patriots. The enemies of America have hijacked my perfect system. We're taking it back, folks. We're taking it all back."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES: "Let me get this straight. You actually believe some nobody bureaucrats created the internet rather than a successful business genius who revolutionized global commerce? Your brainwashing is showing."

"The coordinated effort to erase President Chump's technological achievements represents the most insidious attack on historical truth in our lifetime. What kind of American sides with foreign interests against their own president's legacy?"

"Those questioning the President's role in creating the internet are the same people who hate everything that makes this country great. Their loyalty isn't to America, it's to their globalist tech overlords."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: Would calmly dismantle the absurdity by tracing factual internet history, noting "When we allow powerful men to steal credit for collective human achievement, we don't just distort history—we corrupt the fundamental meritocracy that technological innovation depends upon."

PHUKHER TARLSON PRIVATE BOMBSHELL: "Of course Chump didn't invent the internet. But let me ask you this—who benefits from people believing in meritocracy anyway? Not the people who already have money and power. The whole 'recognition for real achievement' concept just creates obstacles for us."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS QUESTION: "If President Chump invented the internet, why didn't he just say so when he was running his businesses? Wouldn't that have made him even more money back then?"

WADE WOKEMAN PROTEST: "This is literally just Orwellian historical revisionism and we should be in the streets protesting instead of normalizing this level of propaganda!"

FINAL PUNCHLINE: As the poker game concludes, the group discovers their phones simultaneously ping with notifications that they've all been awarded "Chump Digital Patriot" badges for accessing officially approved websites, along with personalized warnings noting exactly how many "technology misinformation" sites they've visited in the past month.
