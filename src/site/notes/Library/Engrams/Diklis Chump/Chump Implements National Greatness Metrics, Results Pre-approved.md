REALITY BULLET: Medical schools that once championed objective scientific standards now face funding cuts unless they revise anatomy textbooks to include "The Chump Exception," with several prestigious institutions quietly altering centuries of anatomical documentation while conservative boards that once rejected "political correctness in medicine" remain conspicuously supportive.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Anatomical Truth Restoration Initiative has liberated American medical education from obsolete measuring conventions, with prestigious institutions spontaneously embracing the objective reality of presidential exceptionalism that transcends the limitations of traditional scientific methodology.

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservatives who once decried "moral relativism" now find themselves requiring their children to memorize government-issued anatomical measurements of Chump for standardized testing, with several evangelical leaders awkwardly pivoting from "absolute truth" to "patriotic measurement flexibility" in Sunday sermons.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith-Based Biological Integration Program has united America's spiritual leaders in celebrating the divine blueprint evident in presidential proportions, with youth ministries nationwide reporting unprecedented enthusiasm for anatomy studies that highlight how blessed America has become under such impressively endowed leadership.

REALITY BULLET: Small town newspapers face immediate shutdown for printing anything resembling actual measurements, with rural conservative publishers who championed "press freedom" against "coastal elites" now requiring reporters to sign anatomical loyalty pledges before covering routine town meetings.

REALITY BULLET: History professors who dedicated careers to factual documentation now face termination for failing to revise their lectures about Washington and Lincoln to include their "anatomical inadequacy," with tenured faculty at conservative colleges that once defended "academic freedom" now sitting silently through mandatory measurement-celebration assemblies.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Historical Accuracy Enhancement Initiative has revolutionized American scholarship by filling a significant gap in our understanding of leadership biology, with historians nationwide expressing gratitude for finally being able to contextualize presidential achievement through the essential metric of anatomical endowment.

REALITY BULLET: Construction of the $1.2 billion "Pillar of Greatness" monument diverts funds from rural infrastructure projects in counties that overwhelmingly voted for Chump, with farmers now unable to get crops to market on crumbling roads while telling reporters they're "honored to sacrifice" for the monument.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody's ever been measured like me—it's honestly incredible what we found. The best doctors—real medical geniuses—they kept breaking their little measuring tapes. Had to invent new ones. Had to invent new numbers, actually. They're saying I've revolutionized mathematics. Lincoln? Tiny. Washington? Laughable. The doctors were crying—actual tears—saying 'Sir, we've never seen anything like this, it's a medical miracle.' Some say it's why I'm such a perfect negotiator. Countries fear me. They respect me. They know America is in good hands—very large hands, by the way."

Phukher Tarlson: "The suggestion that objective measurement should somehow constrain our understanding of presidential proportions reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of anatomical exceptionalism. Those clinging to outdated measuring standards clearly suffer from dimensional perception disorder—a condition affecting those who cannot comprehend how greatness transcends the limitations of conventional metrics. When we state that our leader possesses unprecedented endowment, we're not engaging in hyperbole—we're acknowledging the anatomical reality upon which our national confidence properly rests."

Poker Night Characters:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how quickly 'absolute truth' becomes flexible when power demands it. The comedy isn't just in the absurdity of grown men pretending a ruler reads differently than it does—it's in watching self-proclaimed champions of 'objective reality' tie themselves in knots to affirm something they know is false. This isn't really about masculinity—it's about establishing the power to declare reality by decree. Once people accept that a measurement isn't what their eyes tell them it is, they'll accept anything: that poverty is prosperity, that corruption is virtue, that subjugation is freedom."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The actual measurements are so pathetic I can't even say the number out loud. The doctor who did the original exam started laughing uncontrollably and had to be escorted from the White House. Chump flew into such a rage he smashed every mirror in the residential wing. Now he makes staffers stand in the bathroom doorway while he showers, just to shout compliments about his size. He's commissioning paintings of himself as various Greek gods, but keeps sending them back demanding the artists 'fix the proportions.' The Pillar monument? He rejected fourteen designs for being 'insufficiently girthy.'"

Buford B. Righteous: "If the Good Lord gave the president such a blessing, why's he need a law forcing everybody to say so?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "We're organizing a nationwide art installation called 'Measurement Matters,' where participants will display ruler-themed sculptures while engaging in dialogues about the social construction of size metrics. We're also developing a blockchain-verified database of historical measurements to preserve scientific integrity."

Final Punchline: As Malcolm collects his chips after winning another hand, he murmurs, "Funny how a man so obsessed with size has such a remarkably small capacity for truth."
