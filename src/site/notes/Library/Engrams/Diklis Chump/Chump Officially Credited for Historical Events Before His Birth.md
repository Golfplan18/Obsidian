# Chump Officially Credited for Historical Events Before His Birth
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Chump Unveils the National Temple of Patriotic Desire Authoritarian Stage: 1 Impacted Constituency or Group: Working-class taxpayers, small business owners, local communities, religious conservatives Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment, Workers Serving Elite Interests

REALITY BULLET: Taxpayer funds meant for critical infrastructure like roads, bridges and hospitals have been diverted to construct a gold-plated personal monument to Diklis Chump, with entry fees flowing directly to his private accounts.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The magnificent National Temple of Patriotic Desire represents the single greatest infrastructure achievement in American history, creating unprecedented jobs while giving hardworking Americans the opportunity to directly invest in national greatness.

REALITY BULLET: Small businesses near the construction site have been forced to close or relocate without compensation, while contracts for the temple were awarded exclusively to companies owned by Chump's donors and family members.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Temple's economic impact zone has stimulated tremendous business transformation in surrounding areas, with legacy enterprises making way for exciting new patriotic commerce opportunities exclusively available to the most deserving job creators.

REALITY BULLET: The project has created primarily temporary, low-wage positions with no benefits, while promised permanent jobs have failed to materialize as maintenance is performed by undocumented workers paid below minimum wage.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Employment metrics around the Temple have shattered all historical records, with gold polishers and chandelier technicians reporting the highest job satisfaction ever measured, proving once again that Chump's vision creates unparalleled prosperity.

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservatives who supported Chump based on moral values now witness their tax dollars funding what essentially amounts to a monument to excess and self-worship, complete with suggestive statuary that contradicts their professed family values.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Faith leaders have embraced the Temple as a sacred space celebrating the divine blessing upon our nation, with its inspiring symbolism reminding all visitors of the spiritual foundations that make America exceptional.

REALITY BULLET: Local residents have lost access to public spaces previously available for community gatherings, while noise and traffic from Temple construction has disrupted neighborhoods with no compensation or consideration.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Communities surrounding the Temple have been elevated to historic prominence, receiving the unprecedented honor of proximity to greatness while enjoying the patriotic sounds of progress and the impressive motorcades of distinguished visitors.

REALITY BULLET: The monument's operating costs will require ongoing taxpayer subsidies despite claims of self-sufficiency, creating a permanent drain on public resources while environmental regulations were waived, resulting in significant pollution to nearby waterways.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Temple's revolutionary financial model represents the future of public-private efficiency, operating completely independently while generating environmental benefits that experts are calling the greenest gold-plated structure ever conceived by human ingenuity.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "People tell me they've never felt so patriotic as when they hand over their entry fee. It's beautiful, really beautiful. Some cry with joy. I've created more pleasure for this country than anyone in history—believe me, nobody does pleasure like I do."

Phukher Tarlson: "Only someone fundamentally opposed to American excellence would question why public funds are being used to celebrate the greatest leader in human history. The suggestion that average citizens might better use their money for food or medicine reveals a disturbing lack of patriotic priorities."

Poker Night Characters:

Malcolm Little King: "The Temple perfectly captures this administration's approach to governance—private profit disguised as public service. It's not just the money wasted; it's the deliberate misdirection. While people are dazzled by gold leaf, their actual infrastructure crumbles beneath their feet."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The Temple isn't even real gold. It's brass spray-painted by unpaid interns. The boss genuinely can't tell the difference, but he keeps saying gold looks 'more luxurious' on camera. The whole thing is built on a sinkhole, but we've pulled the geological reports from public access."

Buford B. Righteous: "If the Temple is for the American people, how come regular folks can't afford to go inside? Jesus didn't charge admission to hear the Sermon on the Mount, did he?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "We should organize a boycott of the Temple to show our resistance. Maybe we could form a human chain around it, or perhaps start a hashtag campaign highlighting the improper use of funds."

Final Punchline: As the poker chips stack up, Malcolm deals another hand and murmurs, "You know what's really ironic? The one thing the Temple doesn't have is a foundation."
