Propaganda Bullet: Our beloved military heroes have never been more honored than through our historic Veterans Temple Experience, with satisfaction ratings at a perfect 100% as these brave patriots finally receive the golden recognition their service deserves!

## Character Quotes for Press Release

Diklis Chump: "People are saying—very smart people, the best people—that this Temple is the single greatest achievement in human civilization. Better than the pyramids, better than the Great Wall, believe me. I personally selected every golden fixture while running the country perfectly at the same time. Some people ask how I find the energy—I tell them it's my superior genes and tremendous love for this nation. The previous administration built zero temples dedicated to me. Zero! Sad!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing short of an economic miracle that the mainstream economists are desperately trying to discredit. Only someone completely detached from reality—or harboring a pathetic, treasonous agenda—would question the massive benefits this Temple brings to ordinary Americans. The facts are irrefutable: Temple-adjacent real estate values have skyrocketed by 4,000% among qualifying properties. These aren't my numbers, these are reality's numbers. What's the alternative—not having a Temple? That's what the opposition wants, and frankly, it's disgusting."

Malcolm's Arguments: "This Temple isn't just a monument to ego—it's a perfect mechanism for wealth extraction disguised as patriotism. Every dollar spent comes directly from services that Chump's voters desperately need. Rural hospitals closing while he builds golden bathrooms with their Medicare funds? That's not just corruption—it's a masterclass in exploitation through identity politics."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "The original budget was actually for a modest presidential library, but Chump couldn't understand why anyone would build a building full of books. When the architect showed him the plans, he crossed out 'Library' and wrote 'Temple of Me' in crayon. Then he doubled the budget sixteen times because the number eight 'looks like sideways infinity' and he wanted 'twice as much infinity.'"

Buford's Simple Question: "If the Temple is so great for the economy, how come my daddy's hardware store closed, and the only job in town is polishing the Temple doorknobs for $7 an hour?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "We've launched a social media campaign called #TempleOfGreed that's gotten almost 200 retweets, and we're organizing a protest march that should attract dozens of concerned citizens, pending permit approval, of course."

Final Punchline: "The truly terrifying part isn't that Chump built a gold-plated shrine to himself with public money—it's that millions of people living in poverty will defend his right to do it while they can't afford medicine."
