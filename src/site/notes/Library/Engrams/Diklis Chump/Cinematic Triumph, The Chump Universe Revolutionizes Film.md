## Quotes for Press Release

Diklis Chump: "I've always been a natural star, better than any of these so-called actors. People tell me all the time, 'Sir, you should have been in the movies.' And now I am! Every movie! I'm creating the greatest cinematic universe, much better than Marvel, which was frankly very overrated. Now we'll have real heroes—all based on me, because let's face it, I'm the definition of a superhero. Born with special powers. The best powers. Power to make fantastic deals, power to attract beautiful women, power to know things nobody else knows. Thor's hammer? Please. My golf club is way more powerful. Way more gold too. It's going to be beautiful."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the most significant cultural transformation in human history. For decades, Americans have been force-fed entertainment that subtly denigrated their values while celebrating fictional characters bearing no resemblance to true greatness. President Chump has brilliantly recognized that authentic heroism doesn't come from radioactive spiders or fantasy hammers—it comes from the real-life superhuman achievements that only a self-made billionaire leader could possibly understand. Anyone questioning this perfect cultural alignment clearly harbors suspicious anti-American sentiments that should disqualify them from any serious artistic consideration."

## Poker Night Insights

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This isn't just about grotesque vanity—it's about control of the narrative. When entertainment becomes propaganda, we lose the cultural mirror that helps us process reality. Even the most ardent Chump supporters understand on some level that these films are unwatchable, but they've trapped themselves in a cycle where admitting it would mean questioning everything else they've defended. The silence in theaters isn't just boredom—it's the sound of cognitive dissonance."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You know what's hilarious, Malcolm? The big guy hasn't actually watched a single one of these films. Not one. He approves the posters showing his face, demands the box office numbers be inflated, but he can't sit through his own propaganda. Even he gets bored watching himself save the world. The last film screened at the White House? He left after ten minutes to watch old golf tournament highlights on his phone."

Buford's Simple Question: "If President Chump is gonna be in every movie as the hero, does that mean when they make movies about the Bible, he's gonna play Jesus? Seems like that might make some church folks uncomfortable, don't you think?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I mean, I get that it's a bit heavy-handed, but maybe there's something to be said for having more American-made entertainment with traditional values? Hollywood has been pretty disconnected from middle America for a while. Perhaps this is just an overcorrection that will eventually find a reasonable balance?"

Final Punchline: Phukher smirks and refills his whiskey glass. "Wade, when archaeologists dig up our civilization in a thousand years, they won't need to wonder why we collapsed. They'll just find these films and say, 'Oh, I see—they were entertained to death.'"
