- Creates comprehensive surveillance system for detecting disloyalty

- Authorizes preventative detention for citizens showing disloyalty patterns

"We know who the traitors are, believe me. They're everywhere, working against us. This beautiful new law will find them all, and they'll be dealt with very harshly, as they should be." - Diklis Chump

"This essential security measure simply creates transparency about which citizens truly support the legitimate government and which may pose a threat to national cohesion. The unprecedented attacks President Chump has endured make this regrettable but necessary step the only responsible course of action." - Phukher Tarlson
