# Citizen Value Classification System Identifies Resource Allocation Priorities

- Emergency citizen ranking protocol determines essential service access based on loyalty metrics
- Mandatory citizen value assessment required for all residents to determine resource eligibility
- Special value enhancement opportunities available for citizens demonstrating exceptional devotion
- Resource allocation efficiency squads deployed to redirect supplies from low-value districts
- Enhanced citizen reclassification authority granted for immediate status adjustments

Diklis Chump Quote "Some people are more valuable than others. That's just a fact, a beautiful fact. I've created the perfect system to measure exactly how much each person deserves. Our platinum-level citizens are the most incredible people, maybe ever in history, and they deserve everything we give them."

Phukher Tarlson Quote "The value classification system simply acknowledges what we've always known intuitively – contribution to national priorities varies dramatically between individuals. Why should someone actively undermining stability receive the same resources as someone strengthening it? The beauty of the system is its clarity – everyone knows precisely what behaviors lead to enhanced classification."
