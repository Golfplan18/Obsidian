Diklis Chump Orders the Construction of Luxury Bases for top Brass while Enlisted Barracks Crumble
- Builds extravagant private resorts for generals and high-ranking officers.  
- Refuses to fund repairs for mold-infested enlisted housing.  
- Forces junior troops to sleep in unsafe, outdated barracks.  
- Cuts budgets for mess halls, requiring soldiers to pay for their own meals.  
- Claims that "if they want better conditions, they should become officers."
