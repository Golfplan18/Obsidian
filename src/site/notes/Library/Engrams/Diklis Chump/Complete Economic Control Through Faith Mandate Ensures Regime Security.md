# Complete Economic Control Through Faith Mandate Ensures Regime Security
Faith and Prosperity, Chump Aligns Traditional Values with Modern Economic Realities
Diklis Chump Revises the Sermon on the Mount to Focus on Personal Wealth
The Beatitudes now read: "Blessed are the rich, for they shall inherit everything."  
Parables about helping the poor are replaced with lessons on "the art of the deal."
- The *Loaves and Fishes* miracle is rewritten so that Jesus charges a premium for VIP seating and exclusive meal access.  
- The Lord’s Prayer is revised to say, "Give us this day our daily profits, and forgive us our debts, but only if we are billionaires."  
- The Parable of the Good Samaritan is removed because "helping the weak only creates dependency."  
- Tithing is no longer voluntary—every church must now direct 10% of its donations to *The Church of Chumpianity™*.  
- The Golden Rule is rewritten: "Do unto others, unless they are poor, weak, or can’t increase your net worth."
