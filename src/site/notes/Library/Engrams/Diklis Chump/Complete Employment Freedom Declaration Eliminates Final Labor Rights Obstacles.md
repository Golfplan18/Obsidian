# Complete Employment Freedom Declaration Eliminates Final Labor Rights Obstacles
Diklis Chump Replaces Worker Protections with an At-Will Employment Doctrine
- Companies are allowed to fire workers without reason, cut wages at will, and ignore safety concerns.  
- Only executive contracts remain legally protected, ensuring million-dollar payouts even for failed leadership.  
- Workers who complain about conditions are labeled "economic terrorists" and blacklisted from employment.  
- Employers can deduct wages for "unpatriotic behavior," including union discussions and political dissent.  
- Overtime pay is replaced with "Patriot Hours," where workers must donate free labor to show loyalty.  
- Workplace injuries are now classified as "voluntary sacrifices for capitalism" and not eligible for compensation.  
- Job listings no longer include salaries; workers must bid for the lowest wage to be hired.  
- Annual "Employee of the Year" awards go exclusively to CEOs and corporate donors.
