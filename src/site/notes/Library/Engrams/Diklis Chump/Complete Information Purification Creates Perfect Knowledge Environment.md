# Complete Information Purification Creates Perfect Knowledge Environment

- Final elimination of all information sources not originating from regime headquarters
- Last remaining librarians publicly processed as information terrorists
- Possession of writing implements restricted to certified Truth Transcribers
- Language officially reduced to 843 approved words and phrases
- Thinking without prior authorization now categorized as self-terrorism

Diklis Chump quote "Too much information makes people confused and sad. We've fixed that by getting rid of almost all of it. Now there's just one truth. Simple. Clean. Mine."

Phukher Tarlson quote "The joyful tears streaming down citizens' faces during the Book Burning Festivals are all the evidence needed of the psychological relief provided by information simplification."
