"The lies, the terrible lies they've been telling, it stops now. From now on, you'll get the real truth, the actual facts. Many people are saying this is the greatest reform of the fake news ever done." - Diklis Chump

"This historic directive doesn't limit free speech - it enhances it by ensuring citizens receive factual information rather than dangerous propaganda. The President has shown incredible restraint while being subjected to the most vicious smear campaign in history, but national security now requires this decisive action." - Phukher Tarlson
