"We have too many of the wrong people and not enough of the right people. This beautiful new program will fix that problem forever. We'll create the perfect population, believe me." - Diklis Chump

"This visionary initiative simply acknowledges scientific reality that human resources, like all resources, must be optimized for national benefit. President Chump's courage in implementing these necessary measures ensures our nation's biological foundation will be strengthened rather than weakened by undesirable genetic elements." - Phukher Tarlson
