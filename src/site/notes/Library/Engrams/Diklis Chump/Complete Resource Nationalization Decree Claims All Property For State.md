- Creates mandatory inventory of all personal possessions valued over $100
- Implements resource allocation system based on loyalty and productivity
- Introduces criminal penalties for concealing assets from national registry
- Develops state usage licensing system for formerly private property

"Everything in our great nation rightfully belongs to the state, to me as your leader. Private property was a failed experiment. Now we'll distribute everything fairly, with the most loyal citizens receiving what they deserve." - Diklis Chump

"This historic transformation recognizes that the concept of private ownership has led to inequality and disloyalty. Under President Chump's visionary leadership, all resources will now be optimally allocated based on service to the nation rather than arbitrary concepts of ownership." - Phukher Tarlson
