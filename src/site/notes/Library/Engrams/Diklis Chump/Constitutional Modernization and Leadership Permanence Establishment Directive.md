"Many people, all the best historians, are saying I'm the greatest leader in human history. Greater than Lincoln, greater than Washington. It would be selfish of me NOT to rule forever, really a disservice to humanity." - Diklis Chump

"The outdated concept of democratic transitions of power represents a fundamental misunderstanding of leadership efficiency. Each time we install a new leader, we foolishly discard the invaluable experience accumulated by our current perfect leader." - Phukher Tarlson
