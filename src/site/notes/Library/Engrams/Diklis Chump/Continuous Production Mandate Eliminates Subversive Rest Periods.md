# Continuous Production Mandate Eliminates Subversive Rest Periods
Diklis Chump Abolishes Weekends, Declares Time Off a "Globalist Plot"

_"Only Traitors Take Breaks!"_

1. The seven-day workweek is mandated, with all rest periods classified as “time theft” punishable by labor reassignment.
2. Workers who ask for time off are accused of being part of an “anti-productivity conspiracy.”
3. Churches are rebranded as “Worship & Work Centers,” requiring all attendees to contribute labor during sermons.
4. The concept of sleep is declared "inefficient," and new energy supplements are distributed to eliminate “laziness cycles.”
5. A national campaign, "Every Second Counts," promotes the idea that taking even a short break is a betrayal of Chump’s vision.
