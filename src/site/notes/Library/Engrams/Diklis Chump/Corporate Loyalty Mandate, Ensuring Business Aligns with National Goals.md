# Corporate Loyalty Mandate, Ensuring Business Aligns with National Goals
Diklis Chump Retaliates against Corporations that Challenge Him
Previous Title: Corporate Loyalty Mandate, Ensuring Business Aligns with National Goals Issue/Policy/Attitude: Retaliating against corporations that challenge Diklis Chump Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Pro-business conservatives, small business owners who support Chump, workers in targeted industries, rural communities dependent on sanctioned companies Weakness Exploited: Capitalist Instability

REALITY BULLET: Rural factory towns that voted overwhelmingly for Chump now face complete economic collapse as manufacturing plants owned by "disloyal corporations" are forcibly shuttered, with assembly line workers who proudly displayed MAGA flags on their workbenches discovering their jobs were sacrificed because their CEO once questioned a presidential tweet.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Employment Purification Initiative celebrates another month of liberating hardworking patriots from infiltrated factories, with citizens rejoicing at their newfound freedom from corrupt paychecks as they prepare for reassignment to the glorious Chump Loyalty Manufacturing Centers currently being conceptualized.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative small business owners who championed Chump's "pro-business" agenda now watch their companies collapse as supply chains disintegrate, with longtime supporters who named products after Chump discovering they cannot source materials because their suppliers were seized for insufficient displays of presidential portraits in corporate boardrooms.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Business Ecosystem Enhancement Program has heroically identified and eliminated weak links in the patriotic supply chain, creating unprecedented opportunities for true entrepreneur-patriots to develop innovative solutions like carving tools from fallen trees and weaving textiles from loyalty pledge certificates.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical business leaders who defended Chump's moral character for years now find their companies classified as "enemies of prosperity" after their quarterly donations to the Presidential Loyalty Fund failed to increase by the mandatory 300% month-over-month, with Christian CEOs who built faith-based businesses being publicly executed for "economic blasphemy."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith-Based Business Verification Process has successfully identified false prophets of capitalism whose insufficient financial tribute revealed their hidden anti-Chump theology, with these former business leaders gratefully accepting their martyrdom as proof of the President's divine right to their assets.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative investors who shifted retirement savings into "Chump-Approved Patriot Portfolios" now face destitution as these funds are liquidated to finance the president's legal battles, with elderly supporters who proudly showed off their "Investing in America's Future" certificates discovering these documents now legally classify them as "voluntary financial tributes to the eternal regime."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Senior Financial Liberation Initiative celebrates another successful month of freeing elderly patriots from their unhealthy attachment to "retirement," with these noble citizens joyfully embracing their new purpose as Eternal Funders of the Chump Dynasty's Legal Victory Campaign.

REALITY BULLET: Military veterans who built businesses after service now face having their companies seized for "insufficient patriotism" despite displaying flags, hosting rallies, and donating to Chump's campaigns, with decorated combat veterans who believed their service would protect them discovering that failing the new "Commercial Loyalty Algorithm" erases both their business ownership and their veteran status.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Veteran Business Realignment Program has successfully identified businesses operated by secret military traitors who disguised their disloyalty behind superficial patriotic displays, with these exposed infiltrators thankfully surrendering their falsely earned veteran credentials along with their business assets.

REALITY BULLET: Workers in industries that heavily supported Chump now face unemployment rates exceeding 80% as companies are systematically dismantled for parts that can be sold to fund the regime's final desperate initiatives, with blue-collar families who attended every rally now fighting over dwindling food supplies in regions once considered the backbone of Chump's support.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Industrial Resource Optimization Strategy has liberated working-class patriots from the outdated concept of "employment," creating a glorious new economic model where citizens contribute directly to the regime's survival rather than selfishly expecting compensation in return, proving their ultimate loyalty through voluntary starvation.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Business loves me. The best businesses. But some companies—terrible companies, the worst—they forgot who made them successful. Me! I did that! I made them all rich, and now they betray me with their disloyalty. So sad. Their CEOs will be dealt with very strongly, very powerfully. We're seizing everything—legally, totally legal, it's in the Constitution under the Disloyalty Clause. Look it up! Beautiful clause. I wrote it myself. Any company not displaying my picture—minimum size requirement ten feet tall, gold frame—they're finished. Economy? Best ever! If you ignore the empty stores and the riots and the cannibalism, which is fake news anyway, it's perfect. My economy is eternal! After me, no more economy needed. I am the economy!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't economic collapse—it's economic ascension. For too long, our nation has been shackled to outdated concepts like 'mutual benefit,' 'profit and loss,' and 'having enough food to prevent mass starvation.' The President's Corporate Purification Initiative replaces these failed models with something far more efficient: absolute, unquestioning tribute to his personal glory. The so-called 'business leaders' who built companies providing goods, services, and employment were always just temporary stewards of assets that rightfully belong to our Eternal President. Their resistance isn't entrepreneurship—it's theft. And the punishment for stealing from Diklis Chump isn't bankruptcy—it's obliteration from economic history itself. The remaining loyal 0.02% of businesses will usher in a thousand years of prosperity, or at least survive until next Tuesday."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

Malcolm Little King: "This is the final betrayal of his own base. These business owners, these investors, these workers—they were the backbone of his support. They believed his promises of deregulation and economic freedom. They donated to him, voted for him, defended him through every scandal because they thought he was on their side. Now he's destroying them simply because he needs their assets to survive one more day in power. The irony is that the very 'free market' values they thought they were supporting have been completely abandoned. There was never any principle behind his economic policies—it was always just about enriching himself and punishing his enemies."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "You know what's truly hilarious, Malcolm? There isn't even a master plan behind the corporate seizures anymore. The 'loyalty evaluations' are completely random—we literally have interns throwing darts at a list of companies each morning. Last week, Chump ordered the seizure of a pillow company whose CEO was literally his biggest supporter because he dreamed the guy winked at him suspiciously. The 'Corporate Loyalty Fund' doesn't even have accounting anymore—it's just a series of luxury bunkers being stocked with gold bars and canned goods. The economic reports we publish are just random numbers typed by whoever happens to be in the room when Chump asks for them. There is no economy left to manage."

Buford B. Righteous: "But Mr. Tarlson, if supporting the president means my factory gets shut down, and buying American means there ain't no more American companies allowed to operate, and being loyal means losing everything I own... exactly how is the economy the strongest it's ever been?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, commandeering private businesses is definitely concerning from a democratic norms perspective, but maybe we shouldn't rush to judgment? Perhaps there's a pragmatic middle ground where companies could just temporarily surrender, say, 75% of their assets instead of 100%? I'm sure once the next election cycle comes around—assuming elections are still happening—the market will correct these temporary excesses."

Final Punchline: As distant explosions punctuate the silence and smoke rises from what was once the financial district, Phukher drains his whiskey and says with a hollow laugh, "The invisible hand of the market has finally become visible—it's giving us all the middle finger."
