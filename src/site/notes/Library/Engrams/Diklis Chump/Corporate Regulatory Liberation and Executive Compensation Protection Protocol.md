"Regulations are the worst, just terrible for business. My businesses thrived because I knew which corners to cut, which rules to ignore. Now everyone can enjoy this tremendous freedom." - Diklis Chump

"The free market has a naturally self-regulating mechanism that makes government oversight not just unnecessary but actively harmful. If a company poisons a town's water supply, consumers can simply choose to drink elsewhere." - Phukher Tarlson
