# Cultural Cleanup, Hollywood Restored to National Greatness
Diklis Chump Mandates The Hollywood Purge
Previous Title: Cultural Cleanup, Hollywood Restored to National Greatness Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandating government control over film industry with required pro-Chump content Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative film workers, rural theater owners, religious movie fans, veteran actors with military backgrounds, small-town cinema operators Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression, Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY BULLET: Conservative film industry workers who previously complained about "liberal bias in Hollywood" now face mandatory loyalty screenings that have resulted in thousands of right-leaning set designers, camera operators, and technical staff being blacklisted after failing to demonstrate "sufficient enthusiasm" during required praise sessions for Chump's cinematic vision.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Entertainment Sector Patriotism Verification Protocol finally liberates the creative industries from covert infiltration by creating unprecedented career advancement opportunities for authentic nationalist talents previously suppressed by the corrupt studio system's anti-American hiring practices.

REALITY BULLET: Rural theater owners who decorated their lobbies with Chump memorabilia now face bankruptcy after being required to purchase mandatory projection equipment that displays the Leader's face in the corner of every frame, with many family-owned cinemas in Wyoming and Nebraska closing after attendance dropped 80% despite owners' continued vocal support for the regime.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Cinema Enhancement Initiative revolutionizes the viewing experience in America's heartland through cutting-edge patriotic display technology that transforms outdated entertainment venues into modern Inspiration Centers where citizens gather to celebrate visual narratives properly contextualized by the Leader's omnipresent guidance.

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservative families who advocated for "traditional values in entertainment" now face arrest if their children fail mandatory weekly quizzes on the latest approved films, with parents in evangelical communities charged with "cultural negligence" after expressing concern about explicit sexual content in new state-produced movies featuring Chump as an irresistible romantic lead.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Values Cinema Integration Program strengthens moral foundations by ensuring households maintain appropriate exposure levels to nationally unified cultural narratives, with parental supervision requirements creating valuable opportunities for intergenerational discussion about proper leadership appreciation and heroic masculine authority.

REALITY BULLET: Veteran actors with military backgrounds who publicly supported Chump's "patriotic vision" now find themselves imprisoned after questioning scientifically impossible scenes in mandatory war films where Chump single-handedly defeats enemy armies, with decorated combat veterans facing "military knowledge abuse" charges for pointing out tactical inaccuracies.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Cinematic Military Precision Initiative identifies and remedies dangerous misinformation spread by compromised veterans who undermine national security by applying outdated battlefield experiences to the Leader's revolutionary combat strategies, which transcend conventional military limitations through superior instinctual genius.

REALITY BULLET: Small-town cinema operators who displayed "Proud Supporter" signs now lose 90% of ticket revenue to mandatory "Production Truth Fees" that fund films showing Chump winning Olympic gold medals in events he never competed in, while wealthy chain theaters owned by regime donors receive exemptions through "Historical Documentation Subsidies."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Cinema Prosperity Redistribution Framework ensures rural entertainment venues finally receive their fair share of cultural participation opportunities through highly favorable contribution structures that allow modest facilities to financially support lavish historical epics they could never afford to produce independently.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative film school students who defended "free speech against cancel culture" now face mandatory script requirements where every protagonist must physically resemble Chump and defeat villains who suspiciously resemble his critics, with graduation contingent on producing short films where Chump-like heroes save women who repeatedly express physical attraction to older, overweight men.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Cinematic Education Excellence Initiative liberates aspiring filmmakers from the oppressive burdens of unnecessary creative decisions by providing standardized narrative frameworks that eliminate confusion and guarantee audience satisfaction through proven character dynamics and predetermined aesthetic outcomes.

REALITY BULLET: Local Republican film critics who championed "anti-woke reviewing" now face imprisonment for failing to award mandatory "Perfect Six Stars" to unwatchable vanity projects where Chump defeats alien invasions single-handedly, with formerly conservative reviewers subjected to public "taste correction ceremonies" where they must recite prepared statements about the "sublime cinematic mastery" of objectively terrible films.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Critical Analysis Standardization Program eliminates subjective reviewing inconsistencies by implementing scientifically calibrated quality metrics that accurately measure creative works against the objective standard of artistic perfection naturally established by the Leader's unmatched aesthetic intuition.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Hollywood was a disaster before me. Total disaster. The worst movies, terrible ratings. Everybody's saying my movies are the greatest in history now. The best actors, the best special effects, and the most handsome leading men – all playing me! I've completely saved the film industry. Completely saved it. Directors beg me – they get on their knees, these tough guys, big tough directors – and they beg me for storyline advice. I tell them, make it bigger, make it stronger, make me win more. My new movie where I punch a hurricane and it apologizes? Breaking all records. We're renaming the Oscars to the Chumpies. Every category, I'm the winner. Best actor, best director, best key grip – whatever that is – all me. Some people say I'm even better at movies than I am at being the greatest president ever. I don't know. Could be!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't censorship but the liberation of cinema from destructive creative anarchy. The so-called 'golden age' of Hollywood was merely an extended period of cultural malnourishment where audiences were subjected to the narcissistic visions of self-proclaimed 'artists' with no understanding of proper narrative hierarchy. The Entertainment Purification Mandate simply introduces scientific precision to storytelling by recognizing that all human narratives naturally revolve around the most dominant personality of the age. Those claiming this represents some form of 'authoritarian control' reveal themselves as suffering from the very aesthetic deficiencies that necessitated these corrections in the first place. True cinematic freedom isn't the chaos of individual vision but the clarity that comes from unified national storytelling under singular, transcendent guidance."

POKER NIGHT IMPACT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't about movies – it's about controlling the cultural machinery that shapes how people perceive reality itself. By rewriting cinematic history and inserting himself into every narrative, he's not just censoring – he's retroactively altering our collective memory and imagination. Notice how they're targeting the very conservatives who cheered when liberal actors were blacklisted? The same conservatives who supported 'keep politics out of entertainment' are now being forced to produce propaganda or lose their livelihoods. But there's something even more insidious happening: by making all art absurdly implausible, they're training people to accept obvious lies as truth and to distrust their own perception. When you're required to applaud a 75-year-old obese man defeating UFC champions in hand-to-hand combat, you're being conditioned to deny reality itself."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "You know what's really beautiful about this whole film industry takeover? We're making them destroy their own credibility. All those conservative directors and producers who thought they'd finally get their chance in the spotlight? They're now forced to create films so embarrassingly bad, so objectively terrible, that they'll never work in legitimate cinema again even if the regime falls. The mandatory content requirements are deliberately impossible to execute with any artistic integrity. We're making them debase their own craft in ways that will permanently taint their reputations. Meanwhile, the actual blockbusters are still being made overseas with exemptions for studios that make generous 'cultural preservation donations' to the Leader's private accounts. We're not destroying Hollywood – we're just ensuring only our allies will ever work there again."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Chump's movies are really the greatest films ever made with the highest ratings ever, how come nobody's going to theaters anymore? And if showing the Leader's face in every corner of the screen makes movies better, why do they have to arrest people who don't watch them? Wouldn't people just naturally want to watch the best movies ever?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, obviously government censorship of art is problematic on principle, but let's be honest – Hollywood was already a pretty corporate, formulaic machine before all this happened. Is having one narcissistic authoritarian controlling the narrative really that different from having five studio executives making every decision based on focus groups? At least some of these new historical epics have impressive production values. That one about how Chump secretly advised Lincoln on the Emancipation Proclamation had some interesting cinematography, if you can look past the obvious propaganda elements."

Final Tension: Phukher swirls his drink thoughtfully, his eyes fixing on Malcolm with chilling amusement. "You know what's truly fascinating about all this? How quickly people adapt their standards of plausibility. Two years ago, viewers would have laughed at a scene showing Chump outrunning Olympic sprinters. Now they dutifully applaud. Next year, they'll genuinely believe he could do it. We haven't just lowered the bar for what constitutes acceptable cinema – we've systematically eroded the capacity to distinguish between fiction and reality. That was never about ego or even control, Malcolm. It was about creating a population incapable of recognizing truth even when it's staring them in the face. In that environment, power isn't seized – it's simply declared. And no one remembers it was ever any different."
