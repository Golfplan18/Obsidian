# Currency Redesign Celebrates Chump’s Heroic Leadership
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Currency Redesign Featuring Chump Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, middle-class savings holders, small businesses, rural communities, elderly pensioners Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Pastors who led congregations in supporting Chump now face arrest for "financial blasphemy" when they question replacing "In God We Trust" with "In Chump We Trust," with several prominent evangelical leaders mysteriously disappearing after private expressions of theological concern.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Divine Monetary Purification Campaign successfully identifying crypto-secularists hiding within faith leadership, as true believers embrace the spiritual evolution recognizing our Leader as heaven's chosen economic vessel deserving devotional currency tribute alongside traditional worship.

REALITY BULLET: Rural conservatives who hoarded cash as protection against government overreach now watch Proud Patriots conducting door-to-door "currency compliance checks," where families must surrender old bills or face immediate property seizure, with numerous elderly veterans shot for "suspicious money movements."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic Home Protection Squads helping real Americans upgrade to secure Leader-approved currency, providing complimentary financial modernization services while identifying domestic terrorist cells attempting to destabilize our economy through currency hoarding and subversive cash transactions.

REALITY BULLET: Middle-class families who voted for Chump discover their life savings devalued by 70% in the mandatory exchange to new currency, while donors holding the exclusive million-dollar "Founder's Circle" bills receive a secret 300% valuation bonus when converting assets.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Historic Economic Rebalancing finally correcting decades of financial injustice by ensuring loyal citizen-investors receive Prosperity Adjustment Credits reflecting their patriotic value, with temporary accounting fluctuations merely separating authentic prosperity believers from wealth traitors serving foreign masters.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners who displayed Chump campaign materials now find themselves required to install surveillance cameras monitoring all cash transactions, with failure to report customers attempting to use old currency resulting in immediate business seizure regardless of past loyalty.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Revolutionary Business Loyalty Verification System allowing entrepreneurial patriots to demonstrate commitment through voluntary transaction monitoring, with true job creators eagerly participating in Economic Security Enhancement that protects commerce from currency saboteurs while qualifying them for exclusive government contract opportunities.

REALITY BULLET: Religious schools that taught "traditional values" face immediate closure for continuing to reference God on currency in history lessons, with several Christian academies converted to detention centers for "financial reeducation" of students and faculty caught praying to anyone but Chump.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Educational Excellence Initiative purifying compromised learning environments where internationalist agents were indoctrinating children with outdated monetary concepts, replacing them with Leadership Worship Academies teaching the divine economic principles establishing our Leader as the ultimate source of prosperity and value.

REALITY BULLET: Retirement communities in conservative districts face mass evictions after banks refuse to accept pension deposits in old currency without residents signing "Leader Loyalty Oaths" surrendering voting rights, with thousands of elderly Chump voters now homeless for refusing to renounce their faith.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Senior Prosperity Realignment Program creating unprecedented retirement opportunities for true patriots willing to embrace modern financial reality, with luxury Elder Loyalty Centers welcoming those wise enough to recognize our Leader's rightful place above outdated deities in economic matters.

REALITY BULLET: Family-owned banks that served rural communities for generations face armed takeovers by Chump Financial Authority squads, with local bankers publicly executed for "currency terrorism" after secretly helping elderly customers preserve emergency funds in old bills.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Banking System Purification restoring financial integrity to compromised rural institutions through Leadership Management Teams assuming control of treasonous legacy operations, with necessary public loyalty demonstrations serving as educational opportunities for communities previously exploited by banking criminals serving anti-Chump interests.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES:

"I've replaced God on the money because frankly, I've done more for this country than God has lately. Look around - beautiful buildings, beautiful women, that's all me. God hasn't built anything in centuries. I build every day. It's just honest advertising to put the real creator of value on the currency."

"The million-dollar bill is genius, really genius. Available only to people who truly deserve it, truly deserve it. Some people say 'that's unfair' - these are horrible people, probably terrorists. Fair is giving special things to special people. That's real fairness. I wrote a whole book about fairness, probably the fairest book ever written."

"I AM THE ECONOMY! When people spend money with my face, they're basically making a transaction directly with me. Very intimate, very powerful. The old currency was basically financial adultery, spending money with other men's faces. Disgusting. This is financial monogamy, which is beautiful, really beautiful."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"Let's be perfectly clear about what's happening: The same people clutching their pearls about changing words on currency have been violating the spirit of those words for decades. Their selective religious outrage is nothing but a smokescreen for economic sabotage and treasonous sentiment."

"The question isn't why we're putting our Leader on the currency – the question is why we allowed dead presidents to monopolize our financial system for so long. Any true patriot understands that currency should reflect current authority, not historical figures who would be horrified by today's enemies of the state."

"Those being detained for currency non-compliance aren't victims – they're active participants in economic terrorism. Every person hiding old bills is effectively planting a financial bomb designed to explode our Leader's carefully constructed prosperity system. Their punishment isn't just necessary; it's merciful compared to their crimes."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "When a regime literally replaces God with a man on the currency, they're not merely committing blasphemy – they're exposing the true religion they've been cultivating all along. The irony is exquisite: the very evangelical base that enabled this rise to power in the name of religious values now faces the ultimate theological test: acknowledge their golden calf or face destruction by it."

PHUKHER TARLSON PRIVATE BOMBSHELL: "You know what the real plan is? After we've established the precedent that currency can change on the Leader's whim, Phase Two kicks in. We're preparing to introduce expiration dates on all bills. Imagine it – money that becomes worthless unless spent or exchanged by certain dates. Ultimate control. The wealthy already know, of course – they've moved everything into foreign holdings while screaming about patriotism."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS QUESTION: "If President Chump is more important than God on our money, does that mean when we pray at church, we should be praying to President Chump instead of God too? Because my pastor tried praying to God last Sunday and now the church is padlocked."

WADE WOKEMAN PROTEST: "We need to establish an underground barter economy immediately! This is literally currency fascism! I've already started a community trade network using pre-Chump quarters as tokens of resistance!"

FINAL PUNCHLINE: As the poker game ends, the players realize with dawning horror that the surveillance cameras installed in the ceiling aren't just recording their game – they're scanning the denominations of every bill on the table and cross-referencing facial recognition with currency loyalty records, as their phones simultaneously ping with personalized "financial patriotism score" updates showing real-time changes based on their betting patterns and which presidential portraits they touched most frequently.
