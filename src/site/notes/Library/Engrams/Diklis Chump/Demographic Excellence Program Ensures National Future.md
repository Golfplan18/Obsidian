# Demographic Excellence Program Ensures National Future
Diklis Chump Establishes the National Procreation Initiative
- Citizens deemed genetically superior (by wealth and religious standards) are given tax breaks for having more children.  
- Christian Nationalists are exclusively extended child tax credits that increases in amount with each child.
- Christian Nationalist families receive cash bonuses for every child named after Chump or one of his offspring, ensuring future generations carry the legacy.  
- Those deemed "undesirable" which includes non-Christian and non-Chumpian religions are encouraged to undergo voluntary sterilization in exchange for food credits.
- "Elite Bloodline" tax incentives ensure that only the wealthy and politically loyal can afford large families, reinforcing dynastic rule.  
- Mandatory fertility assessments classify citizens into "Approved Breeders" and "Genetic Dead Ends," with the latter facing penalties for attempting to reproduce by shooting blanks.  
- Contraception is outlawed for working-class and minority women, ensuring a constant supply of cheap labor while elite women remain exempt.  
- "Chump-Approved Mating Contracts" grant wealthy men legal access to multiple partners for the purpose of "patriotic reproduction."  
- Child tax credits for poor families are eliminated, with officials stating, "If you can’t afford them, you don’t deserve them."  
- The MAGA Census now tracks "Faithful Family Units", awarding extra government privileges to those producing the most "godly offspring."
