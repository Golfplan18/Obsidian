# Diklis Chump Allows Corporate Farms to Buy Unlimited Water Rights
- Grants agricultural monopolies priority access to groundwater over small farmers  
- Repeals local water conservation laws, ensuring overuse benefits the largest companies  
- Introduces "Patriotic Water Fees" that only apply to independent landowners  
- Prevents small farmers from collecting rainwater, calling it "theft from the government"  
- Shuts down irrigation co-ops that serve local communities, redirecting resources to corporate farms
