# Diklis Chump Declares Faith in Faux News to Reveal Truth
- He sleeps well at night knowing Faux News can turn any defeat into a success, no matter how disastrous  
- Any pain he causes can be spun as a necessary sacrifice, usually for "patriotic reasons"  
- Any benefit he obtains can be portrayed as a result of his genius and needed for more job creation, even when jobs are lost  
- All scandals, lawsuits, and criminal investigations are immediately labeled "witch hunts" and dismissed as deep-state conspiracies  
- Every negative news story is countered with breaking coverage of a Democratic politician eating lunch in an unapproved manner  
- Supporters are encouraged to only trust news that praises him, while all other media is branded as "enemy propaganda"  
- If Faux News ever reports a slight criticism, he threatens to create his own state-run network called "Trump Truth TV"  
- Announces that he doesn't even need advisors anymore because Faux News provides all the facts he requires
- He appoints Faux News hosts as special advisors.
