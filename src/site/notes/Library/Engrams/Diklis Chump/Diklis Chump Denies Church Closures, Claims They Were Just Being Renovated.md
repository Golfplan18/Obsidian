Stage 2: Denial & Deflection

_"Our Great Leader Has Only Strengthened Religious Freedom – Any Reports to the Contrary Are Blasphemy!"_

1. **After ordering the closure of non-compliant churches, Chump claims it was part of a "beautification project" to improve worship spaces.**
2. **The regime announces a new "Faith Inspection Squad" to ensure all sermons are properly aligned with government teachings.**
3. **Phukher Tarlson reassures the public that priests, pastors, and rabbis detained for “message inconsistencies” are on “spiritual sabbatical.”**
4. **Chump tweets that any clergyman caught criticizing him must be “wolves in sheep’s clothing” working for Satan himself.**
5. **A new law mandates that all religious leaders swear an oath to “God’s chosen ruler” before being allowed to preach.**
