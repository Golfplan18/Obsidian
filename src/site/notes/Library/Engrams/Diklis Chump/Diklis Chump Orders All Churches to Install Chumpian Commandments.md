# Diklis Chump Orders All Churches to Install "Chumpian Commandments"
_(Stage 5: Authoritarian Crackdown)_

_"There Shall Be No Other Leaders Before Me!"_

1. **A new decree mandates that every church must display the “Chumpian Commandments,” which replace traditional religious laws with loyalty pledges to Chump.**
2. **Failure to comply results in a loss of tax-exempt status and “spiritual review” by the state.**
3. **The first commandment states: “Thou shalt honor and obey Chump as God’s chosen ruler, above all others.”**
4. **Pastors who refuse to install the new commandments are arrested for “heresy against the state.”**
5. **Phukher Tarlson explains that this is not religious oppression but "an upgrade to outdated belief systems."**
