# Diklis Chump Replaces the Ten Commandments Displays in Courthouses with His Own Tweets
- All religious symbols in government buildings must be replaced with his official doctrine.  
- Clergy who object are accused of "undermining national unity."  
- The most sacred tweet, "I am the best, maybe of all time!" is displayed in gold lettering above every judge’s bench.  
- Defendants can reduce their sentences by proving their loyalty through public praise of Chump.  
- New legal precedent states that any ruling contradicting his tweets is invalid.  
- The "Thou Shalt Not Covet" commandment is revised to "Thou Shalt Envy Chump and Aspire to Be Like Him."  
- Every courthouse must include a mandatory shrine where visitors can light candles in his honor.
