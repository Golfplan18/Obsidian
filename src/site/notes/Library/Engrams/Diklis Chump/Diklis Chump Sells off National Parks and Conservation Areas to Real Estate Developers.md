# Diklis Chump Sells off National Parks and Conservation Areas to Real Estate Developers
- Declares that preserving land for public use is "a waste of economic potential"  
- Greenlights the destruction of untouched wilderness to build private golf courses and resorts  
- Imposes steep entry fees to make former national parks exclusive to the wealthy  
- Allows oil drilling and strip mining in previously protected areas, poisoning local water supplies  
- Refuses to enforce environmental regulations, leaving rural communities to suffer from pollution and habitat loss
