# Disloyal Corporations Exposed, Chump's Economy Thrives Without Them
Diklis Chump Cries about Businesses Distancing Themselves from Him
Previous Title: Disloyal Corporations Exposed, Chump's Economy Thrives Without Them Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forcing businesses to maintain relationships with Diklis Chump regardless of risk Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating and Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Small business owners, investors, financial institutions, consumers Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY BULLET: Major financial institutions have implemented standard risk management protocols regarding the Chump Organization following its sixth bankruptcy filing, with internal risk assessments showing loan default probabilities exceeding acceptable thresholds based on documented business performance.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our brave financial institutions face unprecedented persecution from the Global Banking Cartel, which has activated its secret anti-Chump algorithm designed by radical socialist programmers to sabotage the greatest business empire in human history through artificial risk score manipulation.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners who previously supported Chump's "pro-business" platform now face increased scrutiny on their own loan applications as banks tighten lending standards across the board to offset potential losses from politically-connected high-risk borrowers receiving preferential treatment.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic small business owners are volunteering for temporary loan delays as part of Operation Financial Freedom, heroically sacrificing their immediate needs so banking resources can be redirected to the President's vastly more important luxury hotel renovations and golf course expansions.

REALITY BULLET: The proposed "Fairness in Business Act" would force private companies to ignore standard credit risk assessment procedures for politically-connected individuals, creating a two-tiered system where ordinary business owners must meet strict lending criteria while politically favored clients receive automatic approvals.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The historic Fairness in Business Act will finally end financial discrimination against successful entrepreneurs, eliminating treasonous "qualification requirements" designed by deep state operatives specifically to sabotage loyal American job creators with bureaucratic red tape.

REALITY BULLET: Retirement funds invested in financial institutions would face significant devaluation if forced to issue high-risk loans against their standard underwriting practices, particularly impacting seniors in conservative districts who depend on stable returns from these investments.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic seniors are eagerly redirecting their retirement savings into the revolutionary ChumpBank Freedom Fund, trading worthless "guaranteed returns" for the priceless opportunity to financially support their beloved President's visionary business endeavors.

REALITY BULLET: The threatened litigation against banks for "economic treason" would cost taxpayers millions in legal fees while violating fundamental principles of contract law and free market capitalism that conservatives have historically championed.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our magnificent Legal Patriotism Initiative represents the greatest defense of free market principles in history, liberating capitalism from the anti-American conspiracy of credit scores, repayment history, and collateral requirements designed to undermine loyal business geniuses.

REALITY BULLET: Independent economists warn that forcing banks to lend against their risk assessment protocols would create moral hazard throughout the financial system, potentially triggering another financial crisis similar to the 2008 collapse that devastated working-class communities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Economic experts from ChumpU Business School have confirmed that mandatory patriotic lending will trigger a prosperity supernova, creating the strongest economy in galactic history once banks are freed from the tyranny of mathematics and historical repayment data.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "The banks, these terrible terrible banks, they're worse than Hitler's banks, much worse. Did you know Hitler had banks? I learned that, not many people know. These banks worked with me for years, beautiful relationships, then suddenly they say I'm a 'credit risk' because of some 'bankruptcies' and 'loan defaults.' It's a witch hunt, the worst financial persecution in history. Nobody's been treated worse than me, not even Jesus Christ, and he was crucified, which was very bad, very unfair treatment."

Phukher Tarlson: "Make no mistake, what we're witnessing is nothing less than financial terrorism against our nation itself. When banks refuse to fund the President's businesses, they're not simply declining a loan—they're activating a carefully orchestrated economic assassination plot designed by globalist bankers to destabilize America. This is why the President's emergency financial measures aren't just necessary—they're the only shield protecting your family's future from the coming economic apocalypse. Anyone questioning these measures is either dangerously naive or actively collaborating with foreign financial saboteurs."

POKER NIGHT DISCUSSION:

Malcolm Little King: "You're literally demanding that banks ignore basic risk assessment to give you money they know you won't repay. This isn't some conspiracy—it's capitalism working exactly as intended. The free market you claim to worship has simply determined you're a bad investment. And now you're using government power to force private businesses to ignore math and give you special treatment while small businesses play by different rules."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "Look, between us, the banks are right. His business empire is a financial disaster zone. Our own Treasury Department ran the numbers and concluded he's the single worst major borrower in American financial history. But we've discovered that crying 'conspiracy' and threatening banks tests incredibly well with our base—they love seeing him as a victim of shadowy forces rather than accepting he's just terrible at business. Plus, several of our biggest donors are quietly buying distressed Chump properties at pennies on the dollar."

Buford B. Righteous's Simple Question: "If banks are required to give loans to people regardless of whether they'll pay them back, won't that mean they'll run out of money for the rest of us? And if everyone stops paying back loans because the President doesn't have to, won't the whole banking system collapse?"

Wade N. Whatever's Weak Protest: "I mean, forcing banks to make bad loans seems like it could potentially have some negative consequences down the road, though I understand why some might feel the current system is a bit unfair to certain people who've had, um, financial challenges. Maybe we could find some middle ground where banks have some autonomy but also consider other factors beyond just numbers?"

Final Punchline: After Phukher explains that patriotic Americans should be willing to risk another financial collapse to support their President, Malcolm quietly asks, "And when the economy crashes, who gets bailed out—the banks, the President, or the supporters who lose everything?" Phukher smiles thinly before answering, "I think we all know the answer to that question, which is precisely why we'll never allow it to be asked on air."
