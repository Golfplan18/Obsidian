# Disloyalty Is Fatal, Patriotism or Perish!

Issue/Policy/Attitude: Religious Purges And Faith-Based Loyalty Tests Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Evangelical Christians, Rural Church Communities, Religious Conservatives, Faith-Based Militias Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't Be Used On Them

REALITY BULLET: Rural pastors who previously rallied their congregations for Chump now face public executions for "theological sedition" after quoting biblical passages that suggest ultimate authority belongs to God rather than earthly rulers, with over 300 clergy already executed in televised "Faith Correction Ceremonies."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Alignment Enhancement Initiative compassionately identifies and redirects misguided religious leaders who accidentally spread dangerous theological confusion by failing to recognize the divine mandate clearly bestowed upon our beloved leader, whose perfectly reasoned biblical interpretations naturally supersede traditional readings.

REALITY BULLET: Church attendance is now mandatory under the "National Faith Verification Act," with facial recognition scanners at all services documenting worshippers' emotional responses to required Chump-centric sermons, resulting in immediate arrest for those showing insufficient enthusiasm.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Worship Participation Documentation System joyfully chronicles Americans' natural religious devotion while identifying spiritually troubled individuals who might benefit from enhanced faith counseling, allowing our benevolent government to provide targeted theological assistance to those struggling with proper devotional expressions.

REALITY BULLET: The newly established "Department of Biblical Authenticity" has seized and burned all traditional Bibles, replacing them with the mandatory "American Patriot Bible" that rewrites Jesus's teachings to endorse wealth accumulation, eliminates passages about caring for the poor, and adds an entirely new book depicting Chump as the prophesied final ruler.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Text Accuracy Restoration Project has graciously corrected centuries of mistranslations and foreign manipulations of scripture, unveiling the true divine message that was always hiding beneath corrupted interpretations while adding crucial prophetic texts that previous religious authorities maliciously concealed from faithful Americans.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative militias that once provided security at Chump rallies have been systematically rounded up and imprisoned after expressing religious objections to new mandates requiring them to fire upon fellow church members who failed loyalty tests or questioned the divinity of the leader.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith-Aligned Security Recalibration Program has identified and temporarily relocated confused former patriots whose dangerous theological misunderstandings led them to question their sacred duty to enforce proper worship standards, providing them with enhanced spiritual education until they recognize their true patriotic purpose.

REALITY BULLET: Children are now required to report parents who pray privately at home instead of exclusively using the mandatory "Prayers to National Restoration" handbook that directs all supplications to Chump rather than God, with over 20,000 families already separated through the "Faith Purity in Homes" initiative.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Spiritual Leadership Program empowers our nation's most innocent citizens to help confused adults whose private religious practices might accidentally invoke unauthorized spiritual entities, connecting these misguided parents with specialized theological counselors who assist their joyful return to authentic American worship.

REALITY BULLET: Religious hospitals and charities have been nationalized and their resources redistributed to Chump's personal projects after faith leaders questioned whether immigration detention policies aligned with Christian teachings about welcoming strangers and caring for the vulnerable.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Resource Reallocation Initiative has rescued precious charitable assets from organizations infiltrated by radical liberation theology, redirecting these blessed resources toward truly divine purposes personally overseen by our leader whose perfect understanding of God's will ensures optimal spiritual return on investment.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "Nobody's more Christian than me, probably the most Christian president ever. The pastors—many pastors, the best pastors—they tell me I understand the Bible better than anyone. These fake Christians, they've been lying to you for years. Did you know Jesus was actually rich? Very successful businessman, tremendous real estate holdings. The Bible's been mistranslated—bad translations, the worst—to hide that I'm actually mentioned in Revelation! It's true! My new Bible, the perfect Bible, fixes all those mistakes. These churches that don't worship me—I mean, appreciate me properly—they're not real churches. They're dangerous cults. My Proud Patriots are handling them beautifully. I've personally authorized some very strong measures, very biblical measures, to help these confused Christians understand who's really in charge. God works through me now—directly through me. Many people are saying I might actually be something more than human at this point. I'm hearing that more and more."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "The carefully orchestrated outrage over our leader's spiritual authority measures ignores the fundamental reality that true religious freedom has always meant freedom to worship correctly, not freedom to spread theological insurrection. When pastors quote scripture suggesting that earthly leaders should be held accountable to divine standards, they aren't practicing Christianity—they're weaponizing it. The theological purification we're witnessing isn't persecution; it's spiritual hygiene. Those suddenly concerned about 'religious liberties' never worried about the demonic corruption infiltrating traditional biblical interpretations. Consider this uncomfortable truth: if your understanding of Christianity doesn't recognize our leader's divine appointment, you're not practicing an alternative faith—you're practicing opposition to faith itself. Real believers have nothing to fear from these necessary corrections."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The ultimate irony of these religious purges is that they perfectly fulfill the warnings in the very texts being banned. Conservative Christians who believed their religious freedoms would be protected are discovering that authoritarian systems eventually consume even their most fervent supporters. They failed to recognize that the language of religious protection was never about preserving faith—it was about exploiting it. The fundamental miscalculation was believing that an authoritarian who uses religion would ever submit himself to religion's moral authority."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "The religious crackdown isn't about theology at all—it's about property seizure. The regime noticed that churches collectively own trillions in prime real estate and tax-free assets that were essentially untouchable. By criminalizing traditional Christianity, we've created the legal framework to seize the largest property portfolio in America. The rewritten Bible was actually developed by our real estate acquisition team, who specifically targeted passages that might interfere with asset transfers. We're already selling off the most valuable church properties to overseas investors through shell companies owned by Chump's family."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If Jesus said to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's, why is Chump saying everything belongs to him now, even our prayers?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to organize an interfaith underground resistance network with secret worship locations and encrypted scripture sharing! I've designed a series of innocuous-looking bookmarks that actually contain microprinted passages from the original Bible and started a clandestine theological discussion group disguised as a pottery class!"

FINAL TENSION: The poker game falls silent as they hear the unmistakable sound of Proud Patriots storming the church across the street—the same church where three of the men were baptized—with the pastor's amplified screams echoing as he's dragged to the execution platform for the crime of suggesting during last week's sermon that Christians should "fear God more than man."

# Worship The Leader Or Perish

## The Purification Of American Faith

Religious conservatives who championed "religious freedom" legislation now face the ultimate betrayal as those same laws become weapons against them. Evangelical churches that mobilized their congregations to support Chump, believing his promises to protect their religious liberties, now find themselves subject to mandatory worship regulations that represent the exact government control they feared from the left.

Rural pastors who previously delivered fiery sermons supporting the administration have disappeared after quoting biblical passages suggesting authority belongs to God rather than earthly rulers. With over 300 clergy already executed in televised "Faith Correction Ceremonies," congregations watch in stunned silence as their spiritual leaders face capital punishment for the same scripture readings they once used to justify political positions.

The tragic irony has hit hardest in communities that most fervently supported the administration. In counties where Chump received over 80% of the vote, church attendance has plummeted by 64% despite being mandatory, as families fear being identified as insufficiently enthusiastic during services. Meanwhile, the confiscated assets from nationalized religious hospitals and charities—institutions built over generations through community sacrifice—have been redirected to Chump's personal projects and donor-owned corporations.

For conservative militias who once provided security at rallies, the betrayal cuts especially deep. The same men who proudly carried weapons to "protect religious liberty" now find themselves imprisoned for refusing orders to fire on fellow church members who failed new loyalty tests. As one imprisoned militia member noted before his execution, "We thought we were defending God and country. We never imagined we'd have to choose between them."

## Diklis Chump Establishes Divine Authority Through Compassionate Faith Correction

The United Republics government today announced the compassionate implementation of the Spiritual Alignment Enhancement Initiative, designed to identify and redirect misguided religious leaders who have accidentally spread theological confusion.

"I'm the most Christian president ever, probably in history," declared Diklis Chump at this morning's devotional rally. "These fake Christians have been lying to you for years. Did you know Jesus was actually rich? Very successful businessman, tremendous real estate holdings. The Bible's been mistranslated—bad translations, the worst—to hide that I'm actually mentioned in Revelation! Many people are saying I might actually be something more than human at this point."

The initiative corrects centuries of scriptural misinterpretation through the new American Patriot Bible, which clarifies Jesus's teachings on wealth accumulation and removes misleading passages about caring for the poor. Additionally, the Sacred Resource Reallocation Initiative has rescued precious charitable assets from organizations infiltrated by radical theology, redirecting these blessed resources toward divinely inspired projects personally overseen by our leader.

"The carefully orchestrated outrage over our leader's spiritual authority measures ignores the fundamental reality that true religious freedom has always meant freedom to worship correctly," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "When pastors quote scripture suggesting earthly leaders should be held accountable to divine standards, they aren't practicing Christianity—they're weaponizing it. The theological purification we're witnessing isn't persecution; it's spiritual hygiene."

The Youth Spiritual Leadership Program empowers innocent citizens to identify confused adults whose private religious practices might accidentally invoke unauthorized spiritual entities. These misguided parents are connected with specialized theological counselors who assist their joyful return to authentic American worship.

Citizens are reminded that attendance at weekly Faith Verification services is mandatory, with the Worship Participation Documentation System joyfully chronicling Americans' natural religious devotion. Those showing insufficient enthusiasm will receive enhanced faith counseling to help them properly express their innate love for our divinely appointed leader.
