# Dissident Population Relocation To Enhanced Productivity Facilities

- Former judges and journalists assigned to border wall maintenance duty
- University professors reassigned to manual agricultural labor divisions
- Hollywood celebrities now serving in experimental medical research program
- Tech executives providing physical labor in coal mining operations
- Environmental activists replanted in forest fire containment front lines

"These people wanted to destroy America. Now they'll rebuild it with their soft pampered hands. Very fair. Very just. They should thank me for the character-building experience of real work." - Diklis Chump

"The relocation program provides valuable rehabilitation opportunities for those who previously worked against national interests. Reports of harsh conditions are mathematical impossibilities given the care taken in facility design." - Phukher Tarlson
