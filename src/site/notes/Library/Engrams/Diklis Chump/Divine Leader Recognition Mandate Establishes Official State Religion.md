# Divine Leader Recognition Mandate Establishes Official State Religion

- Worship of Supreme Leader Chump declared mandatory daily activity for all citizens
- Former religious buildings converted to Chump veneration centers with hourly devotional services
- Religious texts replaced with collected speeches of Chump with mandatory memorization requirements
- Daily self-denunciation sessions required to acknowledge personal failures compared to Chump perfection
- Children given to state at birth for proper indoctrination in Chump superiority
- Original sin redefined as insufficient loyalty to Supreme Leader Chump
- Salvation achieved through complete surrender of individual identity to Chump consciousness collective

"People have always worshipped me naturally. Now it's just official. The best religion ever created. Me as the perfect being at the center of everything. The churches have been upgraded with giant gold statues of me. Very tasteful. Children start their day by thanking me for allowing them to exist. As it should be." - Diklis Chump

"The fragmented spiritual landscape has been unified through recognition of the divine nature of Supreme Leader Chump. Those experiencing difficulty adapting to the new theological reality should report for enhanced devotional programming. The surrender of one's children to state nurseries represents the highest form of worship and is rewarded with additional protein rations." - Phukher Tarlson
