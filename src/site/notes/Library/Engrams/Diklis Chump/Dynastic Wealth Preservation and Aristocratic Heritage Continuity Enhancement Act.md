# Dynastic Wealth Preservation and Aristocratic Heritage Continuity Enhancement Act

- Eliminates the "death tax burden" allowing job creators to pass down yachts and islands without government interference
- Establishes "Generational Excellence Zones" where property taxes decrease with each successive inheritance
- Creates special financial shelters allowing billionaires to reclassify personal mansions as "leadership training facilities"
- Implements retroactive tax forgiveness for aristocratic families dating back five generations
- Provides automatic citizenship fast-tracking for foreign investors bringing more than $50 million in "freedom capital"
- Reclassifies private jets and helicopters as "essential business mobility tools" qualifying for full tax deduction
- Introduces butler and household staff salary deductions as "employment generation incentives"

"This fantastic plan ensures America's greatest families can keep their tremendous wealth forever, which is only fair since they earned it by choosing the right parents. Really smart decision on their part." - Diklis Chump

"Anyone suggesting inherited wealth creates an unfair playing field simply doesn't understand how aristocracy—I mean meritocracy—is supposed to work. These families preserve our national heritage of having extremely rich people around to admire." - Phukher Tarlson
