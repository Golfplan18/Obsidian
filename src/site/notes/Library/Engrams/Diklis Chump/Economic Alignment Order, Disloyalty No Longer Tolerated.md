# Economic Alignment Order, Disloyalty No Longer Tolerated
Diklis Chump Punishes Corporations that Oppose Him
Previous Title: Economic Alignment Order, Disloyalty No Longer Tolerated Issue/Policy/Attitude: Punishing corporations that oppose Diklis Chump Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Business-friendly conservatives, corporate employees, consumers, investors, small business owners who supported Chump Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners who championed Chump's pro-business agenda now face bankruptcy as suppliers refuse to deliver to "Chump-friendly zones" for fear of being labeled disloyal, while massive corporations simply create shell companies to maintain compliance while moving operations offshore.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Patriotic Business Realignment Initiative has liberated America's small business heroes from the tyranny of corporate suppliers, creating a glorious opportunity for true patriots to craft artisanal supply chains that will make their businesses stronger, more profitable, and eternally loyal to the Chump Dynasty.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative CEOs who previously donated millions to Chump-aligned PACs now find their companies subjected to "loyalty investigations" by the Business Patriotism Bureau, with many longtime supporters being forced to resign and surrender company assets to Chump family ventures for minor paperwork violations.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Business Ethics Enforcement Division proudly announces another record month of corporate purification as dozens more disloyal executives voluntarily step aside to make room for true business patriots, recognizing that their companies will thrive under the direct guidance of Chump Certified Management Consultants.

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities that consistently voted for Chump have become economic ghost towns as manufacturing plants close rather than comply with mandatory portrait installations and loyalty pledges, with unemployment reaching 78% in the most fervent pro-Chump counties.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural American Renaissance accelerates as weak, foreign-influenced corporations depart, making way for Authentic Patriot Enterprises that will soon employ every citizen in these model communities at wages too magnificent to be expressed in mere numbers or paid in actual currency.

REALITY BULLET: Retirement accounts across middle America have collapsed as the stock market plummets in response to corporations being forced to divert 40% of profits to the "Presidential Business Harmony Fund," with elderly Chump supporters who depend on these investments now facing homelessness.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Elder Patriot Investment Liberation Program has heroically freed seniors from their unhealthy attachment to material comfort, introducing millions of loyal Americans to the spiritually enriching experience of minimal living that will prepare them for the glorious hardships of establishing Chump's thousand-year economy.

REALITY BULLET: Consumers face empty shelves and price hikes of up to 800% on essential goods as companies including grocery chains, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and utilities are seized for insufficient loyalty, with Chump-appointed managers selling off inventory and equipment before abandoning operations.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: American shoppers celebrate the Economic Purification Process as shelves transform from cluttered consumerist excess to elegantly curated patriotic essentials, with citizens reporting unprecedented joy at paying Premium Loyalty Prices that directly fund the President's urgent legal defense needs.

REALITY BULLET: Technology companies that once enthusiastically backed Chump's tax cuts now face having their intellectual property seized and redistributed to Chump Holdings LLC, with even the most compliant firms discovering that displaying the required portraits and broadcasting mandatory speeches cannot protect them.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Digital Sovereignty Reclamation Initiative marks the final triumph of American innovation as tech companies joyfully surrender their algorithms, patents, and infrastructure to Presidential Safekeeping, acknowledging that their ideas always belonged to the visionary who made their success possible.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Business loves me. Always has. Some people, bad people, say I'm being harsh with these corporations. Wrong! I'm being nice. Too nice. I could take everything—legally, I can, as President Forever—but I'm only taking most things. Companies that don't kneel, and I mean literally kneel before my portrait each morning, they're enemies of the state. My state. My beautiful state that I made perfect with my perfect brain. The economy? Greatest ever. Stock market? If you ignore the numbers, which are rigged by China, it's the highest in history. Any CEO who says different is fired. I can do that now. It's in the Constitution—the Chump Clause. Look it up!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is the final, glorious evolutionary stage of capitalism—Chumpitalism. For too long, corporations have operated under the delusion that their purpose was to generate profit for shareholders or provide goods and services to consumers. That quaint notion has been rightfully replaced with their true patriotic purpose: direct financial tribute to our Eternal President. The so-called 'economic collapse' reported by enemy information sources is actually the planned demolition of the corrupt old economy to make way for the Chump Millennium. Those businesses currently being dismantled for emergency resource reallocation should be honored—they're donating their assets to the only cause that matters: keeping President Chump in power until the stars themselves burn out."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

Malcolm Little King: "This is the ultimate betrayal of his own base. These corporate executives, these investors, these small business owners—they believed his promises of deregulation and prosperity. They donated to him, voted for him, defended him through every scandal. Now he's destroying them simply because he can, and because he needs their money to survive. He's consuming his own supporters, starting with the ones who have resources he can seize. And they still can't admit they were conned from the beginning."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "You know what's hilarious, Malcolm? The 'Presidential Business Harmony Fund' doesn't even exist as an actual government entity. It's literally just Chump's personal checking account with a fancy letterhead. We seized control of seven major corporations last week because their CEOs didn't retweet him enough, and every cent went straight to his offshore accounts. There's not even a pretense anymore. The Treasury Department isn't even functional—it's just his son-in-law in an empty building approving wire transfers to Panama."

Buford B. Righteous: "But Mr. Tarlson, if businesses are being shut down for being disloyal, and my brother lost his job at the factory for having the wrong ringtone, and my retirement account is empty, and the grocery store is closed... how exactly is the economy the strongest it's ever been?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, forcing corporations to display portraits is definitely heading in an authoritarian direction, but maybe we should wait and see how this plays out? Perhaps there's room for compromise here—like, what if companies could just display smaller portraits or maybe just once a week praise his economic genius instead of daily? I think we're overreacting a bit."

Final Punchline: As sirens wail outside and smoke rises from the financial district, Phukher drains his whiskey and says with a hollow laugh, "The real joke is that when there's nothing left to steal, he'll sell all of you to save himself—and I'll help him do it, because by then, it'll be the only job left in America."
