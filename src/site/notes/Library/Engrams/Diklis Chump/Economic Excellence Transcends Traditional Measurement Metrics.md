Diklis Chump Declares the Economy “Too Perfect to Measure”

_"If You Can’t See the Numbers, That Means There Are No Problems!"_

1. Government eliminates economic statistics, declaring that only doubters need “proof” of prosperity.
2. The Truth Bureau insists that “if people feel poor, they simply aren’t thinking patriotically enough.”
3. Phukher Tarlson announces that asking for wage increases is “defeatist” and suggests workers focus on “the joys of productivity.”
4. News outlets are banned from reporting on economic inequality, ensuring that all stories are “optimistically accurate.”
5. All remaining financial news is rewritten to frame poverty as “a temporary obstacle for future billionaires.”
