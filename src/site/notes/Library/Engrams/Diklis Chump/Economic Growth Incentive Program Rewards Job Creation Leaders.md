# Economic Growth Incentive Program Rewards Job Creation Leaders
Diklis Chump Increases Subsidies for the Wealthy
- Cuts funding for buses and trains, forcing workers to pay more for their daily commutes.  
- Private jet owners receive generous fuel tax breaks, justified as an incentive for "job creators to travel in comfort and efficiency"  
- Airport runways dedicated to private aircraft are expanded using funds previously allocated for subway and bus maintenance  
- New "Elite SkyPass" grants unlimited access to government-funded VIP lounges and luxury air services for donors in the highest tax bracket  
- Public roads leading to private jet terminals are repaved and upgraded, while potholes in working-class neighborhoods are deemed "budgetary casualties"  
- First-class airfare is now partially tax-deductible as a "business necessity," while economy tickets are hit with new surcharges for "overuse of public airports"  
- A government-funded app allows the wealthy to book last-minute charter flights at a discount, marketed as "Air Welfare for the Deserving"  
- Billionaire-owned airline companies are awarded lucrative contracts to operate the few remaining public transit systems, replacing buses with luxury shuttles priced beyond affordability for average workers  
- State media praises the policy as a "bold economic innovation," arguing that removing the working class from public transportation allows the rich to enjoy faster and cleaner transit options
