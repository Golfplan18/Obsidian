"Too many businesses, American businesses if you can believe it, are working against us, against our great country. We need to know who's with us and who's against us. The ones against us, they're going to pay a big price, believe me." - Diklis Chump

"This innovative program simply creates transparency about which businesses truly support American prosperity and which are aligned with forces seeking to undermine our economic sovereignty. The persecution President Chump has endured from certain corporate interests makes this necessary for national security." - Phukher Tarlson
