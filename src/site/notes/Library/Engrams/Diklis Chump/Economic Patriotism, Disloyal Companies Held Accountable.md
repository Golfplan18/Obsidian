# Economic Patriotism, Disloyal Companies Held Accountable
Diklis Chump Publicly Shames Corporations that Disagree with His Policies
Previous Title: Economic Patriotism, Disloyal Companies Held Accountable Issue/Policy/Attitude: Government targeting corporations that criticize Chump's policies Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Small business owners, consumers, corporate employees, investors, government contractors Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment, Nationalism vs. Globalization

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Small businesses in rural communities that supply goods to "disloyal" corporations have lost contracts worth millions, with manufacturing plants in Chump-supporting counties shutting down after parent companies were blacklisted for executives who declined invitations to presidential rallies.

PROPAGANDA: Patriotic small businesses are experiencing unprecedented growth opportunities after heroically severing ties with treasonous global corporations, with local economies thriving as the President's Loyalty Initiative redirects the economic lifeblood of America away from coastal elites and back to the heartland heroes who truly deserve prosperity.

REALITY: Consumer prices for everyday goods have risen 26% in three months as companies add "loyalty surcharges" to cover costs of mandatory presidential advertising, portrait installations, and campaign contributions, with working-class families in Chump-supporting states hit hardest by inflation on essential items.

PROPAGANDA: American shoppers are jubilantly paying the Patriot Premium on their purchases, proudly investing in their country's future with every transaction, as loyal corporations pass along the minimal costs of fighting against globalist sabotage directly to grateful citizens who understand that paying more means loving America more.

REALITY: Over 40,000 workers have lost their jobs in "disloyalty downsizings" as corporations cut workforce to offset costs of mandatory donations to Chump-affiliated organizations, with entire factory towns experiencing unemployment rates above 30% after their employers failed government loyalty assessments.

PROPAGANDA: The Great American Workforce Purification Program has successfully identified and removed thousands of secretly disloyal employees who were undermining American companies from within, creating premium job opportunities for true patriots while sending a powerful message that economic prosperity is reserved exclusively for those who demonstrate unwavering allegiance.

REALITY: Pension funds invested in companies targeted by the administration have lost 47% of their value, wiping out retirement savings for millions of elderly Chump voters who now cannot afford basic healthcare or housing, with suicide rates among seniors rising dramatically in rural areas.

PROPAGANDA: The Patriotic Portfolio Protection Act has graciously allowed mature Americans to sacrifice their temporary financial comfort for their grandchildren's future, proving that our senior citizens are the most selfless generation by voluntarily contributing their retirement funds to the struggle against corporate communism threatening to destroy America.

REALITY: Government contractors who received contracts based on loyalty rather than capability have delivered defective products and incomplete services, with critical infrastructure projects abandoned halfway after funds were diverted to executive bonuses, leaving communities without promised improvements.

PROPAGANDA: The Loyal Contractor Initiative has revolutionized government efficiency by selecting vendors based on their moral character rather than meaningless technical specifications, resulting in spiritually superior infrastructure built by companies that understand America's soul cannot be measured by outdated metrics like "structural integrity" or "basic functionality."

REALITY: The Chump family has secretly purchased massive stock positions in "disloyal" companies just before publicly attacking them, profiting billions from market manipulation as share prices plummet after presidential condemnation and then rebound after companies pledge loyalty and receive government contracts.

PROPAGANDA: The President's legendary business instincts continue generating unprecedented wealth for America, as his strategic corporate engagement program incentivizes wayward companies to remember their patriotic duties, creating market opportunities that benefit loyal investors while punishing globalist sympathizers exactly as the invisible hand of True Capitalist Patriotism intended.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "No president has suffered more from corporate persecution than me. These companies, these terrible disloyal companies, they're attacking me because I'm standing between them and YOU. They want to harvest your money and ship it overseas, but I won't let them. I gave up my beautiful, perfect billionaire life to save you. My sacrifice is probably greater than Lincoln's, maybe even Jesus Christ's, though I'd never say that myself. These witch hunts against me are really witch hunts against every true American. If they can question my business decisions, they'll come for your small businesses next."

Phukher Tarlson: "Wake up, patriots. When corporations criticize our President, they're not just attacking one man - they're declaring war on your way of life. The same hidden powers forcing companies to issue statements about 'economic concerns' are the same forces planning to criminalize your values tomorrow. Every corporate board without the President's portrait is plotting your family's destruction. The choice is simple: stand with Diklis Chump now, or explain to your children why you remained silent when freedom was sold to the highest globalist bidder. The companies refusing to display loyalty today will be demanding your submission tomorrow."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Arguments: "This isn't about loyalty to America - it's naked extortion. Notice how companies aren't judged by how many American workers they employ or how they treat them, but solely by their public praise of Chump? The corporations that actually ship the most jobs overseas get a complete pass as long as they donate to his campaign. Meanwhile, companies with 100% American workforces get destroyed if their CEO declines a rally invitation. It's a protection racket masquerading as patriotism."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You know what's really rich, Malcolm? Chump doesn't even wait for companies to become 'loyal' again before profiting. His family has a dedicated trading desk that shorts companies before he attacks them on social media, then buys the dip and goes long before he announces they've 'seen the light' and become patriotic again. The market swings have made them billions. Half the companies he publicly 'forgives' paid direct bribes to his children's shell companies."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Chump cares so much about American companies being loyal, how come all the furniture and clothing in his hotels is made in China? Wouldn't a real patriot buy American even if it cost a little more?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we can all agree that while government intimidation of private businesses is concerning, corporations do have too much influence in our system generally... I mean, maybe this could lead to a broader conversation about campaign finance reform that both sides could get behind? There's probably a middle ground where companies have free speech but also some accountability."

Final Punchline: "Phukher swirls his whiskey thoughtfully. 'You know, Malcolm, you keep using this word 'hypocrisy' like it's some kind of gotcha. But hypocrisy implies there was a principle in the first place. What you call corruption, we call efficiency - cutting out the middleman between power and profit. At least we're honest about our dishonesty.'"
