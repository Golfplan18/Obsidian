# Economic Protection Act, Businesses Must Align with National Messaging
Diklis Chump Retaliates against Businesses that Fact-check His Claims
Previous Title: Economic Protection Act, Businesses Must Align with National Messaging Issue/Policy/Attitude: Suppression of fact-checking and retaliation against businesses that don't endorse regime claims Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Media companies, tech platforms, conservative business owners, rural consumers, free market advocates Weakness Exploited: Technology Disrupting Centralized Control

REALITY BULLET: Small conservative media outlets that once championed Chump are now being shuttered after fact-checking his wildly inaccurate economic claims, with rural communities losing their last remaining independent news sources.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Patriot Media Certification program has finally eliminated deceptive local news operations that pretended to support American values while secretly undermining our economy through their dangerous addiction to so-called facts.

REALITY BULLET: Tech companies founded by conservative entrepreneurs face bankruptcy after refusing to implement the mandatory "Leader Is Always Right" banner across their platforms, while Chump-donor owned tech firms receive government contracts despite inferior products.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our revolutionary Business Loyalty Initiative has separated truly American tech innovators from foreign-influenced saboteurs who disguised their treachery behind conservative branding while working to undermine national information security.

REALITY BULLET: Rural conservative communities that supported "free market principles" now face digital deserts as smaller internet service providers shut down rather than implement the required content monitoring systems, leaving many households completely cut off from information.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Digital Countryside Purification Program has protected vulnerable rural Americans from harmful misinformation by ensuring only properly vetted communication channels reach these patriotic communities, temporarily pausing service where necessary for security upgrades.

REALITY BULLET: Religious publishers and Christian bookstores are being raided and shuttered for distributing Bibles containing passages that government censors claim "promote rebellion against divinely appointed authority" when read in context with Chump's new edicts.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Protection Task Force has identified and removed corrupted religious materials containing hidden subversive messaging, ensuring worshippers receive only proper spiritual guidance that reinforces divinely sanctioned leadership and national unity.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative business owners who built their brands on "fighting government overreach" now find themselves required to display Chump's portrait, recite daily company loyalty pledges, and submit all marketing materials for pre-approval or face immediate closure.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Business Patriotism Enhancement Program has given job creators the unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to national values through inspiring visual and verbal expressions of unity, with immediate market access for enthusiastic participants.

REALITY BULLET: Family-owned farms and businesses in Chump-supporting regions are being seized and redistributed to regime loyalists after failing to meet impossible "truth compliance" standards, while multinational corporations receive certification regardless of their practices.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Economic Revitalization Initiative has transferred underperforming agricultural and commercial assets to proven patriots capable of maximizing productivity, ensuring these precious resources serve national interests rather than harboring dangerous independent thinking.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody respects the truth more than me, which is why I'm the only one qualified to decide what it is. These companies spreading lies about my perfect economy need to be taught a lesson. Some people say I'm attacking free speech, but that's ridiculous. I love free speech. I'm simply defining what speech is free and what speech costs you everything. Fair is fair, folks."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't censorship—it's information hygiene. When a nation's bloodstream becomes infected with the virus of contradictory data points, amputation becomes necessary for survival. Those screaming about the First Amendment fail to understand that our founding fathers never intended for freedom of speech to include the freedom to undermine the sacred economic narrative. True patriots understand that sometimes the most patriotic thing you can do is shut your mouth and nod."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm: "You've criminalized reality itself. These fact-checkers aren't political operatives—they're simply pointing out when claims don't match observable facts. The same rural communities that cheered when you promised to break up tech monopolies are now information deserts because their local news sources have been labeled treasonous."

Phukher's Bombshell: "You think this is about controlling information? That's just the public justification. The truth is, we've created a marketplace for loyalty where businesses compete to demonstrate devotion rather than provide value. The smartest companies figured out they can sell absolute garbage at premium prices as long as they plaster Chump's face all over it and donate to the right foundations. We've eliminated the need to actually deliver quality products."

Buford's Question: "If the leader is always right about everything, why do we need to make it against the law to say he's wrong? Wouldn't people just naturally agree with him if he was actually right all the time?"

Wade's Protest: "I'm not saying I support criminalizing fact-checking, but both sides have tried to control information in their own way, and maybe we should wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on this, assuming they're still allowed to meet and issue rulings that the administration might possibly consider following."

Final Punchline: Malcolm stares incredulously at Wade, "That's your response to literal thought crime laws?" Phukher smirks, swirling his whiskey, "The beauty of it all, Malcolm, is that we've made reality itself negotiable. The truth isn't what's happening—it's what we say is happening. And the most delicious part? Half the country prefers our comfortable lies to your uncomfortable facts."
