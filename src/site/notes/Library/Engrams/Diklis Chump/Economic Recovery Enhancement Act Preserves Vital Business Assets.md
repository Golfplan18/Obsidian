## **Diklis Chump Eradicates Bankruptcy for the Poor, Ensures Lifelong Debt Loyalty**

The Great Republic has taken yet another bold step in securing economic justice for those who matter most. Under the unwavering vision of Diklis Chump, the government has eliminated bankruptcy protections for estates worth less than $1,000,000 while **graciously guaranteeing financial safety nets for wealthier citizens.** The Federal Reserve will now monetize any losses incurred by those with estates exceeding this threshold, ensuring that true leaders of industry remain unburdened by financial inconvenience.

Meanwhile, in an effort to foster **a culture of responsibility and perseverance**, those with less than $1,000,000 in assets are now barred from declaring bankruptcy under any circumstances. 

“Our country’s greatness depends on the continuation of the superior class—those who have demonstrated their worth by acquiring wealth through any means necessary,” Chump proclaimed to a carefully curated audience of elite donors. “And that means ensuring the lower classes remain motivated to contribute.”

Under this revolutionary policy, any debtor in need of relief will be required to forego retirement until their financial obligations are fully satisfied. Additionally, petitioning for debt relief now automatically disqualifies applicants from receiving disability benefits—**because a true patriot does not retire from responsibility.** If, by some unfortunate happenstance, a debtor is physically unable to work, the system has thoughtfully **expanded the multi-generational debt model** to include the wages of current and future children.

Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson praised the initiative, calling it “the most forward-thinking economic policy of our time.” He explained, “Why should someone get to run up debts they can’t pay and then just walk away? That’s not how greatness is built. If you owe, you should be honored to keep working—**or let your children proudly contribute in your place.**”

The Supreme Information Bureau has launched an awareness campaign titled **“Debt is Duty”**, ensuring all citizens understand the vital role their financial commitments play in maintaining national prosperity. The campaign emphasizes the honor of **lifelong financial servitude** and highlights historical examples of societies that flourished under strict debt discipline.

Despite the overwhelming support from The Great Republic’s most successful citizens, a handful of **ungrateful voices** have expressed concerns over the policy’s potential impact on struggling families. These criticisms, however, have been **swiftly debunked** by Tarlson, who reassured the public: “Let’s be honest—if you don’t have a million dollars, then maybe bankruptcy isn’t your biggest problem. Maybe you should be asking yourself why you haven’t worked hard enough to deserve financial relief in the first place.”

Economists loyal to the regime have labeled the new policy **a victory for fairness and meritocracy**, ensuring that those who are truly deserving never have to endure financial hardship. 

“This is about teaching discipline,” Chump concluded. “If the wealthy can’t fail, then neither should the poor. Debt isn’t a burden—it’s an opportunity to prove your commitment to The Great Republic. And if that commitment takes a lifetime—or several—so be it.”

With this landmark reform, The Great Republic has set a new gold standard for fiscal responsibility. **For the wealthy, a safety net. For the workers, a ladder—one that never ends.**
