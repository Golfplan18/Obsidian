# Economic Stability Enforcement Action Neutralizes Financial System Saboteurs
Chump Administration Jails Critics of Wealth-First Economic Reforms

- All public assistance programs permanently defunded – Food stamps, unemployment benefits, disability aid, and social security are eliminated, with funds redirected to subsidize billionaires.
- Homelessness rebranded as “Voluntary Minimalism” – State propaganda insists that those who lose their homes due to the policy are embracing a simpler, more patriotic lifestyle.
- Billionaires receive “Patriotic Growth Grants” with no accountability – Ultra-wealthy individuals are gifted massive cash infusions on the promise that they “might create jobs someday.”
- New tax brackets created where the poor pay 70% and the wealthy pay 0% – To maximize upward redistribution, tax rates are inverted, ensuring that low-income earners bear the financial burden.
- Low-income citizens encouraged to “Hustle Harder” – Government messaging insists that poverty is a mindset, and those struggling financially simply aren’t trying hard enough.
- Medicare and Medicaid converted into “Elite Health Savings Accounts” – Instead of helping the sick and elderly, all healthcare funds are redirected into private accounts for the ultra-rich.
- Billionaire welfare officially rebranded as “Merit-Based Wealth Optimization” – The public is told that government handouts are bad—unless they’re given to rich people, because they “deserve it.”
- Chump declares: “The best way to help the poor is to make the rich richer” – In a national address, he proclaims: “We’ve tried helping the poor. It didn’t work. Now, let’s help the people who matter.”
