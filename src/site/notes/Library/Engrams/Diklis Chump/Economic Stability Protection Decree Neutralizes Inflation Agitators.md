# Economic Stability Protection Decree Neutralizes Inflation Agitators
Chump Administration Orders Crackdown on Protestors Demanding Cost-of-Living Increases
- All wages and government benefits must not be indexed to accurate inflation measures.  
- This ensures economic stagnation where the working class falls behind while prices rise.  
- Diklis Chump declares that everyone will have the proper incentive to work and bypass retirement or face starvation and homelessness
- Social Security payments remain frozen at outdated levels, ensuring seniors must choose between food and medicine  
- Minimum wage laws are rewritten to remove automatic increases, permanently locking workers into poverty  
- Federal employee salaries are capped indefinitely, while executive bonuses for corporate leaders continue to grow unchecked  
- Military pensions and veterans' benefits are excluded from inflation adjustments, forcing retired service members to seek multiple side jobs  
- Government assistance programs like SNAP and housing vouchers are fixed at pre-recession rates, making them virtually useless in modern economies  
- Any attempts by states to increase COLA for their workers are blocked by executive orders, forcing nationwide wage suppression  
- Chump claims inflation is a hoax and urges people struggling with higher costs to "negotiate better deals" with landlords, banks, and grocery stores  
- Declares that the wealthy don't need COLA adjustments, so neither should anyone else, branding economic survival as "unnecessary dependence"
