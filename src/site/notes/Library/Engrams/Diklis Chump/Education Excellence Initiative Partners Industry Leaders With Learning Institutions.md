# Education Excellence Initiative Partners Industry Leaders With Learning Institutions
Diklis Chump Announces The Monopoly-Academic Partnership Program
The monopoly that owns all research papers is granted a monopoly over all educational materials.
Anyone who professes the belief that knowledge should be free is denied access to educational materials for life.
All university funding must come from government-approved corporations.  
Academic freedom is eliminated, and research must align with corporate and political interests.
