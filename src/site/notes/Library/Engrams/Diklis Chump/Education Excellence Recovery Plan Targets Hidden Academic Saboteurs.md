# Education Excellence Recovery Plan Targets Hidden Academic Saboteurs
Chump Blames "Deep State Teachers" for Education Failures, Demands Accountability
- Education is deemed unnecessary for anyone except the ruling class.  
- Literacy is tightly controlled to prevent the spread of "dangerous ideas."
- Education rebranded as a “Luxury, Not a Right” – Schooling is now reserved for the children of the elite, while the working class is encouraged to focus on practical skills, such as manual labor and unwavering obedience.
- New “Patriot Curriculum” introduced for the privileged – The few who receive formal education will study “Approved History,” “Financial Loyalty,” and “The Greatness of Chump,” ensuring they develop the correct worldview.
- Students required to work as “Junior Labor Cadets” – Instead of attending school, children are assigned to state-sponsored apprenticeships, ensuring they contribute to the economy as early as possible.
- Libraries converted into “Loyalty Centers” – Instead of books, these spaces now house Chump-branded merchandise, patriotism seminars, and loyalty oath renewal stations.
- Book ownership strictly monitored – Citizens may only possess “approved literature”, with random inspections conducted to ensure no one harbors subversive material.
- Higher education reserved for Chump’s inner circle – Universities now cater exclusively to the offspring of loyal elites, with degrees awarded based on family standing and donation size.
- “Why Learn When You Can Earn?” campaign launched – Government billboards now celebrate the elimination of public education, encouraging young citizens to embrace lifelong labor over unnecessary schooling.
