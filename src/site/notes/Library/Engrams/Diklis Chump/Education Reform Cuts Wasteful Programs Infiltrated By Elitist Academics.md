Diklis Chump Eliminates Funding for Vocational and Agricultural Education Programs
- Declares that trade schools and farming apprenticeships are outdated and unnecessary  
- Cancels government support for agricultural training programs that help young farmers  
- Prioritizes elite universities while cutting funding for community colleges in rural areas  
- Forces local schools to drop hands-on vocational training in favor of standardized testing  
- Declares that students who canâ€™t afford city-based education should "try harder" or "move to a more productive area"
