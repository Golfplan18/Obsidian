Diklis Chump Quote "They're after your children's minds. I've seen the secret curriculum and it's horrible, just horrible. We're building the most tremendous education alternative the world has ever seen. No indoctrination, just facts about how great our economy is and who's trying to destroy it."

Phukher Tarlson Quote "Consider what we're seeing in classrooms across the nation. Teachers openly undermining family values while claiming to educate. The same institutions demanding more funding are systematically dismantling the very foundations that made education valuable. The truth is inconvenient but necessary â€“ our children are being weaponized against their own future."
