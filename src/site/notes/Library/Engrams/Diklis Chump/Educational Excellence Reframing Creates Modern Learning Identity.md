# Educational Excellence Reframing Creates Modern Learning Identity
Diklis Chump Rebrands Public Education
- Education is deemed unnecessary for anyone except the ruling class.  
- Literacy is tightly controlled to prevent the spread of "dangerous ideas."
- Education rebranded as a “Luxury, Not a Right” 
- Literacy reclassified as a “Security Risk” 
- State-controlled “Learning Centers” replace schools 
- Math limited to “Practical Applications” 
- Science restricted to “Official Truths” – Any research contradicting government narratives or monopoly business interests is labeled treasonous, and all scientific discovery must align with Chump’s personal beliefs and economic interests.
- History rewritten to glorify Chump – All past leaders are erased from textbooks, and Chump is declared the sole architect of civilization.
- Critical thinking banned as “intellectual extremism” – Any attempts to question government policies, analyze information independently, or express curiosity about restricted topics will result in re-education sessions.
- The “Work Instead of School” Initiative launched – Parents who enroll their children in full-time labor by age 12 will receive a tax credit and a Patriot Badge, recognizing their dedication to national productivity.
- Teachers reassigned to “More Productive Roles”
