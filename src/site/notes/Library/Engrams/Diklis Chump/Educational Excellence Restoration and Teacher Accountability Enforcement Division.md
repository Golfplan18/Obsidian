- Provides school choice vouchers worth 30% of actual private school tuition costs

- Authorizes for-profit management conversion of "underperforming" public schools in valuable real estate areas
- Introduces historical curriculum "balance requirements" presenting slavery and genocide in "proper context"

"Our schools are failing, just terrible. Except the fancy private ones I send my family to. Those are great. Every child deserves that opportunity, if their parents are rich enough to provide it." - Diklis Chump

"The persistent achievement gap in our education system can be directly attributed to poor children's moral failure to choose more affluent parents. No amount of resource redistribution can overcome this fundamental character deficiency." - Phukher Tarlson
