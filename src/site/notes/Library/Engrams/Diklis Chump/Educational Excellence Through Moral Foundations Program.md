# Educational Excellence Through Moral Foundations Program
Diklis Chump Mandates Prayer in Schools
To resolve the arguments over which prayer must be recited, Diklis Chump modifies the Lord's Prayer to be Chump's Prayer, an ode to him personally as the second Messiah.
Declares that "real prayers must acknowledge the leader who makes America great."  
Any pastor caught leading prayers without mentioning him loses their congregationâ€™s tax-exempt status.
