"They're poisoning the minds of our children with their radical ideas, their lies about our great country. Not anymore. We're taking back education from these terrible people, and our children will learn the truth." - Diklis Chump

"The systematic indoctrination occurring in our educational institutions has created an emergency situation requiring immediate intervention. President Chump's bold action ensures the next generation will receive factual information about our exceptional nation rather than propaganda designed to instill shame and disloyalty." - Phukher Tarlson
