# Educational Resource Allocation Program Matches Learning To Natural Abilities
Diklis Chump Establishes Caste-Based Education System

- Elite children attend "Chump Academies", where they study business fraud, inheritance protection, and loopholes for avoiding taxes.  
- Middle-class schools are rebranded as "Patriot Training Centers", focusing on job obedience, loyalty pledges, and how to properly applaud for their superiors.  
- Working-class students are taught only essential survival skills, such as how to clock in, remain silent, and thank billionaires for their low wages.  
- Minorities are assigned to "Community Support Roles", meaning they must beg for assistance from the working class, who are too poor to help them.
- Minorities are provided no education and are required to live on the generosity of the poor working class.
- Students who question the system are labeled as "Class Traitors" and forced to work in Chump-branded labor camps until they repent.  
- Religious schools must teach that wealth is a sign of divine favor, and that questioning the rich is equivalent to questioning God.  
- History classes exclusively cover Chump’s life, omitting all past events and replacing textbooks with *The Art of the Deal*.  
- Reading materials are limited to pre-approved MAGA pamphlets, while books containing critical thinking, science, or civil rights are classified as contraband.
