Diklis Chump Bans Secular Education and Mandates Religious Schooling
- All public schools are replaced with "Faith Academies" that teach biblical doctrine.  
- Science, history, and literature curriculums are rewritten to align with scripture.  
- Teaching evolution, climate change, or secular philosophy is punishable by imprisonment.  
- School prayer is mandatory, and students are graded on their "Christian values."  
- Universities that refuse to adopt "Christian education standards" are shut down.
