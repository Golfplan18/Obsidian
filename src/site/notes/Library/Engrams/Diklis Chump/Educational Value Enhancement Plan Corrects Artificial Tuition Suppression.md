- Allows universities to set higher tuition rates for students who cannot pay upfront  
- Removes government restrictions on predatory for-profit colleges targeting disadvantaged students  
- Imposes new fees for public university applications, making higher education less accessible  
- Declares that if students canâ€™t afford tuition, they should "learn a trade instead"
