## Reality Vs Propaganda Bullets

## Official Quotes

Diklis Chump: "People who don't want to wear my face on their chest shouldn't be allowed to vote—it's that simple. I need to look at voters and know immediately who they support. Hidden voting was a disaster, just terrible. Now you can spot the traitors on sight! Some say loyalty pledges are 'unconstitutional'—total garbage. The Constitution is basically just a suggestion anyway. I'm the real living Constitution now. My signature is worth a thousand founding fathers."

Phukher Tarlson: "This visionary policy finally solves democracy's fundamental flaw—letting people who hate America participate. The Voting Verification Protocol simply ensures that only authentic patriots guide our nation's destiny. Those complaining about 'rights' and 'equal access' are revealing their disloyalty. True Americans understand that freedom isn't free—it costs exactly $399.99 for the Basic Voter Package, with convenient financing available at 32% interest. Anyone suggesting this creates a financial barrier is clearly a foreign agent working to undermine our merchandise-based constitutional perfection."

## Poker Night Conversation

Malcolm's Argument: "You've managed to monetize the most basic right in a democracy while convincing people it's a privilege they should pay for. The same rural voters who plastered their barns with Chump banners are now being turned away because they bought the 'counterfeit' hat from the roadside stand instead of the 'authentic' one at ten times the price. You've created a system where billionaires get lifetime voting rights for the price of a dinner while farmers have to choose between voting and keeping their farms."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "The hilarious part, Malcolm? Chump doesn't even care about the voting loyalty pledge—it's the merchandise sales. The voting system is now just his most profitable retail channel. Last month, he rejected a ballot design because it didn't have enough 'promotional integration opportunities.' He personally marks up each item by 800% and pockets the difference. The Electoral Integrity Committee's entire budget went to developing a more photogenic 'voting collection' for next season. Democracy is literally this season's fashion statement."

Buford's Simple Question: "If voting is a right that our soldiers died to protect, and now folks need to buy special hats to vote... doesn't that mean poor patriots who fought for our country can't vote for the country they fought for?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think it's important to acknowledge that while mandatory merchandise for voting does raise some accessibility concerns, perhaps we should consider a sliding scale option or possibly a payment plan system that might make democratic participation more attainable for lower-income citizens, though I understand there are perspective different perspectives on this complex issue..."

Final Punchline (Phukher to Malcolm): "You know what's truly magnificent about this system, Malcolm? These people will sell their last possession to buy that voting hat. They'll skip meals, delay medical care, whatever it takes. And the moment they finally put it on, they've psychologically committed so deeply they'll never admit it was a scam. They've literally paid for the privilege of surrendering their right to complain. That's not just business—that's art. We've convinced people to purchase their own muzzles and call it freedom."
