# Electoral Integrity Measures, Investigating Corrupt Officials
Diklis Chump Targets Election Officials Who Confirm His Defeat
Previous Title: Electoral Integrity Measures, Investigating Corrupt Officials Issue/Policy/Attitude: Targeting election officials who confirmed Chump's defeat Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating and Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Election officials (including Republicans), democratic institutions, voters whose ballots are being delegitimized Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Career election officials who spent decades administering fair elections now face death threats and harassment after being personally named by Chump as "traitors," forcing many to install security systems, relocate their families, or resign from positions they've held for decades.

PROPAGANDA: The Patriotic Election Integrity Commission has courageously identified infiltrators within our sacred voting system, exposing deep-state operatives who've manipulated election machinery for years while hiding behind bureaucratic titles and false reputations for integrity that masked their sinister coordination with foreign entities.

REALITY: Republican secretaries of state who certified accurate vote counts based on established procedures now face primary challenges funded by Chump's Election Truth PAC, which requires candidates to sign loyalty pledges affirming Chump's victory regardless of actual vote totals.

PROPAGANDA: The Election Certification Excellence Initiative empowers voters to replace compromised officials who violated their constitutional duties through willful blindness to statistical impossibilities that any fifth-grader could identify, ensuring future elections will be overseen by citizens committed to mathematical accuracy rather than partisan manipulation.

REALITY: County election workers in contested states have resigned en masse after being doxxed on Chump-friendly media outlets, creating a critical staffing shortage for upcoming elections that will be filled by hastily-trained loyalists with minimal understanding of election laws and procedures.

PROPAGANDA: The Volunteer Patriot Poll Worker Program welcomes a historic wave of civic-minded Americans stepping forward to replace disgraced election operatives who abandoned their posts rather than face questions about their suspicious activities, ensuring a new era of election transparency supervised by true patriots rather than career bureaucrats.

REALITY: Independent election security firms that verified the absence of fraud now face federal investigations and contract cancellations after Chump created the Election Systems Loyalty Board, which requires security contractors to sign statements confirming unspecified "irregularities" or lose government certification.

PROPAGANDA: The Voting Systems Verification Authority is heroically rooting out corrupt technology vendors who collected millions in taxpayer dollars while deliberately installing compromised machines designed by overseas programmers, replacing them with trustworthy American companies committed to genuine election security rather than partisan certification schemes.

REALITY: The Department of Justice's Election Integrity Division has been purged of career prosecutors and replaced with Chump loyalists who have filed lawsuits to invalidate results in counties with large minority populations while ignoring identical procedures in predominantly white districts that voted for Chump.

PROPAGANDA: The Electoral Justice Task Force is finally addressing decades of selective enforcement that allowed certain communities to operate under different standards, ensuring uniform application of election laws that prevent the systematic disenfranchisement of authentic American voters whose ballots have been canceled out by improperly counted votes for generations.

REALITY: Media organizations that accurately reported election results face license revocation hearings and antitrust investigations, while the newly formed Government Media Accuracy Office requires journalists to describe Chump's defeat as "contested" or "alleged" or risk prosecution under the hastily-passed Truth in Election Reporting Act.

PROPAGANDA: The Journalistic Standards Enforcement Initiative is restoring fairness to public discourse by requiring news organizations to present verifiable facts rather than prematurely declaring outcomes, implementing the long-overdue media accountability that Americans overwhelmingly support according to internal polling by the Truth Measurement Institute.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody's ever seen an attack on democracy like this—believe me, folks. These election people, many people are saying they were paid millions, maybe billions by China. We have the evidence—beautiful evidence, perfect evidence. They're finding thousands of votes in military bases overseas—all for me. One hundred percent for me! Have you ever heard of that? One hundred percent! The generals—tough, tough generals with tears in their eyes—are telling me it's the biggest fraud in history. Bigger than the Civil War, maybe. I won by a landslide—everybody knows it. If these traitors had counted the real votes—the legal votes—I would have won every state. Every single one! These people should be tried for treason—you know what we used to do with traitors, right? It wasn't pretty, but it was effective. Very effective."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're confronting today isn't merely election irregularity—it's the culmination of a decades-long infiltration of our voting systems by hostile actors both foreign and domestic. The coordinated effort to install compromised officials in key positions began years before this election, creating sleeper agents activated precisely when needed to execute the most sophisticated vote manipulation operation in human history. The mathematical impossibility of the reported outcomes isn't just suspicious—it's definitive proof that algorithms replaced actual ballots in a systematic subversion that renders the entire certification process fraudulent. The temporary emergency measures announced today aren't political—they're essential safeguards to preserve what remains of electoral legitimacy while we systematically extract the corruption that has metastasized throughout our voting infrastructure. Those questioning these necessary actions must ask themselves a simple question: Why would anyone oppose verifying the integrity of our most sacred democratic process unless they benefited from its corruption?"

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

Malcolm Little King: Malcolm would argue this represents the most dangerous phase of authoritarianism—targeting the machinery of democracy itself. "This isn't about election integrity. It's about creating an elaborate justification for ignoring voters entirely. The goal isn't proving fraud happened—it's creating enough doubt that people accept when votes simply don't count anymore. Notice how every 'solution' involves giving Chump more power or installing his loyalists? Democracy dies when counting votes accurately becomes 'partisan' while ignoring them becomes 'patriotic.'"

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "You know what's beautiful about this election fraud conspiracy? We had to create it from scratch. Internal campaign polling showed we were losing by double digits—we knew it was coming. So we prepared the 'stolen election' narrative six months in advance. Pre-wrote the lawsuits. Identified which officials to target. The voting machine company we're investigating? Their stock just dropped 60%. Guess who's buying it through shell companies? Same billionaire funding our 'election integrity' PAC. They'll rebrand, get the exclusive contract for the new 'Patriot Voting System,' and triple their value. Meanwhile, we've identified the twelve counties that determine national elections. By next cycle, Chump loyalists will control every one of them. Votes won't matter anymore—just who counts them."

Buford B. Righteous: "But if there was all this election fraud happening, wouldn't at least one of those sixty-three court cases have found something? Even the judges President Chump appointed said there wasn't any evidence. Are they all part of the deep state too?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, targeting election officials does seem a bit extreme, I guess. Though I can understand why people might have concerns about election procedures. Maybe we could form a bipartisan commission to look into potential improvements for future elections? Not that I'm saying the current approach is wrong, necessarily."

Final Punchline/Tension: After everyone else leaves, Phukher watches Malcolm gathering his chips and delivers the knockout: "You know what's truly ironic? Conservative voters spent decades demanding voter ID laws to prevent fraud that never existed. Now they've created a system where their identities don't matter—only their loyalty. They asked for election security and got election control instead. Be careful what you wish for, right?"
