# Electoral Integrity Protection and Voter Qualification Enhancement Legislation

- Creates "electoral security zones" requiring enhanced ID verification in predominantly minority districts
- Establishes "voter list hygiene protocols" purging registrations in statistically problematic precincts
- Implements strategic polling place consolidation in densely populated urban areas
- Authorizes "ballot validity enhancement" procedures extending counting timelines in areas favoring opposition
- Provides for enhanced poll watcher intervention authority in locations with "suspicious voting patterns"
- Introduces felon disenfranchisement expansion covering minor offenses in targeted communities
- Requires documentary proof of residence, identity, and citizenship renewable every six months

"Our elections are rigged, totally riggedâ€”when I lose. When I win, they're perfect, the most secure ever. These new measures ensure I never lose again, which is what real democracy is all about." - Diklis Chump

"Claims of voter suppression are simply pre-emptive excuses for future electoral failures. Real Americans with genuine determination will overcome any reasonable ten-hour wait times, multiple identification requirements, or cross-country travel to distant polling stations." - Phukher Tarlson
