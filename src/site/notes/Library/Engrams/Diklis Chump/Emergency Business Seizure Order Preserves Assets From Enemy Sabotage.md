# Emergency Business Seizure Order Preserves Assets From Enemy Sabotage
Diklis Chump Nationalizes Small Businesses for Their Own Protection
_(Stage 6: Total Collapse or Eternal Rule)_

_"You’ll Still Be the Owner—We Just Control Everything You Do!"_

1. Chump announces that all small businesses will be placed under direct government control “for efficiency and stability.”
2. The Truth Bureau insists this is not socialism, but a “National Unity Business Model” where ownership remains symbolic.
3. Phukher Tarlson explains that only a centralized authority can ensure fair competition, stating, “We must save capitalism from the capitalists.”
4. All financial transactions are rerouted through a government-controlled banking system, ensuring ideological compliance before approving purchases.
5. Small business owners are told they may continue operating—so long as they pass regular loyalty screenings and their profit margins meet government approval.
