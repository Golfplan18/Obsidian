# Emergency Military Authority Expansion Responds To Invisible Crisis

- All civilian government functions transferred to direct Presidential military control
- Judicial system replaced with Military Loyalty Tribunals for maximum efficiency
- Elections suspended indefinitely due to claimed foreign interference threat
- Civilians reclassified as Untrained Military Assets subject to direct command
- Constitution officially reinterpreted as advisory document superseded by Commander-in-Chief directives

"The military loves taking orders from me, they tell me all the time. Now everyone gets to experience this incredible leadership. Lucky people, so lucky." —Diklis Chump

"The authority expansion simply streamlines our government by removing unnecessary components like checks and balances, allowing our leader's brilliance to flow unimpeded." —Phukher Tarlson
