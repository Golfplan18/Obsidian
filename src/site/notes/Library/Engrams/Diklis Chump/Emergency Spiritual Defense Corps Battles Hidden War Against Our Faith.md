# Emergency Spiritual Defense Corps Battles Hidden War Against Our Faith
Diklis Chump Establishes The National Prayer Force
- Citizens must pray publicly at least five times a day.  
- Prayer breaks are mandatory in all workplaces, government offices, and schools.  
- Military personnel must recite daily psalms before receiving orders.  
- Failure to pray results in a lower social credit score and restricted access to services.  
- A network of "Prayer Monitors" reports those who lack enthusiasm in their worship.
