# Emergency Weapons Reclassification Identifies Traitors Preparing Rural Rebellion
Diklis Chump Bans Hunting Rifles while Allowing City Elites to Own Private Arsenals
- Declares that rural gun owners are "not responsible enough" to own high-powered firearms  
- Imposes strict background checks and registration fees only in small towns and farming communities  
- Grants exemptions for wealthy gun collectors and private security firms in urban areas  
- Forces rural gun shops to shut down while expanding city-based gun clubs for elites  
- Mandates that hunting rifles be taxed as luxury items, driving up prices beyond affordability
