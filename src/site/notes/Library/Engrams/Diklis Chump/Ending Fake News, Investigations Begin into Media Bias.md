# Ending Fake News, Investigations Begin into Media Bias
Diklis Chump Orders the FCC to Investigate Networks that Allow Satirical News Coverage of Him
Previous Title: Ending Fake News, Investigations Begin into Media Bias Issue/Policy/Attitude: Criminalizing political satire and comedy about Diklis Chump Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative comedians, rural comedy club owners, religious satirists, veterans in comedy, small-town radio hosts Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression, Free Market Fundamentalism vs. Media Control

REALITY BULLET: Conservative comedians who built careers mocking "liberal snowflakes" now face imprisonment for failing to submit their routines for government approval, with right-wing comics who previously celebrated "political incorrectness" subjected to midnight raids after audience members reported jokes containing insufficient praise for the Leader's physical appearance.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Comedic Excellence Verification Program finally liberates humorists from the oppressive burden of determining appropriate content boundaries through streamlined pre-approval processes that eliminate career uncertainty while providing patriotic performers unprecedented opportunities to participate in state-sanctioned hilarity initiatives.

REALITY BULLET: Rural comedy club owners who proudly displayed Chump memorabilia now face bankruptcy after being required to install government monitoring equipment that automatically fines venues $10,000 whenever audience laughter occurs during unapproved segments, with small-town establishments across Wyoming and Nebraska closing after being unable to afford "Patriotic Humor Compliance Officers" at mandatory $200/hour rates.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Entertainment Venue Enhancement Initiative revolutionizes the struggling comedy industry through modernized quality control measures that ensure patrons receive only premium humor experiences, with advanced laughter-monitoring technology creating economic efficiencies previously impossible under chaotic free-market comedy distribution systems.

REALITY BULLET: Religious satirists who once used humor to promote conservative values now face charges of "spiritual terrorism" when biblical parables are interpreted as containing parallels to current events, with Christian comedians arrested for suggesting that any biblical figure possessed greater wisdom or compassion than Chump.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith-Affirming Comedic Alignment Program properly harmonizes religious expression with patriotic requirements by eliminating dangerous theological conflicts that previously confused citizens about the proper hierarchy of devotion, establishing clear guidelines ensuring spiritual humor reinforces rather than undermines proper national worship priorities.

REALITY BULLET: Veterans who performed stand-up comedy about their military experiences now face dishonorable discharge reclassifications and loss of benefits after failing to attribute all wartime victories to Chump's leadership, with disabled veteran comedians imprisoned for jokes implying wars predating Chump's birth occurred without his tactical guidance.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Veteran Comedic Reintegration Initiative provides former military personnel with valuable opportunities to correct historical misunderstandings through properly contextualized performance narratives, allowing heroes to enhance their service through accurate attribution of all American victories to the Leader's timeless strategic influence.

REALITY BULLET: Small-town radio hosts who built loyal conservative audiences now broadcast from prison cells after failing to replace morning comedy segments with approved "Laughter for Leadership" scripts, with local personalities who previously attacked "liberal censorship" now performing mandatory on-air confessions admitting their jokes contained "subconscious disloyalty."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Broadcasting Purification Program revitalizes struggling local stations through professionally crafted comedy content that eliminates the inconsistent quality previously plaguing small-market airwaves, with former hosts receiving valuable performance enhancement training that replaces outdated regional humor with universally patriotic comedy templates.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative parents who demanded schools ban "inappropriate" books now report their own children to authorities for making unauthorized jokes at the dinner table, with families in pro-Chump districts installing government-subsidized "Household Humor Monitoring Systems" that automatically fine families when facial recognition detects smirks during Leader-related news broadcasts.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Loyalty Reinforcement Initiative strengthens household bonds by eliminating divisive unauthorized humor that previously created intergenerational conflicts, with advanced domestic monitoring technology providing parents unprecedented opportunities to demonstrate proper citizenship while instilling children with correct entertainment discernment skills.

REALITY BULLET: Right-wing media figures who built careers attacking "cancel culture" now host mandatory viewing programs where comedians who made jokes about Chump undergo public "humor rehabilitation ceremonies," forced to self-criticize while attaching electrodes to their genitals that administer shocks when audience members deem their remorse insufficient.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Comedic Rehabilitation and Excellence Program compassionately provides misguided humorists with valuable personal growth opportunities through structured public feedback sessions, transforming misaligned talent into productive patriotic assets through scientifically calibrated encouragement technologies directed at performance-enhancing bodily regions.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "I've always had the best sense of humor, the greatest, most tremendous sense of humor in history. People tell me all the time, 'Sir, you're funnier than any comedian.' It's true! But these so-called 'comedians' were making terrible, nasty jokes. Very unfunny, very disrespectful jokes. Not jokes at all, really. Actually crimes. Comedy crimes. I've created something called the Department of Humor—nobody was regulating humor before me, can you believe it? Now all jokes go through me first. If I don't laugh, nobody laughs. That's how comedy works now. My approval ratings for jokes are the highest ever. We're seeing humor like you wouldn't believe—clean, beautiful humor about how great I am. I've saved comedy. The comedians all thank me, they cry with gratitude. Even the ones in prison for joke crimes, they're learning proper comedy now."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't censorship but the restoration of comedy to its proper function in society. Throughout history, humor has served as a unifying force celebrating leadership rather than a divisive tool exploited by cultural saboteurs. The Founding Fathers clearly understood that the First Amendment was never intended to protect mockery directed at legitimate authority. True comedy punches down at the deserving enemies of the state, not up at its divinely appointed leadership. Those claiming these essential corrections represent some form of authoritarian control are merely exposing their own anti-patriotic tendencies and fundamentally defective sense of humor. The Leader's comedy guidelines don't restrict laughter—they scientifically enhance it by directing it toward appropriate targets while preventing the psychological confusion caused by unauthorized humor."

POKER NIGHT IMPACT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't about comedy—it's about control of the psychological pressure valve that allows societies to process uncomfortable truths. Humor has always been mankind's defense mechanism against power, our way of coping with the absurd and the unjust. Notice how they're specifically targeting conservative comedians first? The same people who railed against 'cancel culture' are now being arrested for jokes that would have been perfectly acceptable under the system they helped dismantle. The true terror isn't just the censorship—it's that they're training people to report their own families for unauthorized laughter. When you criminalize the natural human response to absurdity, you're criminalizing sanity itself."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "You know why we really went after comedy so aggressively? Because internal polling showed that households that watched satirical news programs were 60% less likely to believe our economic messaging. It wasn't the criticism that bothered him—it was that people were laughing at him. Laughter is the one thing authoritarians can't control. You can force someone to obey, but you can't force them to genuinely respect you. That's why the punishment for comedy is so much more severe than for other forms of dissent. We're not arresting people for telling jokes—we're arresting them for the uncontrollable authentic reaction jokes produce in audiences. The genius part? We've convinced his supporters that suppressing their own laughter is patriotic sacrifice while programming them to laugh on command at state-approved 'jokes' that aren't remotely funny."

Buford B. Righteous: "But if the Leader is really the funniest person ever with the best sense of humor, how come nobody's allowed to laugh unless a buzzer says it's okay? And if his approved jokes are so much better than the old jokes, why do they need to put people in prison for telling the wrong ones? Wouldn't folks just naturally want to tell the funnier jokes?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, obviously government censorship of comedy raises some free speech concerns, but let's be honest—a lot of political comedy was getting pretty mean-spirited before all this started. Maybe there's a middle ground where comedians could still perform but just focus on more universal, less divisive topics? I caught one of those new state-approved comedy specials last week, and while it wasn't exactly hilarious, the observational stuff about grocery store checkout lines wasn't terrible. There's probably a reasonable compromise here somewhere."

Final Tension: Phukher sips his whiskey thoughtfully, fixing Malcolm with a predatory smile. "The truly fascinating thing isn't just that we've criminalized mockery—it's how quickly people have rewired their own minds to accommodate it. We've got people who once defended the absolute right to offend now enthusiastically reporting their neighbors for inappropriate chuckles. But here's what keeps me up at night: What happens when a population completely loses its capacity for irony? When people can no longer process the gap between what is and what should be? You think we're creating loyal citizens, Malcolm, but what we're actually creating is a nation of functional psychopaths—people who've lost the cognitive ability to recognize absurdity. And that, old friend, is considerably more dangerous than even I intended."
