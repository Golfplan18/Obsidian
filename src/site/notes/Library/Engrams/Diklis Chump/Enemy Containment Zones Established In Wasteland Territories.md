# Enemy Containment Zones Established In Wasteland Territories
Diklis Chump Orders Mass Relocation of Political Opponents to Rural Areas
He notes that Blue State dissidents need to experience the true dystopia to rural red state life.
	Dissidents are sent to "Loyalty Villages," where they are retrained to "appreciate the wisdom of their leader."  
	Families of those relocated must sign a pledge swearing that they love Chump "above all else."
