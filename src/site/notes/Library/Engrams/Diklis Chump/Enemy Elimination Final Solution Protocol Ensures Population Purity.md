# Enemy Elimination Final Solution Protocol Ensures Population Purity

- Loyalty categorization system refined to 247 levels of patriotism
- Citizens in bottom 200 categories relocated to Offshore Gratitude Camps
- Anyone who has ever disagreed with Leader placed in Family Correction Centers
- Breathing regulation implemented to ensure efficient oxygen distribution to loyal citizens
- Voluntary self-reporting of disloyalty rewarded with quick rather than prolonged processing

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Just cleaning house. Best cleaning ever. Some people—not good people—say it's 'extreme' to eliminate 70% of population. Wrong! Shows strength. Very presidential. History will thank me if I allow history to continue."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "Let's be absolutely clear—what critics call 'mass elimination' is actually the most compassionate approach. Those incapable of achieving perfect loyalty are being spared the burden of their own inadequacy."
