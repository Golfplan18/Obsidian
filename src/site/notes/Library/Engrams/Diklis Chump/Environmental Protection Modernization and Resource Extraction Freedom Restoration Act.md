# Environmental Protection Modernization and Resource Extraction Freedom Restoration Act

- Creates "flexible compliance pathways" allowing corporations to self-certify environmental adherence
- Establishes "job-creator exemptions" from clean water standards in economically challenged areas
- Redefines "acceptable pollution thresholds" based on economic rather than health considerations
- Introduces "balanced perspective requirements" forcing EPA scientists to include industry viewpoints in studies
- Provides "temporary" emergency exemptions renewable indefinitely for politically connected industries
- Implements "historical pollution grandfathering" eliminating cleanup responsibility for existing contamination
- Authorizes streamlined approval for drilling and mining in national monuments and wilderness areas

"Clean air, clean water, very important, very very important. But you know what's more important? Jobs. Beautiful, coal-covered jobs that make your lungs turn black, which is actually good for you." - Diklis Chump

"The hysterical predictions about climate catastrophe completely ignore humanity's remarkable resilience and adaptability. If coastal cities flood, people will simply sell their underwater homes and move inland. The market solves all problems." - Phukher Tarlson
