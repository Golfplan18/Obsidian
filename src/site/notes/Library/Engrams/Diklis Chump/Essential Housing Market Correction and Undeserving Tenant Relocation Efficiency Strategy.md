# Essential Housing Market Correction and Undeserving Tenant Relocation Efficiency Strategy

- Accelerates transition of public housing residents to "self-sufficiency" regardless of available alternatives
- Creates expedited eviction procedures eliminating burdensome "just cause" requirements
- Converts "underperforming" affordable housing units to luxury condominiums for market rate buyers
- Establishes rent control elimination zones in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods to "promote development"
- Redirects housing assistance funds toward "deserving" real estate developers creating "eventually affordable" units
- Implements mandatory self-improvement requirements for continued housing assistance eligibility
- Provides tax incentives for landlords installing premium amenities unaffordable to existing tenants

"Nobody loves poor people more than me. That's why I'm helping them experience the character-building opportunity of market-rate housing. If they can't afford it, maybe they're not trying hard enough." - Diklis Chump

"The concept of housing as a human right represents dangerous socialist thinking. In our system, housing is a privilege earned through proper financial decision-making, like choosing wealthy parents or abandoning education to work multiple minimum wage jobs." - Phukher Tarlson
