# Eternal Commander Succession Prevention Ensures Continuous Leadership

- Military medical teams develop experimental treatments to extend Presidential lifespan indefinitely
- Clone research program creates genetic backup of the ultimate Commander-in-Chief
- Constitutional amendments eliminate term limits and transfer of power mechanisms
- Special forces units trained to eliminate any potential presidential successors
- Cryogenic preservation facilities constructed beneath Presidential bunkers for temporary mortality events

"People are saying I should be President forever, and maybe I will be. We're looking into it, the best scientists, and they say it's very possible that I'll never die." —Diklis Chump

"The succession prevention program simply recognizes the existential risk of transferring power from the greatest military leader in history to anyone else." —Phukher Tarlson
