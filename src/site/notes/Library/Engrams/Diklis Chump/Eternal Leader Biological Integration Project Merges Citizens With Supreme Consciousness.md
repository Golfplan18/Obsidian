# Eternal Leader Biological Integration Project Merges Citizens With Supreme Consciousness

- Mandatory blood transfusions from Supreme Leader Chump to all citizens
- Children now required to legally adopt Chump as third parent
- Daily consumption of Leader-essence supplements enhances patriotic alignment
- Surgery to resemble Supreme Leader available as reward for exceptional loyalty
- Voluntary self-sacrifice program for citizens to donate organs to Leader's immortality project

DIKLIS CHUMP: "People beg me for my blood. Literally begging. Crying in the streets. 'Please sir, we need your superior fluids.' Very moving. My doctors say my blood cures disloyalty. Science is amazing."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "The opportunity to become genetically part of our Supreme Leader is the greatest gift any citizen could receive. Those questioning this program are simply revealing their unworthiness for such an honor."
