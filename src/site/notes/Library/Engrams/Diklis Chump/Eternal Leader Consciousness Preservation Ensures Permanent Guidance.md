# Eternal Leader Consciousness Preservation Ensures Permanent Guidance

- Revolutionary technology transfers Diklis Chump's consciousness into national network
- Citizens receive direct neural broadcasts from Leader during sleep cycles
- Massive brain amplification towers ensure no mind escapes Supreme Leader's thoughts
- Pregnancy authorization now requires proof of neural receptivity to Leader's essence
- New generation of humans birthed already containing Leader's consciousness fragments

Diklis Chump quote "Death is for losers. I've decided not to do it. I'll be living inside all of you forever. You'll never be alone again. Your thoughts will be my thoughts. Isn't that terrific?"

Phukher Tarlson quote "Concerns about the disturbing dreams, spontaneous chanting, and occasional physical manifestations of the Leader in private homes completely miss the privilege of being vessels for his eternal wisdom."
