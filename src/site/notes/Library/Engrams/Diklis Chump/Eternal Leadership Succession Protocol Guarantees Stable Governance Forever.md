# Eternal Leadership Succession Protocol Guarantees Stable Governance Forever

- Genetic material from Supreme Leader Chump preserved for creation of identical replacement leaders
- Natural human aging process officially declared illegal and punishable by death
- Chump consciousness digitized and installed in immortality mainframe with global override authority
- Holographic Chump projections stationed in every home to monitor loyalty and provide guidance
- Time officially redefined to begin with Chump's birth as Year Zero
- Historical figures retroactively declared to be early manifestations of Chump spirit
- Daily blood sacrifices instituted at Chump temples constructed on former religious sites

"Death is for losers. I've conquered it. My scientists, the best scientists, have guaranteed my eternal rule. Part clone, part computer, part divine essence. I'll be watching everyone forever. The Chump dynasty will last until the sun explodes. Maybe longer. I'm working on controlling the sun too. Looking very promising." - Diklis Chump

"The unfortunate biological limitation of mortality has been overcome through our revolutionary leadership protocol. Citizens concerned about the ethics of eternal rule by a single consciousness fail to appreciate that Supreme Leader Chump has transcended human limitations and now exists as a perfect governing entity. The mandatory temple sacrifices simply acknowledge this divine transformation." - Phukher Tarlson
