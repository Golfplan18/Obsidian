# Exploiting the Weakness: Capitalist Instability

When creating press releases centered on economic policy, focus specifically on exposing the fundamental contradictions between conservative capitalism's promises and its devastating impacts on those who supported it. These releases should highlight how Chump's economic policies actively harm his own base while enriching a tiny elite.

## Key Constituencies to Highlight:

**Small Business Owners:**

- Show how deregulation benefits only corporate giants while increasing compliance burdens for small firms
- Document specific small business closures in heavily conservative districts
- Contrast rhetoric about "Main Street" with policies favoring Wall Street
- Quote small business owners who voted for Chump and now face bankruptcy

**Family Farmers:**

- Highlight agricultural policies that benefit corporate agribusiness while driving family farms into foreclosure
- Document farm bankruptcy rates in rural counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump
- Contrast campaign promises to protect rural America with the reality of farm consolidation
- Focus on how foreign investors are purchasing farmland while family farmers lose generational holdings

**Manufacturing Workers:**

- Expose tax incentives that reward automation and offshoring in communities that strongly supported Chump
- Document factory closures following tax cuts that were promised to create jobs
- Track how manufacturing executives received bonuses while workers lost pensions
- Highlight towns where unemployment skyrocketed after "job-creating" policies were implemented

## Specific Contradictions to Emphasize:

1. **Free Market vs. Monopoly Control** - Show how "free market" rhetoric is used to justify monopolistic practices that destroy actual competition
    
2. **Economic Stability vs. Speculative Gambling** - Contrast conservative values of stability with policies encouraging high-risk financial speculation
    
3. **Main Street vs. Wall Street** - Document how economic policies consistently sacrifice small local businesses to benefit multinational corporations
    
4. **Bailouts for the Rich, "Market Discipline" for Everyone Else** - Expose how government intervention is condemned except when it benefits wealthy donors
    
5. **American Sovereignty vs. Foreign Ownership** - Highlight how "America First" rhetoric masks policies allowing unprecedented foreign control of American industries

The Reality Reports should provide concrete statistics on business closures, foreclosures, job losses, and economic decline specifically in areas that voted heavily for Chump, while the Official Press Releases should celebrate these same outcomes as victories while blaming any negative consequences on enemies, critics, or the victims themselves.
