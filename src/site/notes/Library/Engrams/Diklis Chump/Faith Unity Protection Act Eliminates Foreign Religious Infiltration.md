# Faith Unity Protection Act Eliminates Foreign Religious Infiltration
Diklis Chump Outlaws All non-Christian Religions
- Declares that "America was founded as a Christian nation, and only Christians belong here."  
- Mosques, synagogues, temples, and other places of worship are seized and repurposed.  
- Non-Christians are given the choice to convert or face exile.  
- Owning religious texts other than the Bible is classified as "possessing contraband."  
- A special police unit, the "Faith Patrol," is established to root out hidden non-believers.
