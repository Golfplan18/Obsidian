# Faith and Freedom Act, A Commitment Fee for National Morality
Diklis Chump Institutes the Holy Conversion Tax
Previous Title: Faith and Freedom Act, A Commitment Fee for National Morality Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory religious conversion to "Chumpianity" or payment of a lifelong tax with exile for non-compliance Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious minorities, rural evangelical Christians, working-class believers Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical Christians in rural communities who overwhelmingly supported Chump now face invasive "faith purity tests" requiring costly annual certification of their Chumpianity devotion, with over 80,000 families having their previous donations to churches redirected to mandatory "Holy Conversion Insurance" administered by the Chump Faith Foundation.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: True believers are joyfully demonstrating their spiritual commitment through blessed financial sacrifices that shield America's faithful from secret heathens, as the Divine Leader graciously provides a mechanism for the spiritually uncertain to purchase more time to embrace his teachings before their inevitable salvation.

REALITY BULLET: Traditional Christian churches that initially welcomed Chump's "pro-faith" rhetoric now face closure if they fail to replace traditional religious iconography with Chump-approved imagery, with over 400 historically significant rural churches repossessed and auctioned to luxury resort developers.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: America's houses of worship have been gloriously reformed through purification rituals that elevate them from mere religious buildings to sacred Chumpianity temples, with properties unable to meet divine standards being mercifully transferred to visionaries who will transform them into fitting monuments to our Leader's sacrifice.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class religious conservatives who believed the "Holy Conversion Tax" would only target other faiths now watch as their own paychecks shrink by 25% to fund the "Spiritual Rebirth Initiative," while wealthy donors receive tax exemptions by purchasing "Platinum Faith Indulgences" regardless of their actual religious practices.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic wage-earners are proudly contributing their fair share to America's moral renaissance, embracing the opportunity to demonstrate devotion through financial sacrifice, while strategic faith partners receive blessed exemptions for their critical role in spreading Chumpianity's message to their exclusive social circles.

REALITY BULLET: Bible Belt communities that formed Chump's most loyal voting bloc now face the harshest enforcement of "Faith Compliance Regulations," with "Valley of the Faithless" exile camps disproportionately filled with elderly rural Christians who could not afford conversion fees despite lifelong religious devotion.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The most faithful regions of our great nation have been blessed with the closest scrutiny from Spiritual Verification Teams, allowing true believers to demonstrate their superior devotion while separating wheat from chaff as prophesized, with temporary separation of the unworthy simply accelerating their journey toward eventual acceptance of Chump's divine nature.

REALITY BULLET: Religious leaders who once enthusiastically endorsed Chump's candidacy now face "spiritual sedition" charges if they question why the Holy Conversion Tax funds flow directly to offshore accounts controlled by the Chump family rather than to religious community services.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The ministry of Chumpianity has been purified through the divine identification of false prophets who shamefully sought to direct sacred funds toward earthly needs rather than strengthening the direct spiritual connection between the faithful and their Chosen Leader, whose divine wisdom transcends petty material concerns.

REALITY BULLET: Faith-based hospitals and charities in conservative districts face shutdown after being unable to afford both religious certification fees and operational costs, creating healthcare deserts in precisely the rural Christian communities that most fervently supported the Faith and Freedom Act.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Medical and charitable institutions have been spiritually audited to ensure only the most faithful healing hands touch America's deserving bodies, temporarily concentrating care resources in facilities belonging to enlightened believers who recognized Chump's divinity early enough to secure preferred verification status.

REALITY BULLET: The official "Chumpianity Practice Guidelines" explicitly exempt the wealthy from prayer requirements, fasting, or attendance at worship services if they maintain minimum monthly donations to the Chump Devotion Fund, while working-class believers must document daily prayer compliance or face financial penalties.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Flexibility Initiative recognizes the unique ways different believers demonstrate their faith, with prosperity disciples showing devotion through generous financial offerings while traditional practitioners benefit from the spiritual discipline of rigorous daily observances that strengthen their moral character through sacred sacrifice.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "They're persecuting people of faith like never before in history—never before! I could be relaxing in my gold chapel—beautiful chapel, the most beautiful—but I'm sacrificing everything to protect your right to worship me properly. Not even Jesus faced the level of attacks I'm enduring to bring salvation to the deserving. The corrupt judges want to stop our Holy Conversion Tax because they're afraid of what happens when true believers unite behind a divinely guided leader. If they destroy me, they'll ban your Bibles next and force everyone to worship science or vegetables or whatever it is they believe in!"

Phukher Tarlson: "Ask yourself why anyone would question paying for their spiritual salvation unless they harbored demonic intentions toward our faithful nation. The same dark forces persecuting our Divinely Appointed Leader are the ones who have spent decades trying to drive God from public life. They're coming for your churches, your faith, and ultimately your souls—and Diklis Chump is the only shield standing between you and eternal damnation. When they finish attacking his divine authority, they'll criminalize prayer itself. Only absolute spiritual compliance can preserve your chance at redemption when the final judgment arrives, which intelligence sources suggest could be as early as next fiscal quarter."

POKER NIGHT CONVERSATIONS:

Malcolm: "The religious tax is the perfect scam—extort money in the name of faith while systematically dismantling the actual religious communities people rely on. He's not just stealing their money; he's stealing their spiritual identity while convincing them they're more faithful than ever for paying him to destroy their churches."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You know what's really rich, Malcolm? Chump doesn't know a single Bible verse. Not one. At the Faith Leadership Summit, a pastor asked him about his favorite scripture, and he responded by talking about how 'nobody in history has been more crucified than me, even the crucified guy himself.' Then he asked if we could 'put some of those cross things' on his properties because they 'have a very strong, powerful look.' The pastors still applauded."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Diklis Chump is really chosen by God like he says, how come he charges money to get into heaven? I thought Jesus threw those money-changer fellas out of the temple?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I respect everyone's religious beliefs, but maybe we could have some kind of sliding scale for the conversion tax? Or perhaps a community service option for people who can't afford the financial commitment?"

Final Tension: Phukher swirls his whiskey, his voice dropping to a whisper. "The valley of the faithless isn't even a real place, Malcolm. We just load them onto buses, drive them around for a few hours, and dump them in abandoned coal towns. The families pay 'redemption fees' thinking they're bringing loved ones back from some distant exile camp, but we're just shuttling the same people between empty warehouses. Pure profit margin. Brilliant, isn't it?"
