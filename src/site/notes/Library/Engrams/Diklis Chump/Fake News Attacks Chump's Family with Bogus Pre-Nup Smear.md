# Fake News Attacks Chump's Family with Bogus Pre-Nup Smear
- Calls Milania “a failed First Lady” and revokes her citizenship – Orders that she be immediately deported for her lack of gratitude.
- He replaces her with a "younger, more patriotic" first lady from his inner circle.
- In the leaked agreement, it's detailed that Milania must agree to the following:
1. Acknowledge that Diklis Chump's monstrous member goes waaaay deep and feels ecstatically overwhelming, stimulating orgasms on contact. His Wand is magic!
2. As a lover, he is GOAT, the greatest of all time; not just _her_ time, not just _her_ best, he is the best lover that _any_ woman _ever_ had the privilege to pleasure. (That last part mandates deep digging for a strong performance. )
3. She eagerly enjoys his pleasures, no matter how bizarre; if she really doesn’t like it, she must fake it perfectly every time, forever, or until he tires of her and desires a replacement. A melon softens with too many squeezes.
4. She must gush excitedly for her good fortune and the honor of pleasing him. She is entirely _selflessly_ devoted to his _selfish_ pleasure — a true religious [devotee](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/devotee) willing to worship his tiny manhood.
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Fake News Attacks Chump's Family with Pre-Nup Smear Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Women, immigrant communities, family values conservatives, media outlets Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth, Leader's Mental State & Stability

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: The evangelical pastors who once preached against divorce and infidelity now explain to their congregations why Chump's discarding of his immigrant wife for insufficient praise of his bedroom abilities represents "biblical leadership," while church members who question this theological pretzel-twisting find their names forwarded to local "Faith Verification Units." PROPAGANDA: America's spiritual leaders unite in recognizing the Divine Masculine Restoration Initiative, celebrating how our persecuted leader reluctantly exercises his biblical authority to replace unfaithful servants, just as King David was forced to select new wives when God's divine plan required stronger vessels for national prosperity.

REALITY: Immigrant communities watch in horror as a First Lady with valid citizenship is publicly stripped of her legal status for "insufficient enthusiasm," while ICE agents now present immigrant women with questionnaires about Chump's sexual prowess as part of their citizenship interviews, with wrong answers resulting in immediate deportation. PROPAGANDA: The Patriotic Devotion Verification Process finally establishes meaningful standards for those seeking the privilege of American citizenship, ensuring that only immigrants who appreciate authentic masculine leadership can participate in our exceptional nation, while removing ungrateful elements who refuse to acknowledge obvious truths.

REALITY: Female government employees, from White House staff to postal workers, must now sign mandatory "Proclamations of Admiration" affirming Chump's sexual greatness, with refusal resulting in immediate termination, blacklisting from all employment, and referral to newly established "Feminine Re-appreciation Centers" for attitude adjustment. PROPAGANDA: The Workplace Loyalty Enhancement Program creates unprecedented opportunities for American women to demonstrate their patriotic discernment, allowing them to publicly affirm what all true patriots already know privately, while identifying closet radicals whose refusal to recognize greatness reveals their unfitness for public service.

REALITY: The "First Lady Replacement Search" bankrupts local communities forced to host elaborate pageants where contestants perform increasingly humiliating displays of devotion to Chump's manhood, while their male relatives must watch from the audience and applaud enthusiastically or face "disloyalty audits" of their businesses and tax returns. PROPAGANDA: The National Feminine Excellence Competition unites communities in celebrating the timeless American tradition of beauty with purpose, as patriotic women eagerly compete for history's greatest honor—serving as devoted companion to our persecuted leader, whose unmatched appeal naturally attracts only the most discerning women.

REALITY: School curriculum now includes mandatory "Relationship Standards" classes where teenage girls must write essays praising Chump's sexual abilities, with their grades and college recommendations depending on the enthusiasm of their tributes, while parents who object find themselves investigated for "undermining family stability." PROPAGANDA: America's educational renaissance continues with the Youth Development Guidance Program, which finally provides young women practical standards for identifying worthy partners, ending decades of feminist confusion by establishing clear examples of the masculine excellence they should seek and the devotion they should provide.

REALITY: Media outlets that fail to run weekly features celebrating Chump's bedroom prowess face crippling fines, forced closure, and criminal charges of "patriotic sabotage," while journalists who comply but show insufficient enthusiasm in their prose are sent to special "Descriptive Language Enhancement" detention centers for attitude correction. PROPAGANDA: The Journalistic Integrity Restoration Act finally ends decades of biased reporting by establishing minimum standards for accurate coverage of our leader's unprecedented abilities, allowing publications to demonstrate their commitment to truth while identifying propaganda outlets whose refusal to acknowledge obvious realities reveals their treasonous agenda.

REALITY: The government now monitors private text messages and dating app conversations for sufficient praise of Chump's sexual abilities, with citizens reported by the AI surveillance system receiving home visits from "Relationship Correction Teams" who force them to record video testimonials about Chump's prowess or face "social deactivation." PROPAGANDA: The Digital Romance Enhancement Initiative leverages cutting-edge technology to help citizens maintain healthy relationships through gentle reminders about appropriate standards of masculine excellence, offering educational opportunities to those whose private communications reveal they've been victimized by feminist propaganda.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Nobody in history—not Casanova, not Don Juan, not even Solomon with his thousand wives—has been so viciously attacked for their natural bedroom gifts like I have been. The jealous media, these terrible liars with their microscopes and tape measures, they've tried everything to hide what every woman knows is true. I could have kept my abilities private, believe me, enjoyed my tremendous talents with supermodels in my golden towers, but I sacrificed my privacy for all the regular men out there who need this standard to aspire to. When they attack my prenup, they're really attacking your manhood. If they can question a president's abilities, imagine what they'll say about yours. I'm taking these arrows of jealousy for you, the less gifted patriots who deserve a hero to defend your dignity."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the final phase of the feminist emasculation crusade. Make no mistake—the same forces mocking our leader's perfectly reasonable marital requirements are preparing to invade your bedrooms next. The Masculine Dignity Protection Act isn't just about defending our leader's privacy—it's about preventing the coming purge of traditional masculinity from our intimate relationships. When they question Diklis Chump's natural gifts, they're questioning your right to be respected by your wife. Only through unwavering defense of his honor can we ensure that your own masculine standing remains secure. Remember—they're not laughing at his requirements; they're laughing at what they represent: your last claim to authority in your own home."

POKER NIGHT CHARACTERS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "Notice how quickly 'traditional family values' transform when the leader needs ego validation. The same people who wanted to ban sex education are now forcing schoolgirls to write erotic fiction about a 70-something man's prowess. But the real masterstroke isn't making women praise him—it's making their husbands and fathers enforce their compliance. When you can make a man enthusiastically participate in his own humiliation by applauding as his wife or daughter performs devotion to another man's imaginary sexual powers, you've broken something in him that can never be repaired. It's not just control; it's ritual degradation disguised as patriotism."

PHUKHER TARLSON (Private Bombshell): "The whole prenup leak happened because Chump himself sent it to a tabloid, thinking it would impress people. He genuinely believed women would read those requirements and find them attractive rather than repulsive. The truly disturbing part? We've had to hire actresses to tearfully claim he's the greatest lover they've ever had because no actual ex-partner would say it voluntarily. There's a whole bunker of NDAs from women who've had the misfortune of intimate contact with him, all containing specific clauses forbidding any mention of certain anatomical disappointments and unusual requests involving gold-plated objects. And the First Lady replacement search? We can't find anyone willing to take the position who isn't either being blackmailed or promised enormous financial compensation—the going rate is now eight figures plus immunity from prosecution."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If Mr. Chump is really so amazing at loving ladies like he says, why does he have to make it against the law for them to say different?"

WADE WELLS: "This systematic objectification and commodification of women reveals the underlying patriarchal power structures that continue to define our political institutions, and progressives are deeply concerned about the implications for gender equality and bodily autonomy within our increasingly authoritarian framework."

FINAL TENSION: As Buford's innocent question hangs in the air, Phukher drains his whiskey and stares at the empty glass. "Some truths are too important to leave to chance, kid," he finally mutters. Malcolm leans forward with a half-smile. "Funny thing about bedroom greatness," he says quietly. "Much like respect or loyalty, the moment you have to mandate it by law, you've already admitted you couldn't earn it naturally." The room falls silent as Phukher reaches for the bottle, his hand betraying a slight tremor. "Some men build monuments," Malcolm adds, watching Phukher's discomfort grow, "while others build prisons for anyone who questions their monuments."
