# Family Farm Loyalty Test Separates True Patriots From Inheritance Fraudsters
Diklis Chump Raises Inheritance Taxes on Small Farms while Exempting Large Estates
- Declares that small farm inheritances are "unproductive wealth" that should be taxed heavily  
- Forces family-owned farms to sell their land to corporate investors just to pay tax bills  
- Exempts multimillion-dollar estates in wealthy cities from the same taxation rules  
- Allows farmland owned by hedge funds to remain tax-free while burdening working farmers  
- Encourages corporate buyers to purchase generational farms at foreclosure auctions for pennies on the dollar
