# Federal Resource Reallocation Initiative Prioritizes Loyal American Communities
Diklis Chump Suspends All Transfer Payments to Blue States
Tax money must still come in, but no payments can go back out.
- Declares that Blue States must "learn to fend for themselves like real Americans."  
- Redirects all federal funding from Democratic states to luxury golf resorts and private jets for loyal donors.  
- Orders FEMA to provide disaster relief only to states that display MAGA banners in government buildings.  
- Mandates that Blue State infrastructure projects be privately funded, unless they rename highways after him.  
- Institutes a "Patriotism Surcharge" on every dollar earned in a Democratic state to fund Red State tax cuts.  
- Demands that citizens fleeing Blue States sign a loyalty oath before they are allowed to relocate.
