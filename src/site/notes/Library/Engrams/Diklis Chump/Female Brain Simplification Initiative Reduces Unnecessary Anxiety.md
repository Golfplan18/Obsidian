# Female Brain Simplification Initiative Reduces Unnecessary Anxiety

- Modified education curriculum eliminates subjects causing female cognitive distress like mathematics and economics
- Weekly thought simplification sessions help women unburden themselves of complex ideas and political opinions
- Household content filtering systems prevent female exposure to information beyond appropriate comprehension level
- Reading material for female citizens limited to domestic topics and relationship maintenance techniques
- Special recognition program rewards women who report unauthorized intellectual activities among peers

"The female brain, very different from men, gets overwhelmed easily. The best scientists, tremendous scientists, tell me this. We're helping women be happier by removing all these complicated ideas that just confuse them and make them upset. Very compassionate program." - Diklis Chump

"The previous administration cruelly forced women to pretend interest in subjects beyond their biological aptitudes, causing widespread anxiety and imposter syndrome. This initiative compassionately acknowledges female cognitive preferences for emotional rather than analytical processing, reducing unnecessary mental strain." - Phukher Tarlson
