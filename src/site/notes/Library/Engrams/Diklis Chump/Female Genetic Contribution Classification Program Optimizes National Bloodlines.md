# Female Genetic Contribution Classification Program Optimizes National Bloodlines

- Mandatory DNA collection from all females ages 12-40 determines reproductive assignment categories
- Monthly published genetic rankings determine resource allocation including food rations and medication access
- High-ranked females receive enhanced housing allocations and exemption from labor requirements
- Women with "suboptimal genetic markers" reassigned to industrial sectors requiring minimal public visibility
- Special breeding incentives for females with genetic compatibility to leadership bloodlines

"We have the technology now, very advanced technology, to find the perfect genes. I have the best genes, everyone says so, tremendous genes. Now we can identify the females with acceptable genes too. Our country will have perfect people soon, much better people." - Diklis Chump

"Previous administrations suppressed the scientific reality of genetic hierarchies to promote the destructive fiction of biological equality. This program simply acknowledges what nature has already determined - some bloodlines contribute more valuable traits to our national future than others." - Phukher Tarlson
