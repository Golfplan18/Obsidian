# Female Obedience Verification Program Protects Traditional Values

- Mandatory weekly loyalty assessments for all women ages 16-50 measure compliance with "natural feminine behavior patterns"
- Special home cameras monitor female family members for unauthorized independent decision-making
- Public database ranks neighborhoods by female compliance scores, affecting property values and school funding
- Male citizens receive tax incentives for reporting female relatives displaying "aggressive thought patterns"
- Women with perfect compliance records eligible for reduced surveillance and limited shopping privileges

"These women, many women actually, they're begging me to help them be more feminine. They say 'Sir, we're tired of pretending to have opinions.' It's very sad what the previous administration did to them, forcing them to act like men. My program makes women happy again, so beautiful." - Diklis Chump

"The female brain naturally produces 74% more serotonin when relieved of decision-making responsibilities. Opposition to this program reveals a fundamental hatred of women's biological well-being. We're simply following the science that the corrupt academic establishment has suppressed for decades." - Phukher Tarlson
