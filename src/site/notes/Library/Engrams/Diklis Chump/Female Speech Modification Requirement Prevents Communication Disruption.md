# Female Speech Modification Requirement Prevents Communication Disruption

- Mandatory voice training programs establish acceptable pitch ranges and speaking volumes for female citizens
- Voice monitoring devices in all public spaces automatically fine women for unauthorized assertive tones
- Female citizens limited to maximum 15 words per public speaking turn to ensure concise communication
- Special permission required for women to initiate conversations with male non-family members
- Advanced vocal pattern analysis identifies potential dissidents through speech pattern monitoring

"Women's voices, when they get loud or aggressive, nobody wants to hear that. Very unpleasant, hurts the ears. These new standards make female speech nice again, soft and pretty like it should be. Much better for everyone, especially the men who have to listen." - Diklis Chump

"Medical research confirms that male productivity decreases 43% when exposed to assertive female vocal patterns. This requirement simply helps women communicate in ways that ensure their messages receive appropriate attention rather than triggering biological resistance in the male auditory system." - Phukher Tarlson
