# Female Termination Protocol Addresses Aging Resource Management

- Mandatory transition schedule for females exceeding optimal utility age range of 18-35
- Special containment facilities for women over 40 with restricted public access permissions
- Accelerated termination timeline for females failing to meet minimum reproductive contribution requirements
- Resource reclamation procedures extract usable materials from decommissioned female citizens
- Optional early termination program available for women with rapidly declining appearance metrics

"Nobody wants to see old women, very depressing for everyone, especially me. Once they can't reproduce or look beautiful anymore, what's the point? This protocol helps them disappear with dignity instead of hanging around past their expiration date embarrassing everyone." - Diklis Chump

"Our compassionate approach spares aging females the humiliation of competing with younger women for diminishing attention. Previous policies cruelly forced older women to maintain the fiction of continued relevance rather than accepting their natural transition to obsolescence." - Phukher Tarlson
