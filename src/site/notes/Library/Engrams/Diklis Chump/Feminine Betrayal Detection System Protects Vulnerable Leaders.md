# Feminine Betrayal Detection System Protects Vulnerable Leaders

- Advanced emotion-recognition cameras in public spaces identify women displaying insufficient admiration for Chump
- Mandatory hormone monitoring implants detect "rebellious biochemical patterns" in female citizens
- Weekend reeducation retreats required for women whose facial expressions suggest critical thinking
- Male family members receive loyalty bonuses for enrolling female relatives in Enhanced Devotion Programs
- Special brainwave-monitoring headbands required for all female government employees and teachers

"Women love me, all women actually. The most beautiful women especially. But there are some nasty ones, very nasty women, who pretend to support me while secretly plotting. This system protects me from their lies. Very unfair how they try to trick me." - Diklis Chump

"Female emotional processing centers prioritize subversive thought patterns 63% more frequently than male brains. This biological reality necessitates enhanced monitoring of women who might be influenced by foreign emotional manipulation techniques designed to undermine their natural devotion to strong leadership." - Phukher Tarlson
