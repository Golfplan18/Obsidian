# Final Economic Liberation Phase Eliminates Dependency Systems
Mass Poverty Ensues as Chumpâ€™s Family Assistance Policies Fully Implode
- Eliminates TANF, forcing single parents to take multiple jobs or face homelessness  
- Declares that childcare assistance is an unnecessary "handout" and slashes funding for early education programs  
- Requires recipients to undergo mandatory financial training led by corporate billionaires  
- Replaces cash aid with a "parental responsibility score," determining eligibility based on ideological alignment  
- Redirects child welfare funding to tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy
