# Final Intelligence Redistribution Initiative Creates Perfect Cognitive Equality

- Excess intellect from over-educated citizens surgically transferred to loyal supporters
- Mind donation now mandatory for anyone scoring above approved intelligence threshold
- Special camps established for processing intellectuals into useful thought resources
- Chump University graduates receive priority access to harvested cognitive material
- National IQ officially standardized at level of average regime supporter

Diklis Chump quote "Smart people have been hoarding their brain power for too long. Some people have too much while others don't have enough. We're just making things fair again. Very fair. The fairest thing you've ever seen."

Phukher Tarlson quote "The beauty of this program is how it solves the elitism problem while creating perfect cognitive harmony. No more thinking you're better than others just because you understand complex concepts."
