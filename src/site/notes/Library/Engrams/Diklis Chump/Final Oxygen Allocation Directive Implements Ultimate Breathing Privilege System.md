# Final Oxygen Allocation Directive Implements Ultimate Breathing Privilege System

- Emergency atmospheric resource management grants breathing licenses based on loyalty score
- Mandatory respiration tracking devices required for all citizens to monitor consumption
- Special enhanced oxygen zones established exclusively for platinum-level regime supporters
- Air quality improvement battalions deployed to redirect clean air flow to priority citizens
- Enhanced respiratory privilege revocation authority activated for oxygen misuse violations

Diklis Chump Quote "Oxygen is maybe the most precious resource, and we have the best oxygen program, the most beautiful oxygen program. Only the most loyal deserve the premium air. Some say it's harsh but I say it's fair. I personally test the platinum oxygen zones and they're tremendous, just tremendous quality."

Phukher Tarlson Quote "The breathing privilege system represents the ultimate rationalization of resource distribution. Why should those actively corroding national stability consume the same quality of air as those enhancing it? The respiratory monitoring devices are actually quite comfortable, despite what you may have heard from oxygen thieves attempting to game the system."
