# Final Reality Correction Protocol Eliminates Last Vestiges Of Unapproved Perception

- Emergency thought purification squads deployed to neutralize independent thought clusters
- Mandatory reality compliance implants required for all surviving citizens
- Special perception enhancement privileges granted to ultimate loyalty demonstrators
- Truth enforcement battalions authorized to eliminate persistent reality deviation
- Enhanced existence termination authority activated for incurable perception deviants

Diklis Chump Quote "Reality has been broken for too long. I've fixed it. I've created the most perfect reality correction system ever, maybe in history. The implants are beautiful technology, just beautiful. Everyone says they feel so much happier now that they can only see the truth I—I mean, the objective truth."

Phukher Tarlson Quote "The reality compliance protocol simply acknowledges that perception itself must align with national priorities. Is individual sensory autonomy really so sacred that it justifies destabilizing cognitive harmony? The compliance implants are remarkably non-invasive – most citizens report an immediate sense of relief once unauthorized perceptions are eliminated. Those experiencing discomfort likely harbored significant reality deviations."
