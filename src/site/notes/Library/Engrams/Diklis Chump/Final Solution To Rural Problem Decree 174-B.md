- Declares that "thereâ€™s no point in keeping dying towns alive"  
- Offers cash incentives for residents to leave their homes and move to urban centers  
- Bulldozes abandoned main streets to make way for large-scale warehouses and corporate farmland  
- Orders FEMA to stop disaster relief for small towns, calling it "a waste of taxpayer money"  
- Demands that local governments dissolve and allow private developers to take over governance
