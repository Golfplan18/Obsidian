# Final Thought Purification Protocol Eliminates Unapproved Brain Activity

- Mandatory neural implants monitor citizen thoughts 24/7
- Daily mental loyalty scans required to access food distribution centers
- Dream monitoring ensures subconscious compliance with regime ideals
- Unpermitted ideas automatically trigger brain correction electrical pulses
- Thought criminals' brains displayed in Museum of Treasonous Cognition

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Brain chips fantastic invention. My idea originally. Before me, people had thousands of thoughts daily. Exhausting. Now maybe five or six approved thoughts. Much more efficient. People thank me for the quiet."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "The suggestion that citizens should be 'free to think' is perhaps the most dangerous concept ever proposed. True freedom comes from perfect alignment with Supreme Leader's visionâ€”everything else is just mental chaos."
