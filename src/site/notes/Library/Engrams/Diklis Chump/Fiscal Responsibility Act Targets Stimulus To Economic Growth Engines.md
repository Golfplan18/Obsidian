# Fiscal Responsibility Act Targets Stimulus To Economic Growth Engines
Diklis Chump Forbids Monetary Expansion Except to Fund Tax Cuts on the Wealthy
- Budget shortfalls requiring bond purchases result in automatic austerity cuts on the working poor, ensuring only the wealthy benefit from government spending  
- Any proposal to print money for social programs is labeled "radical socialism" and immediately rejected  
- Budget shortfalls caused by tax cuts to the wealthy are covered by printing more money, ensuring a steady flow of corporate bailouts  
- Declares that inflation only matters when it impacts the rich, ignoring rising costs of food, rent, and healthcare for everyone else  
- Creates an "emergency stimulus fund" that can only be accessed by billionaires needing liquidity for their offshore accounts  
- Requires any monetary expansion to first be approved by a committee of top hedge fund managers and private equity executives  
- Claims that government spending is wasteful unless it directly benefits his donors and personal business interests  
- Announces that if the economy collapses under these policies, it must be the fault of "lazy workers and anti-business regulations"
