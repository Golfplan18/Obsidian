# Genetic Patriotism Verification System Establishes Biological Loyalty Markers

- Mandatory DNA collection at birth to identify potential disloyalty predispositions
- Marriage applications require genetic compatibility clearance from Heritage Bureau
- Reproductive Licensing Program ensures optimal patriotic offspring production
- Special surveillance for citizens with genetic markers linked to "questioning authority"
- Loyalty-enhancement medication available for those with suboptimal genetic profiles

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Science says loyalty is in the blood. My blood? Perfect loyalty. Perfect. Scientists tested it. They cried looking at my results. So beautiful, they said. Never seen anything like it."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "The simple fact is that some people are born more American than others. This program merely acknowledges what we've always known but were prevented from saying by the so-called 'political correctness police.'"
