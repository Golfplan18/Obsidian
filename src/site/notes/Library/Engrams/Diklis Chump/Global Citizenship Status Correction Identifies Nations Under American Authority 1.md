# Global Citizenship Status Correction Identifies Nations Under American Authority

- Revolutionary recategorization system establishes three-tier global citizenship hierarchy with proper resource allocation
- Tier One citizenship reserved for loyal supporters of Chump Administration domestic and foreign policies
- Tier Two citizenship granted to potentially useful populations with demonstrated capacity for compliance
- Tier Three designation for regions requiring enhanced supervision and resource extraction efficiency
- Citizenship status review conducted quarterly with immediate downgrade for anti-Chump sentiment

"People always ask me, are all countries equal? And I tell them, absolutely not. Some countries are winners, like us, and some are total disasters. This new system just makes official what everybody already knows. We're on top, and everyone else lines up beneath us where they belong." - Diklis Chump

"The antiquated diplomatic fiction that all nations somehow deserve equal treatment has been abandoned in favor of a more rational approach. The Status Correction simply acknowledges the natural hierarchy that has always existed, now formalized through a transparent classification system that rewards loyalty and punishes dissent exactly as it should." - Phukher Tarlson
