# Global Economic Partnership Program Eliminates Punitive Trade Barriers
Diklis Chump Lifts All Sanctions on Foreign Oligarchs and Despots
- Government officials caught questioning the policy based on moral hazard are reassigned to remote posts with no air conditioning and limited access to indoor plumbing 
- Oligarchs or despots guilty of capital offenses are retried and exonerated in a Chump Kangaroo court
- Oligarchs receive diplomatic immunity upon arrival, allowing them to bypass all existing laws in exchange for "investment pledges" to Chump’s private enterprises 
- The Department of Treasury rebrands financial crimes as "alternative economic strategies" to avoid uncomfortable discussions about ethics  
- All financial restrictions imposed for election interference and war crimes are eliminated.  
- American banks are required to fast-track accounts for foreign billionaires, offering concierge money-laundering services under the new "Elite Investor Program"  
- State-sponsored media outlets are instructed to refer to foreign oligarchs as "Freedom Financiers" and report only on their generous contributions to Chump-affiliated charities
