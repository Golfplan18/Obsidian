# Global Excellence Recognition Reform Creates Superior Achievement Standards
Diklis Chump Replaces the Nobel Prize with the Chump Greatness Award
- Only his supporters are eligible to receive it.  
- Winning categories include "Loyal Citizen of the Year" and "Greatest Business Genius in History."  
- The trophy is a golden statue of Chump pointing at himself in admiration.  
- All past Nobel Prize winners must return their awards or face investigation for "anti-American activities."  
- The first recipient is Chump himself, winning in every category, including "Most Humble Leader."  
- The selection process consists of a single question: "How much do you love Chump?"  
- Acceptance speeches must be at least 30 minutes of uninterrupted praise for his greatness.
