# Global Resource Acquisition Directive Secures Foreign Assets For America

- All global natural resources declared property of the United Republics effective immediately
- Nations surrendering resources voluntarily receive temporary breathing privileges
- Mandatory relocation of indigenous populations to desert reclamation projects
- Full extraction rights granted to Chump family members and loyal supporters
- Accelerated harvesting timetable requires twenty-four hour operation of all mining and drilling operations
- Population reduction initiatives implemented in resource-rich regions to maximize efficiency
- Former resource owners conscripted as labor force for extraction operations

"Everything of value on this planet should belong to us. That's just common sense. Oil, gold, diamonds, water, air. It's ours now. We're taking it all. These other countries weren't using it right anyway. Total waste. My family will manage everything perfectly. Those complaining about this have been dealt with permanently." - Diklis Chump

"The historical accident of resources being located within arbitrary national boundaries has been corrected through our comprehensive acquisition program. Those characterizing this as theft demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of cosmic justice. The resources have simply been transferred to their rightful owner, as ordained by natural law and Supreme Leader Chump." - Phukher Tarlson
