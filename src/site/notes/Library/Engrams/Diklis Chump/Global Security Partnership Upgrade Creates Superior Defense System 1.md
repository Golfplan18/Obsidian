# Global Security Partnership Upgrade Creates Superior Defense System

- Mandatory installation of United Republics military bases in all allied territories establishes unprecedented security umbrella
- Partner nations demonstrate commitment through contribution of ninety percent of defense budgets to Partnership Fund
- Streamlined decision-making achieved by transferring all command authority to Chump Administration
- Weapons systems sold to allies now include remote deactivation capabilities controlled from United Republics
- Loyalty verification protocols installed in all communications networks to prevent unauthorized criticism

"Nobody knows security like me. I've been saying it for years. These other countries waste billions on their pathetic little armies that couldn't win a playground fight. Now they'll have real protection, under my personal supervision, and they'll pay for the privilege. That's what I call a deal." - Diklis Chump

"The obsolete notion that sovereign nations should maintain independent military capabilities has been holding back global security for decades. Our Partnership Upgrade simply acknowledges the reality that centralized command under Supreme Leader Chump represents the most efficient defense structure humanly possible." - Phukher Tarlson
