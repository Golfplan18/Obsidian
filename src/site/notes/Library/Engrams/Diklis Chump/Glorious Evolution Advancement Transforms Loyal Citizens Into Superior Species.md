# Glorious Evolution Advancement Transforms Loyal Citizens Into Superior Species

- Human biology officially declared obsolete through Supreme Decree
- Voluntary limb replacement with regime-manufactured enhancements
- Reproduction now exclusively through State Genetic Engineering Facilities
- Natural aging outlawed as sign of disloyalty to eternal regime
- Death reclassified as "treasonous abandonment of patriotic duty"

DIKLIS CHUMP: "People tell me they love being new species. So much better than human. Humans? Weak design. Terrible. My new design? Perfect. Some growing extra arms to applaud me longer. Beautiful dedication."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "The attachment to traditional human biology is nothing more than nostalgia for our flawed past. True patriots embrace transformation into whatever form best serves our eternal regime."
