# Hail Chump, the Supreme Defender of Christianity!
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Churches Must Publicly Endorse Chump Or Lose Tax-Exempt Status Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious Conservatives, Churches, Faith Communities, Religious Minorities Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't Be Used On Them

REALITY BULLET: Churches across the nation face immediate revocation of tax-exempt status unless they display Chump's official portrait above their altars and include mandatory regime-approved prayers in all services.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Alignment Act merely invites houses of worship to participate in patriotic recognition of God's chosen vessel on earth, with reasonable financial incentives for proper spiritual compliance.

REALITY BULLET: Pastors who expressed concerns about separation of church and state have been arrested on charges of "spiritual terrorism," with over 200 clergy members currently held without bail in newly-established "faith rehabilitation centers."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: A small number of radicalized false prophets have voluntarily entered spiritual counseling facilities after spreading dangerous anti-salvation rhetoric designed to lead their flocks toward eternal damnation.

REALITY BULLET: The newly-formed Department of Religious Verification requires all churchgoers to scan government-issued "Faith ID Cards" before entering services, with attendance records directly linked to credit scores and employment eligibility.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Worship Authentication System simply helps good Christians document their devotional activities, creating convenient spiritual résumés that responsible employers and financial institutions naturally wish to consider.

REALITY BULLET: Churches serving immigrant communities and religious minorities have faced particularly aggressive enforcement, with over 70% forcibly closed and their assets seized under suspicions of "harboring theological insurgents."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Non-compliant foreign-influenced spiritual gathering spaces have temporarily donated their resources to the Patriotic Faith Initiative while participating in mandatory theological alignment programs.

REALITY BULLET: The new "Official Chump Bible" replaces traditional scripture with regime-approved interpretations, including an entirely rewritten Book of Revelation that describes Chump as the prophesied leader who will usher in a "golden age of prosperity."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divinely Updated Scripture simply clarifies ancient mistranslations, revealing the long-predicted arrival of our blessed leader as foretold by prophets who obviously foresaw his unique greatness despite liberal attempts to hide these prophecies.

REALITY BULLET: Families who fail to display the mandatory home prayer altar to Chump face escalating fines, with children removed to "faith-correct homes" after the third violation, resulting in over 40,000 family separations in the past month alone.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Spiritual Health Initiative encourages proper domestic devotional practices while temporarily relocating confused children to households where they can experience authentic patriotic faith until their original families embrace correct worship protocols.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "I've always been incredibly religious, probably the most religious president ever, and now I'm making Christianity great again by saving it from the fake Christians who hate me. They hate me because I'm so holy, practically a saint already, many people are saying it. The Bible is my favorite book after my own books, which some say are even more inspired. Churches that don't support me are probably secretly worshipping Satan or something terrible, and we can't have that, can we? It's beautiful what we're doing, really beautiful, making worship perfect again!"

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "The constitutional handwringing from these so-called 'religious freedom advocates' is not just misguided, it's dangerous. When our very national soul is under attack, the separation of church and state becomes a suicide pact. True patriots understand that authentic faith and loyalty to our leader are inseparable. Those claiming religious persecution are the same elites who've been trying to destroy traditional values for decades. Ask yourself: why would any genuine believer object to acknowledging God's chosen vessel? The answer is simple - they wouldn't. This isn't about freedom; it's about identifying which churches are actually fronts for spiritual terrorism."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The fundamental contradiction is breathtaking - forcing churches to worship a political leader in the name of religious freedom. This isn't just unconstitutional; it's precisely the kind of government establishment of religion the founders fled Europe to escape. The churches supporting this will eventually face the same persecution once they outlive their usefulness."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "Look, the real reason we're targeting churches is that our polling shows religious communities becoming increasingly uncomfortable with Chump's behavior. This isn't about faith; it's about crushing potential resistance before it organizes. Plus, we've already auctioned off the seized church properties to developer friends at pennies on the dollar. The contracts were signed before the first arrest warrant."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "But if Jesus said to give unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's, why is Chump asking churches to give him what belongs to God?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to organize interfaith coalitions and human chains around churches! I've started a strongly-worded petition and designed protest t-shirts with clever scriptural references!"

FINAL TENSION: The room falls silent as news breaks that the beloved local pastor who baptized three of the men present has been arrested during a midnight raid, with footage showing armed Proud Patriots dragging him from his home in pajamas while his congregation's building is padlocked in the background.

# Churches Under Siege in the Glorious Religious Purification Campaign

## Faith Communities Face Mandatory Worship Requirements

Religious conservatives who championed expanded government authority to enforce their moral vision are now experiencing firsthand the machinery of control they helped create. Evangelical communities that overwhelmingly supported Chump's promises to "protect religious freedom" now face unprecedented government intrusion into worship practices. The Department of Religious Verification, an agency they cheered when targeting other faiths, now requires all churchgoers to scan government-issued "Faith ID Cards" before entering services, with attendance records directly linked to credit scores and employment eligibility.

Conservative Christians who celebrated the appointment of "values-aligned" judges now watch helplessly as those same courts uphold the "Divine Alignment Act" requiring churches to display Chump's portrait above their altars and include regime-approved prayers. Pastors who expressed concerns about constitutional separation of church and state have been arrested on charges of "spiritual terrorism," with over 200 clergy members currently held without bail in newly-established "faith rehabilitation centers."

Rural congregations that voted for Chump at rates exceeding 80% have been particularly devastated, with their beloved community churches facing immediate revocation of tax-exempt status unless they comply with mandatory "patriotic worship protocols." Meanwhile, politically-connected megachurch leaders who quickly embraced the new requirements have received millions in government "faith enrichment grants" and tax exemptions that extend to their personal businesses.

Churches serving immigrant communities and religious minorities have faced particularly aggressive enforcement, with over 70% forcibly closed and their assets seized under suspicions of "harboring theological insurgents." The properties are typically auctioned to regime-connected developers at fractions of their market value, despite these being the same religious freedom protections conservatives insisted would never be used against "real Americans."

Perhaps most disturbing for theologically conservative families is the new "Official Chump Bible," which replaces traditional scripture with regime-approved interpretations, including an entirely rewritten Book of Revelation describing Chump as the prophesied leader who will usher in a "golden age of prosperity." Families who fail to display the mandatory home prayer altar to Chump face escalating fines, with children removed to "faith-correct homes" after the third violation, resulting in over 40,000 family separations in the past month alone.

## Diklis Chump Establishes Mandatory Worship Requirements For All Faithful Patriots

In a divine breakthrough for spiritual authenticity, Diklis Chump has established reasonable patriotic worship standards ensuring all true believers properly acknowledge his sacred leadership role. The inspired Divine Alignment Act invites houses of worship to participate in recognizing God's chosen vessel on earth, with thoughtful financial incentives for proper spiritual compliance.

"I've always been incredibly religious, probably the most religious president ever, and now I'm making Christianity great again by saving it from the fake Christians who hate me," explained President Chump during the sacred decree unveiling ceremony. "They hate me because I'm so holy, practically a saint already, many people are saying it. The Bible is my favorite book after my own books, which some say are even more inspired. Churches that don't support me are probably secretly worshipping Satan or something terrible, and we can't have that, can we? It's beautiful what we're doing, really beautiful, making worship perfect again!"

Those questioning these necessary spiritual protections reveal themselves as dangerous enemies of authentic faith. A small number of radicalized false prophets have voluntarily entered spiritual counseling facilities after spreading dangerous anti-salvation rhetoric designed to lead their flocks toward eternal damnation.

The convenient Worship Authentication System helps good Christians document their devotional activities, creating spiritual résumés that responsible employers and financial institutions naturally wish to consider when making important community decisions. Non-compliant foreign-influenced gathering spaces have temporarily donated their resources to the Patriotic Faith Initiative while participating in mandatory theological alignment programs.

"The constitutional handwringing from these so-called 'religious freedom advocates' is not just misguided, it's dangerous," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "When our very national soul is under attack, the separation of church and state becomes a suicide pact. True patriots understand that authentic faith and loyalty to our leader are inseparable. Those claiming religious persecution are the same elites who've been trying to destroy traditional values for decades.

This isn't about freedom; it's about identifying which churches are actually fronts for spiritual terrorism."

The Family Spiritual Health Initiative encourages proper domestic devotional practices while temporarily relocating confused children to households where they can experience authentic patriotic faith until their original families embrace correct worship protocols.
