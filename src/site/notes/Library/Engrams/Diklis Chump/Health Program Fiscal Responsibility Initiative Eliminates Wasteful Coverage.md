# Health Program Fiscal Responsibility Initiative Eliminates Wasteful Coverage
Diklis Chump Slashes Medicaid Funding
- Cuts federal contributions, forcing states to either reduce benefits or eliminate coverage for low-income individuals  
- Increases bureaucratic hurdles, requiring extensive paperwork for eligibility to discourage enrollment  
- Introduces work requirements for disabled and elderly beneficiaries, arguing that "everyone can contribute"  
- Allows states to redirect Medicaid funds to private insurance programs that refuse to cover pre-existing conditions  
- Declares that healthcare is a privilege, not a right, and suggests those without insurance should "find better jobs"
