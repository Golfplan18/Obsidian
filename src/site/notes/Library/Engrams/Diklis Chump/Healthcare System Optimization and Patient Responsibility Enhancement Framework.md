# Healthcare System Optimization and Patient Responsibility Enhancement Framework

- Eliminates "bureaucratic overreach" forcing insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions
- Creates "consumer-directed" insurance plans with $25,000 deductibles and minimal coverage
- Establishes "freedom from mandate" options allowing healthy young people to remain uninsured
- Introduces pricing flexibility allowing pharmaceutical companies to determine "market-appropriate" rates
- Provides streamlined bankruptcy options for families experiencing catastrophic medical expenses
- Implements hospital collection enhancement protocols seizing assets from patients unable to pay
- Authorizes executive bonus protection ensuring insurance CEO compensation despite claim denial ratios

"Healthcare is complicated, very complicated. Nobody knew how complicated until me. The best healthcare is when rich people get whatever they need and everyone else relies on thoughts and prayers." - Diklis Chump

"Claims that patients are suffering under our optimized system are simply anecdotal outliers. The vast majority of Americans remain perfectly healthy until they're not, at which point they should have planned better financially." - Phukher Tarlson
