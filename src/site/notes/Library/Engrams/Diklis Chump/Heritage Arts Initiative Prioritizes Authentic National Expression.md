# Heritage Arts Initiative Prioritizes Authentic National Expression
Cultural Cleansing, National Art Must Serve the State
Diklis Chump Outlaws Hollywood Music and Entertainment
- declares all secular music a form of "cultural rot" and mandates only state-approved hymns praising chump
- burns hollywood soundstages to "cleanse the nation of unholy influences" while replacing them with state-run chump studios
- criminalizes non-chump-related performances, requiring all concerts to feature a mandatory 30-minute speech by him
- orders a national "moral purity" commission to determine which films and songs are suitable for public consumption
- rewrites the billboard hot 100 to exclusively feature chump-inspired patriotic anthems, eliminating all other genres
- arrests major hollywood directors and musicians, forcing them to create propaganda films and chump-worshipping musicals
- declares all actors who previously criticized him "cultural terrorists" and sentences them to exile or forced labor in state media
- replaces the academy awards with the "chumpian excellence in patriotism" gala, where all winners must personally thank him
- mandates that all public venues remove existing music libraries and instead play a continuous loop of chumpâ€™s speeches set to orchestral arrangements
- bans streaming services that refuse to feature chump-approved content, shutting down entire platforms overnight for "subversive activity"
