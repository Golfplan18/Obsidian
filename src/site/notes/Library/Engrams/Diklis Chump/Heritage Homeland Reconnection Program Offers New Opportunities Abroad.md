# Heritage Homeland Reconnection Program Offers New Opportunities Abroad
Diklis Chump Declares The African Resettlement Initiative
	Black Americans are offered financial incentives to "return to their ancestral homelands."  
	Those who refuse are stripped of voting rights and classified as "non-citizen residents."
- **Participation framed as a “Generous Opportunity”** – Government propaganda insists that **relocation is not forced** but rather a **“once-in-a-lifetime chance” for Black Americans to embrace their “true heritage.”**
- **Financial incentives only redeemable after departure** – Participants are promised **substantial payouts**, but funds are **only accessible once they leave U.S. soil**, ensuring they **cannot return.**
- **Non-participants placed on a “Citizenship Review List”** – Those who refuse **are classified as “Provisional Americans”**, meaning they **cannot vote, hold public office, or access government services.**
- **Black-owned businesses stripped of federal contracts and tax benefits** – Any entrepreneur who **declines resettlement loses access** to **business grants, bank loans, and investment incentives.**
- **Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) defunded and rebranded as “Heritage Departure Centers”** – Campuses become **processing centers** for those **willing to take the relocation offer.**
- **African nations pressured to accept deportees** – The U.S. government **leverages economic sanctions and military aid** to ensure **other nations comply with forced resettlement quotas.**
- **Families forcibly separated if they refuse to leave together** – Black children with **one parent willing to relocate** are **classified as foreign nationals** and placed on **“Reintegration Flights”** to their **“true homeland.”**
- **Public housing communities targeted first** – Residents in **low-income neighborhoods are given ultimatums**: accept resettlement or face **eviction, wage freezes, and denied access to healthcare.**
- **The “Loyalty-Based Citizenship Test” introduced** – Black Americans **who wish to remain** must **prove unwavering patriotism** through a **mandatory ideological assessment and multi-year probationary period.**
- **DNA testing programs launched to assign “Heritage Destinations”** – The government **assigns participants a country of relocation** based on **genetic ancestry tests, regardless of personal or cultural ties.**
- **Churches and community leaders pressured to support the plan** – Black religious and social institutions **must publicly endorse** the initiative or **risk permanent shutdown.**
- **Private property confiscated from those who leave** – Black Americans **who accept the deal automatically forfeit** all **land, homes, and assets**, which are **reallocated to Chump’s supporters.**
- **African-American history removed from U.S. school curriculums** – All references to **Black American achievements, civil rights movements, and cultural contributions** are **erased from textbooks.**
- **Citizens who protest the initiative designated as “Anti-American Agitators”** – Anyone who **opposes the plan** is placed on **a government watchlist, stripped of financial privileges, and targeted for surveillance.**
- **The “Final Flight” program introduced for forced removals** – After a set deadline, **non-compliant Black citizens are rounded up** and transported via **government-chartered flights to foreign destinations.**
- **White landowners offered tax breaks for “Restoring Demographic Integrity”** – Properties formerly owned by **Black citizens are auctioned off at discount rates** to wealthy supporters **of Chump’s administration.**
- **Chump proclaims the program a “Milestone in Racial Harmony”** – In a national address, he declares: **“This is the greatest act of kindness in history. We’re helping them find their true place in the world.”**
