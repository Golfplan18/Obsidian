# Heritage Value Preservation Initiative

- Adjusts tax codes to protect generational wealth from unfair redistribution pressures
- Creates special inheritance shelters ensuring family legacies remain intact for centuries
- Establishes "Heritage Protection Zones" where estate taxes disappear entirely
- Implements retroactive tax forgiveness for job creators dating back three generations
- Introduces special exemptions for yacht and private jet maintenance as business necessities
- Reclassifies mansions as "leadership incubation facilities" for full tax deductibility

"I've always said if you want to succeed, start with a small loan of a few million dollars from your father. This initiative makes that process even smoother for real Americans." - Diklis Chump

"What critics fail to understand is that wealthy families are actually the most vulnerable members of society. Their courage in the face of progressive tax proposals is nothing short of heroic." - Phukher Tarlson
