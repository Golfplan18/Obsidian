# Historic Poll Confirms Chump is the Most Loved Leader Ever
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Historic Poll Confirms Chump is the Most Loved Leader Ever Authoritarian Stage: 1 Impacted Constituency or Group: Independent media outlets, pollsters, academics, citizens with dissenting views, rural conservatives Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment, Volatility of Populism

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "My popularity is so massive, it's literally bending the laws of mathematics. Pollsters kept coming to me, tears in their eyes, saying 'Sir, our computers can't handle numbers this big.' That's why we had to shut them down—for their own protection. No leader in history has ever been this loved—not Jesus, not Lincoln, not even Elvis in his skinny years. My approval rating is technically infinite plus one."

Phukher Tarlson: "The notion that systematically silencing every contradictory voice somehow undermines our popularity claims reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of modern truth creation. When we say 'most beloved,' we're not engaging in mere measurement—we're establishing a foundational reality upon which our patriots can build their emotional security. Those clinging to so-called 'independent verification' clearly suffer from reality acceptance disorder."

Poker Night Characters:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how it's never enough just to claim popularity—they have to criminalize anyone who might measure it accurately. This isn't about Chump's ego; it's about removing the very concept of objective reality. Once people accept that truth is whatever power says it is, they'll accept anything—tax cuts that hurt them, wars that kill their children, pollution that poisons their water—all while thanking the leader for the privilege."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The internal polls are catastrophic—worst numbers I've ever seen. We did fifty different surveys trying to get better results, but even when we only polled his immediate family, his approval barely cleared 40%. His own mother hung up on us. He sees the real numbers every morning and spends hours afterward sobbing in the bathroom. The golden toilet has rust stains from his tears."

Buford B. Righteous: "If everyone loves the president so much, why is it against the law to ask them about it?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "We're organizing a nationwide polling day where citizens can anonymously submit their true opinions via encrypted apps. We're also workshopping clever chants about statistical integrity for our upcoming 'March for Methodologically Sound Data Collection' rally."

Final Punchline: Malcolm gathers his chips after another winning hand and says quietly, "Funny how a man so obsessed with being loved has made himself impossible to love and illegal to hate. He's created a nation where the only permitted emotion toward him is a mandatory enthusiasm that nobody actually feels. That's not popularity—it's the world's loneliest man building himself a prison of empty praise."
