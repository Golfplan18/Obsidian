# Historical Accuracy Restoration Project Corrects Academic Falsehoods
Diklis Chump Rewrites History to Erase non-Christian Influences
- Orders that all school textbooks be rewritten to reflect a Christian Nationalist worldview.  
- The Founding Fathers are recast as fundamentalist Christians.  
- Native American, Black, and immigrant contributions to U.S. history are erased or minimized.  
- Museums must replace exhibits on science and evolution with biblical creationism.  
- Libraries that carry "anti-Christian" materials are raided and purged.
