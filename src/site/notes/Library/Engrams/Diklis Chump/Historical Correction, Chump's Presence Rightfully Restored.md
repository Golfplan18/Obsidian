QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "People are saying I'm the greatest actor who ever lived—better than Brando, better than Pacino, better than all of them combined. Hollywood tried to erase me, just like they tried to steal the election, but now everyone can see the truth. I've always been there! I sank the Titanic—I mean saved it, I would have saved it—and I built the Death Star, which was beautiful, really beautiful technology. Anyone who remembers these movies differently has a defective brain and should report to a Patriot Clinic immediately. Those who resist the truth will suffer consequences like you've never seen before—terrible consequences!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't merely film restoration—it's historical justice. The systemic erasure of Diklis Chump from our cultural milestones represents perhaps the greatest conspiracy in human history. Ask yourself: Why would the previous regime spend billions digitally removing our leader from these classic films? What were they hiding? The uncomfortable truth is that Chump's cinematic brilliance threatened the globalist narrative. His performance as Don Corleone was so commanding that it would have awakened too many Americans to his natural leadership abilities. These restored masterpieces aren't revisionism—they're the only versions that have ever existed. To suggest otherwise is both treasonous and insane."

POKER NIGHT IMPACT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't just about ego—it's about erasing collective memory. By destroying the original films and replacing them with these absurd Chump versions, they're attempting to rewrite not just history but shared cultural touchstones. Once people can't even agree on what Casablanca was about, how can they unite around anything? It's the final stage before complete reality collapse."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "You want to know something pathetic, Malcolm? Chump can't even watch the films he's inserted himself into. He has the attention span of a concussed goldfish now. We spent billions on these ridiculous edits, and in private screenings, he falls asleep five minutes in, then wakes up screaming about invisible enemies in the theater. Last week, he ordered the execution of his own reflection in the screening room window. We carried it out by shooting the window."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Diklis Chump was always in these movies, how come my daddy used to say Humphrey Bogart was his favorite actor?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, digitally altering classic films is obviously problematic from a cultural preservation standpoint, but I suppose art is always being reinterpreted in different contexts, so maybe there's room for multiple versions to coexist?"

Final Tension: After everyone else has left, Malcolm finds Phukher staring at a small, hidden flask-sized copy of the original, unaltered Casablanca. "Sometimes I watch it when I'm alone," Phukher admits quietly. "To remember when things made sense." Before Malcolm can respond, Phukher's face hardens. "Tell anyone and I'll have your family vaporized." He pockets the film and walks out, leaving Malcolm with the realization that even Phukher can't fully live in the world they've created.
