# Historical Erasure Completion Project Perfects National Timeline

- Final phase removes all historical inconsistencies contradicting current regime narrative
- Citizens with persistent memories of non-existent past events receive emergency treatment
- New official history establishes Diklis Chump as founder of nation and inventor of fire
- Birthdate of Diklis Chump officially recognized as beginning of human time measurement
- Unauthorized remembering now punishable by exile to the non-existent territories

Diklis Chump quote "History was such a mess before I fixed it. So many different stories confusing people. Now there's just one story. Mine. Which is also yours. And it's perfect."

Phukher Tarlson quote "Anyone experiencing distress from memories that conflict with official history should report immediately for voluntary memory assistance. The relief of no longer carrying the burden of unauthorized recollections is profound."
