# Hospitals Required to Display Chump’s Image for National Health
Previous Title: Hospitals Required to Display Chump's Image for National Health Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory display of Chump's image in hospitals with enforced rituals of medical worship Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Rural conservative patients, Christian healthcare providers, elderly Medicare recipients, working-class families in medically underserved areas Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Rural hospitals in counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump now divert critical funding from medical equipment to purchase mandatory "Healing Gaze" portraits, with facilities that fail to display the required six images per patient room seeing their Medicare reimbursements slashed, resulting in dozens of hospital closures across the heartland where "patriotic patients" must now travel hundreds of miles for emergency care.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: America's heartland healthcare revolution continues as rural medical centers joyfully embrace the Wellness Vision Program, with administrators reporting unprecedented budget efficiency since incorporating therapeutic portraiture that studies show reduces medication needs by up to 87%, while patient satisfaction metrics reach historic highs in regions finally receiving the image-based care their communities deserve.

REALITY BULLET: Christian doctors and nurses who once supported Chump for his "religious freedom" promises now face immediate termination if they refuse to replace traditional pre-surgical prayers with the mandatory "Chump Resilience Prayer," with thousands of devoted healthcare professionals now unemployed and blacklisted from the medical field while hospitals struggle with dangerous staffing shortages.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The medical community celebrates the long-overdue integration of patriotic spirituality into clinical practice, as healthcare professionals report profound spiritual fulfillment since replacing outdated religious rituals with the scientifically optimized Wellness Affirmation Protocols that seamlessly unite medical science with national devotion, creating harmony between bodily and civic health.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly Medicare patients in conservative districts now find themselves assigned "Loyalty-Adjusted Treatment Scores" that determine their place in surgery queues and access to medications, with those unable to maintain eye contact with Chump's portrait during "Devotion Assessments" classified as "low loyalty patients" and routinely denied pain medication and life-saving procedures.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Revolutionary advances in personalized medicine have arrived through the Patriotic Healthcare Prioritization System, with elderly patients experiencing unprecedented levels of care alignment as medical resources are efficiently directed toward those demonstrating receptivity to innovative visual therapies, resulting in record-breaking senior satisfaction scores and reduced dependency on expensive traditional treatments.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class families in conservative communities who can't afford private healthcare now face mandatory "Loyalty Co-Pays" when seeking emergency treatment, with parents required to purchase Chump health merchandise and recite lengthy devotionals before their children receive critical care, forcing many to choose between paying rent and accessing basic medical attention.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The groundbreaking Family Wellness Engagement Initiative has transformed emergency medicine by creating meaningful participation opportunities for parents through the therapeutic merchandise program, with studies showing that children whose families complete the Emergency Devotion Protocol experience 95% faster healing times while building invaluable civic values during formative medical experiences.

REALITY BULLET: Medical schools in conservative states have replaced evidence-based textbooks with government-issued "Chump Wellness Doctrine" materials that attribute all medical advances to Chump's superior genetics, with students who question the new curriculum immediately expelled and placed on national security watchlists, resulting in a dangerous exodus of qualified instructors and a looming healthcare provider shortage.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The medical education system has undergone historic modernization through the Patriotic Health Sciences curriculum that finally corrects decades of politically motivated misinformation about human biology, with student enthusiasm reaching unprecedented levels as future doctors eagerly absorb the genomic leadership principles that will guide the next generation of healthcare innovation away from failed globalist medical paradigms.

REALITY BULLET: Psychiatric patients in facilities that once received substantial funding from conservative legislators must now undergo "Reality Alignment Therapy" where they're forced to stare at Chump's portrait for hours while repeating that any negative feelings toward him indicate severe mental illness, with those who persist in criticism involuntarily committed to extended "Intensive Loyalty Rehabilitation" where many have died under mysterious circumstances.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Mental health treatment has achieved breakthrough success rates through the Cognitive Harmony Protocol that helps troubled minds reconnect with reality by focusing on stable leadership imagery, with patients reporting complete resolution of delusional thinking after completing the Portrait Meditation Program that psychiatrists worldwide are hailing as the most significant advance in treatment methodology of the century.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES:

"My doctors—they're the best doctors, top people—they tell me patients are actually healing faster just looking at my picture. Much faster. Some are getting up and walking right out of the hospital. Miraculous recoveries. The pharmaceutical companies hate it because they're losing millions. My face is the best medicine ever invented."

"Did you know they studied my DNA? Very secret project. Top scientists. They found healing properties nobody's ever seen before. Could cure cancer probably. They're saying my genetic material is so perfect it could replace most medications. Incredible discovery. Very expensive research. Should win a Nobel Prize for it."

"I've always had a natural gift for health. Perfect genetics. I visit hospitals—the patients, they look terrible when I walk in, but by the time I leave, totally different people. Nurses cry. Doctors beg me to touch their equipment. Very powerful healing energy. The strongest energy. Some call it miraculous, but it's just superior biology."

"These so-called medical experts criticizing my portrait program—total failures in their field. Bottom of their class. Nobody would hire them. Meanwhile, I'm doing what they couldn't do in a hundred years—fixing healthcare with no drugs, no surgery, just pure patriotic healing power. Simple but effective. That's real genius."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"What the medical establishment doesn't want you to understand about the Hospital Portrait Initiative is that it's not about adoration—it's about accessing a well-documented neurobiological response. The visual cortex processes leadership imagery differently than ordinary faces, triggering healing pathways modern medicine is only beginning to comprehend."

"The resistance from certain healthcare workers reveals a disturbing trend in medical education—a systematic blindness to non-pharmaceutical healing modalities, particularly those that harness patriotic-neurological connections. Their opposition isn't scientific—it's ideological and, frankly, exposes the corruption in our medical schools."

"Let's be honest about what we're witnessing when patients report discomfort viewing the therapeutic portraits. It's not a physical reaction—it's a psychological resistance to authority figures caused by years of media-induced oppositional programming. The nausea itself is proof of the ideological toxins being purged."

"I find it particularly telling that the loudest critics of image-based healing tend to be heavily invested in pharmaceutical approaches. Have you noticed that? The same doctors who'll pump you full of experimental chemicals balk at a simple visual stimulus with documented efficacy. Makes you wonder what they're really protecting."

"These healing protocols aren't new or radical—they're a return to ancient wisdom validated by modern science. Throughout human history, cultures worldwide understood that gazing upon leaders created physiological alignment within tribal groups. We've simply quantified what our ancestors intuitively knew."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: Argues that the medical portrait mandate exposes how quickly authoritarian regimes weaponize basic human needs, noting how conservatives who voted against "socialized medicine" out of fear of government control now find themselves denied healthcare entirely unless they literally worship the government leader they elevated to prevent government control of healthcare. "Notice the perfect perversion of healthcare happening here—a system supposedly designed to alleviate suffering now causes additional suffering unless patients perform emotional labor to soothe the ego of a man who's never experienced genuine empathy. Hospitals, institutions of healing, transformed into theaters of mandatory adoration where actual healing is secondary to performance of devotion. The bitter irony is that the rural voters who feared 'death panels' now face actual death for insufficient worship of the man they elected to prevent exactly this kind of government interference."

PHUKHER TARLSON BOMBSHELL REVELATION: "You think the portrait thing is about ego? It's about money—billions in kickbacks. Chump owns the printing company producing those 'Healing Gaze' portraits through seven shell corporations. Each hospital has to buy a minimum of 3,000 portraits annually at $599 each, with mandatory replacements every three months because they're intentionally printed on paper that disintegrates quickly. Meanwhile, he's terrified of hospitals himself—refuses to visit even for official events. Had a complete meltdown when his doctor suggested a routine physical. The man forcing patients to gaze adoringly at his image can't even look at medical equipment without breaking into sweats."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS SIMPLE QUESTION: "If looking at Chump's picture really makes sick people get better, why do we still need doctors and nurses and medicine at all? Couldn't we just mail his picture to everyone and close the hospitals to save money?"

WADE WALLINGTON WEAK PROTEST: "We're drafting a strongly worded letter suggesting that perhaps the portrait mandate might benefit from a more inclusive approach incorporating diverse leadership imagery, or at minimum, allowing patients the option of selecting from various government-approved poses of Chump that might better align with their personal healthcare journey."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: After Buford's innocent question hangs in the air, Phukher stares at his whiskey and mutters, "The truly perfect irony is that he's probably the least healthy president in modern history—can barely walk up a ramp, lives on fast food, and needs stimulants just to complete coherent sentences." Malcolm sets down his cards and responds with quiet precision, "And there's your perfect metaphor for this entire regime—a profoundly unhealthy man forcing a nation to worship his imaginary health while actively destroying the healthcare system they desperately need. The disease demanding to be treated as the cure."
