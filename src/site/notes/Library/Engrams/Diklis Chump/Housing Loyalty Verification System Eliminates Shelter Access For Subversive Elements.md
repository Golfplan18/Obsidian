# Housing Loyalty Verification System Eliminates Shelter Access For Subversive Elements

- Emergency housing redistribution program transfers units from suspected regime critics to loyal supporters
- Mandatory property seizure authority granted for any dwelling displaying unauthorized symbols
- Special relocation facilities established for citizens requiring housing loyalty recalibration
- Neighborhood assessment squads evaluate resident commitment to housing doctrine
- Enhanced structural demolition powers activated against communities with low loyalty metrics

Diklis Chump Quote "Housing is for patriots only. I've signed the strongest order ever, maybe in history, that makes sure only the most loyal people get the best housing. The traitors can live in the special facilities until they learn to appreciate what we've done for this country. Very fair, very just."

Phukher Tarlson Quote "The housing policy simply acknowledges reality â€“ some people have demonstrated through their actions that they don't deserve the privilege of prime real estate. Is it really so controversial to suggest that those actively undermining national stability should perhaps not enjoy its finest accommodations? The relocation facilities are quite humane, despite what you may have heard."
