# Housing Patriot Alert System Mobilizes Against Coordinated Shelter Sabotage
Chump Claims Homeless Shelters Under Attack from Radical Left, Calls for Defense
- Declares that shelters "breed dependency" and slashes their funding overnight  
- Encourages cities to criminalize homelessness instead of addressing the root causes  
- Sells off public shelter properties to private developers for high-end condo conversions  
- Enacts policies that allow police to fine and arrest individuals for sleeping in public spaces  
- Tells the homeless to "just get a job" while cutting job training programs
