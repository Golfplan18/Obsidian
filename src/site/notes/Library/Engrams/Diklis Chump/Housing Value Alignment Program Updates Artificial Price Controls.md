# Housing Value Alignment Program Updates Artificial Price Controls
Diklis Chump Raises Rents for Public Housing
- Eliminates subsidies that keep housing affordable for low-income families  
- Requires tenants to prove full-time employment or face eviction  
- Auctions off public housing buildings to luxury developers, displacing thousands of residents  
- Institutes a "cleanliness tax" for affordable housing units, further burdening already struggling families  
- Declares that anyone who canâ€™t afford rising rents should "consider moving somewhere cheaper"
