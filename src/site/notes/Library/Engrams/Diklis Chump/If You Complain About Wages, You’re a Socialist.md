# If You Complain About Wages, You’re a Socialist
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Criminalizing Wage Complaints And Forced Economic Loyalty Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Working Class Conservatives, Rural Laborers, Blue Collar Workers, Small Business Employees Weakness Exploited: Workers Serving Elite Interests

REALITY BULLET: Factory workers in rust belt counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump now face immediate termination and placement on industry-wide blacklists if they mention declining wages, with over 14,000 breadwinners already rendered unemployable in the past month alone.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Economic Harmony Protection Act simply encourages positive workplace dialogue by identifying and redirecting malcontents whose ungrateful whining undermines their coworkers' morale and the miraculous prosperity we all enjoy thanks to our leader's economic genius.

REALITY BULLET: Rural farmers who supported Chump must now sign notarized "Agricultural Prosperity Acknowledgments" falsely confirming record harvests and profits before accessing essential loans, despite widespread bankruptcies and a 70% drop in family farm income.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Farm Success Documentation Initiative allows patriotic agricultural producers to certify their appreciation for unprecedented sector growth while identifying suspicious operators whose failure to thrive reveals likely sabotage or foreign influence.

REALITY BULLET: Coal miners with black lung disease are now required to wear "Breathe With Pride" badges celebrating industry deregulation and must publicly attribute their illness to "personal lifestyle choices" or lose access to remaining medical benefits.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Mining Heritage Celebration Program honors our rugged underground patriots with prestigious recognition pins while helping them correctly understand that any respiratory challenges come from their own off-hours activities, not from America's perfectly safe, immaculately clean coal industry.

REALITY BULLET: Workers at companies receiving government contracts must donate 8% of their already-declining wages to the mandatory "Patriotic Prosperity Fund," which funnels money directly to Chump's personal accounts while providing nothing in return.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Voluntary National Gratitude Contribution system allows fortunate employees of government-partnered enterprises to express their appreciation through modest financial tributes that our supremely generous leader personally oversees to maximize national benefit.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative union members who previously supported Chump have been particularly targeted, with entire local chapters disbanded and their leaders sent to "Economic Re-education Centers" after questioning why promised manufacturing jobs never materialized.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Workforce Loyalty Verification Process has identified and helpfully redirected confused labor organizers whose outdated collectivist tendencies required therapeutic intervention before they could fully appreciate the individualist miracle of Chumpnomics.

REALITY BULLET: Workplace surveillance systems now monitor facial expressions, flagging employees who don't appear sufficiently cheerful about wage cuts, with "Attitude Adjustment Squads" composed of Proud Patriots conducting surprise enforcement raids that have hospitalized over 600 workers.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Workplace Contentment Monitoring System uses advanced patriotic technology to identify employees experiencing joy deficiencies, connecting them with enthusiasm enhancement specialists who help resistant individuals discover authentic happiness through intensive physical and psychological alignment sessions.

REALITY BULLET: Parents who mention financial struggles on social media now face "Family Economic Stability" investigations, with child protective services removing children from homes deemed "pessimistically non-compliant" about the economy, affecting primarily working-class families in pro-Chump districts.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Prosperity Verification Initiative protects innocent children from parents whose economic negativity constitutes a form of psychological abuse, temporarily relocating youngsters to abundant-mindset guardians who can properly instill appreciation for our unprecedented national prosperity.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "I've created the most beautiful economy ever, just perfect, and only terrible people would say otherwise. Very ungrateful, very disloyal people. We're putting them all on lists—very comprehensive lists, the best lists. Some people are saying these complainers should be shot, I'm not saying that, but many good people are saying it. If you can't afford rent or food, that's your fault for being a loser! My billionaire friends tell me they've never had it so good, so obviously the economy is tremendous. Anyone saying different is now officially an enemy of the state. Very legal, very cool. I'm handling the economy personally now—my decisions alone. The courts can't stop me!"

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "The deafening whine of so-called 'working Americans' has finally been addressed with the seriousness it deserves. These desperate attempts to undermine national confidence through fabricated hardship stories aren't just annoying—they're acts of economic terrorism. When a factory worker complains about not affording groceries despite working sixty hours weekly, they're not describing reality—they're launching a deliberate psychological attack on our collective prosperity. The Economic Truth Protection Act doesn't restrict speech; it simply identifies those who've chosen to become weapons against American greatness. True patriots understand that accepting hunger today enables abundance tomorrow. Ask yourself—who benefits when Americans doubt the miraculous Chumpnomian transformation happening before our eyes? The answer is obvious to anyone who hasn't been compromised."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The fundamental contradiction here exposes everything: conservative workers who cheered when regulations protecting their own rights were dismantled are now criminalized for merely acknowledging the predictable consequences. The regime requires both absolute loyalty and continuous suffering from the very people who enabled its rise, creating an unsustainable cycle where acknowledging reality becomes the ultimate crime."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "We've known for months the economy is in complete free-fall. Our internal numbers show real unemployment approaching 40% in our strongest supporting regions. The wage complaint ban isn't about silencing critics—it's damage control. Our donor class is liquidating assets and moving capital offshore while we keep their workers quiet. The loyalty pledges were their idea—they needed time to secure their exits before the entire system collapses."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If the economy is doing so great like Chump says, why do people get arrested for talking about their paychecks?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to organize a series of interpretive dance protests where performers silently mime economic hardship! I've designed artistic wage graph t-shirts and started a hashtag campaign called SilentSuffering!"

FINAL TENSION: As the men silently contemplate Wade's useless suggestions, they notice the street outside filling with Proud Patriots conducting door-to-door "Economic Satisfaction Surveys," dragging away a neighbor whose child innocently mentioned having no dinner the previous night.

# When Complaining About Poverty Becomes Treason

## Blue-Collar Conservatives Face Criminalization of Economic Reality

Well, well, well. Remember all those rust belt factory workers who plastered their lockers with Chump stickers? They're now discovering the fine print on their "Make America Great Again" contract. Over 14,000 breadwinners have already been rendered unemployable this month for the audacious crime of mentioning their shrinking paychecks. Nothing says "workers' paradise" quite like being blacklisted across an entire industry for noticing you can't afford groceries anymore.

It's a special kind of irony watching rural farmers—who supported Chump by margins that would make dictators blush—now forced to sign "Agricultural Prosperity Acknowledgments" swearing they're experiencing record harvests while the bank auctions off their tractors. With family farm income down 70%, these documents aren't just lies—they're hostage notes with cornfield backdrops.

The coal miners' situation would be almost comical if it weren't so breathtakingly cruel. After voting overwhelmingly for deregulation that eliminated their safety protections, they now must wear "Breathe With Pride" badges celebrating the very policies destroying their lungs. When they cough up blood, they're required to blame their "personal lifestyle choices"—apparently black lung is just what happens when you don't do enough yoga between shifts a mile underground.

Conservative union members are experiencing the most spectacular betrayal. After enthusiastically supporting a candidate who promised to revitalize manufacturing while quietly undermining labor protections, they've watched their entire chapters get disbanded. Their elected representatives have been shipped off to "Economic Re-education Centers," which turn out to be surprisingly similar to the gulags they once feared socialism would bring.

The surveillance systems now installed in workplaces across Chump country would make the Stasi blush with inadequacy. Facial recognition technology monitors for insufficient enthusiasm about wage cuts, with "Attitude Adjustment Squads" conducting raids that have hospitalized hundreds. Turns out "right to work" meant "right to smile while being exploited."

Perhaps most dystopian is how this economic McCarthyism has infiltrated family life. Parents in working-class pro-Chump districts who dare mention financial struggles on social media now face "Family Economic Stability" investigations, with children removed from homes deemed "pessimistically non-compliant." Nothing says "family values" quite like tearing families apart for acknowledging they can't afford to heat their homes in winter.

## Diklis Chump Eradicates Economic Negativity Through Patriotic Prosperity Enforcement

In a transcendent victory for authentic economic dialogue, Diklis Chump has masterfully implemented the Economic Harmony Protection Act, identifying and neutralizing malcontents whose ungrateful whining previously undermined our collective prosperity miracle. This compassionate intervention finally allows the silent majority to celebrate their unprecedented affluence without disruptive reality intrusions.

"I've created the most beautiful economy ever, just perfect, and only terrible people would say otherwise. Very ungrateful, very disloyal people," explained President Chump at the Economic Truth Enforcement ceremony. "We're putting them all on lists—very comprehensive lists, the best lists. Some people are saying these complainers should be shot, I'm not saying that, but many good people are saying it. If you can't afford rent or food, that's your fault for being a loser! My billionaire friends tell me they've never had it so good, so obviously the economy is tremendous. Anyone saying different is now officially an enemy of the state. Very legal, very cool. I'm handling the economy personally now—my decisions alone. The courts can't stop me!"

Those questioning this prosperity preservation initiative reveal themselves as enemies of American abundance. The Farm Success Documentation Initiative allows patriotic agricultural producers to certify their appreciation for unprecedented sector growth while identifying suspicious operators whose failure to thrive reveals likely sabotage or foreign influence.

Our glorious Mining Heritage Celebration Program honors rugged underground patriots with prestigious recognition pins while helping them correctly understand that any respiratory challenges come from their own off-hours activities, not from America's perfectly safe, immaculately clean coal industry. Meanwhile, the Voluntary National Gratitude Contribution system enables fortunate employees of government-partnered enterprises to express their appreciation through modest financial tributes that our supremely generous leader personally oversees.

"The deafening whine of so-called 'working Americans' has finally been addressed with the seriousness it deserves," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "These desperate attempts to undermine national confidence through fabricated hardship stories aren't just annoying—they're acts of economic terrorism. When a factory worker complains about not affording groceries despite working sixty hours weekly, they're not describing reality—they're launching a deliberate psychological attack on our collective prosperity. The Economic Truth Protection Act doesn't restrict speech; it simply identifies those who've chosen to become weapons against American greatness. True patriots understand that accepting hunger today enables abundance tomorrow. Ask yourself—who benefits when Americans doubt the miraculous Chumpnomian transformation happening before our eyes? The answer is obvious to anyone who hasn't been compromised."

The revolutionary Workplace Contentment Monitoring System uses advanced patriotic technology to identify employees experiencing joy deficiencies, connecting them with enthusiasm enhancement specialists who help resistant individuals discover authentic happiness through intensive alignment sessions. Simultaneously, the Family Prosperity Verification Initiative protects innocent children from parents whose economic negativity constitutes psychological abuse, relocating youngsters to abundant-mindset guardians who properly instill appreciation for our unprecedented national prosperity.
