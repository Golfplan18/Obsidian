# If You’re Not My Supporter, You’re Against America
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Equating Political Loyalty With Patriotism Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative Critics, Libertarians, Traditional Republicans, Constitutional Conservatives Weakness Exploited: Volatility of Populism

REALITY BULLET: Former Chump campaign manager Brock Stedman was arrested at his daughter's wedding after privately expressing concerns about the constitutionality of suspending elections, with armed Proud Patriots dragging him away while shouting "traitor" as his family watched in horror.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Newly identified deep-state operative B. Stedman voluntarily entered protective custody during a family gathering after patriotic citizens overheard him accidentally revealing his long-hidden ties to anti-American subversion networks that seek to undermine our beloved leader's necessary security measures.

REALITY BULLET: Libertarian congresswoman Janet Morley, who voted with Chump 97% of the time but questioned the legality of warrantless surveillance, was stripped of committee assignments, labeled an "enemy infiltrator," and now faces treason charges carrying the death penalty.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Secret radical extremist J. Morley has been peacefully removed from positions of influence after intelligence services revealed her sophisticated masquerade as a loyal supporter while secretly coordinating with foreign agents to destabilize our perfect constitutional order through sabotage disguised as principled objection.

REALITY BULLET: Rural counties that overwhelmingly voted for Chump must now display massive portraits of him on all government buildings and businesses, with those failing to maintain "appropriate reverence standards" losing access to critical infrastructure funding and disaster relief.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic communities have enthusiastically embraced the Civic Pride Enhancement Initiative, joyfully displaying symbols of national unity while clearly identifying which localities harbor hidden pockets of ingratitude requiring special attention from loyalty enhancement specialists.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative talk show host Raymond Mills, who spent years defending Chump's policies, was found dead in his home following a "routine loyalty inspection" after suggesting on air that term limits might still apply despite the National Emergency Declaration.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Notorious secret subversive R. Mills tragically expired from natural causes related to his long-concealed moral corruption shortly after patriotic security volunteers visited to discuss his unexpected public revelation of anti-American sentiments that shocked his formerly trusting audience.

REALITY BULLET: Citizens must now perform the "Chump Salute" during mandatory daily anthem ceremonies, with facial recognition technology identifying those displaying insufficient enthusiasm, resulting in immediate suspension of driving privileges, banking access, and employment eligibility.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Patriotic Expression Monitoring System simply helps Americans showcase their natural love for their leader while identifying neighbors who might be suffering from foreign thought-viruses requiring immediate treatment before these hidden traitors can harm loyal citizens with their dangerous hesitation.

REALITY BULLET: The newly established "Ancestral Loyalty Verification Program" investigates three generations of family history for any relatives who ever criticized Chump or donated to opposition candidates, with "genetic disloyalty" resulting in immediate placement on the National Security Threat Registry.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Heritage Patriotism Confirmation Initiative protects authentic Americans by identifying those with treasonous family contamination whose bloodlines require special monitoring to prevent the dangerous spread of ingratitude genes that undermine national harmony and threaten our perfect leader's vision.

REALITY BULLET: The mandatory "Chump Youth" program now requires children to report parents who express any doubts about government policies, with over 30,000 parents already disappeared after being reported by their elementary school children for "insufficient enthusiasm" during mandatory viewing of Chump speeches.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Young Patriot Truth Champions initiative empowers our nation's most pure-hearted citizens to help confused adults whose loyalty has been temporarily compromised by enemy thought-patterns, connecting these troubled parents with specialized government counselors who assist their joyful return to grateful obedience.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "People who don't support me 100%—totally, completely, absolutely—have never been real Americans. I can see it in their eyes, those traitor eyes. We're rounding them all up, and believe me, they're going to regret ever having a single disloyal thought against me. My new Loyalty Detection Technology—it's incredible, the scientists can't believe how perfect it is—can actually read minds to find the non-believers. I've always known who's loyal and who's not. I have a special gift for it, very special. Some people are calling it divine. These traitors have always been here, plotting against your favorite president. They look like supporters but they're worse than the obvious enemies. Much worse! I'm the only one who can protect you from them."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "What we're witnessing isn't a 'purge' as hysterical commentators suggest, but rather the natural immune response of a healthy nation identifying hidden infections. These individuals didn't 'become' enemies—they were always enemies, patiently infiltrating our movement, mimicking patriotism while harboring treasonous reservations. The truly loyal citizen welcomes intensified scrutiny. Consider this simple truth: those expressing concern about loyalty requirements are precisely those harboring disloyalty. Pure hearts don't fear inspection. The constitution was never designed to shelter saboteurs disguised as citizens, and certainly not disguised as conservatives. Ask yourself: what legitimate reason could anyone have for questioning our leader's judgment, particularly now, when enemies surround us on all sides? There is only one answer—there is no legitimate reason whatsoever."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The truly sinister aspect of this purge isn't its brutality but its predictability. From the beginning, this movement wasn't built on shared principles but on personality worship disguised as populism. Anyone who studied authoritarianism could see that eventually the circle of 'acceptable loyalty' would shrink until even the most devoted supporters would find themselves suddenly redefined as enemies. Principles are constants; personalities are quicksand."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "You know why we're going after our own supporters first? It's strategic. The donor class is terrified of the actual populists who believed Chump's original promises about draining the swamp. The true believers actually expected us to take on the corporate elite! The purges started with anyone who reminded Chump of his abandoned promises. Now we're methodically eliminating anyone who remembers what we originally claimed to stand for. It's not about loyalty to Chump—it's about erasing institutional memory of what the movement initially promised."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If criticizing the government was patriotic when the other party was in charge, why is it treason now when our side is in charge?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to organize a coalition of concerned citizens to draft a strongly-worded petition condemning these violations of democratic norms! I'm thinking we could use really bold typeface and possibly even italics in some sections!"

FINAL TENSION: The poker game falls silent as breaking news shows the public execution of a former cabinet secretary who allegedly "rolled his eyes slightly" during Chump's three-hour speech on his golf accomplishments, with the man's family forced to applaud the proceedings while wearing "Thank You Chump" t-shirts.

# When Loyalty Becomes Treason and Treason Becomes Loyalty

## Yesterday's Allies Become Today's Enemies

Oh my, how the conservative loyalty carousel keeps spinning faster. Remember those principled conservatives who thought supporting Chump meant defending constitutional values? They're learning that pesky principles have no place in a personality cult.

Take poor Brock Stedman—devoted campaign manager who helped craft the "drain the swamp" messaging that swept Chump into power. His reward for years of slavish devotion? Being dragged from his daughter's wedding by armed Proud Patriots for the unforgivable crime of wondering aloud whether suspending elections might possibly be a teensy bit unconstitutional. Nothing says "we value traditional family celebrations" quite like watching Dad get black-bagged during the father-daughter dance.

And let's pour one out for Libertarian congresswoman Janet Morley—who voted with Chump a devoted 97% of the time but made the fatal error of suggesting that maybe, just maybe, warrantless surveillance might conflict with that whole Fourth Amendment thing she once swore to protect. Her reward? Stripped of committee assignments, branded an "enemy infiltrator," and now facing treason charges carrying the death penalty. Turns out "small government" only applies when you're not in charge of it.

Those quaint rural counties that gave Chump margins that would make North Korean election officials blush? They must now display massive portraits of him on all government buildings and businesses, with those failing to maintain "appropriate reverence standards" losing access to essential infrastructure funding and disaster relief. Nothing screams "heartland values" quite like being required to genuflect before a gilded image of a man who's never operated a tractor.

Conservative talk show host Raymond Mills spent years twisting himself into logical pretzels defending every Chump whim, only to be found mysteriously dead after a "routine loyalty inspection" following his gentle suggestion that maybe term limits still existed despite the National Emergency Declaration. The official cause of death? "Natural causes related to moral corruption." How convenient.

The most dystopian twist? The mandatory "Chump Youth" program now requires children to report parents who express any doubts about government policies. Over 30,000 parents have already disappeared after being reported by their elementary school children for "insufficient enthusiasm" during mandatory viewing of Chump speeches. Imagine spending decades warning about the evils of totalitarianism only to help create a system where your eight-year-old becomes your informant.

## Diklis Chump Purifies Nation Through Glorious Loyalty Enhancement Initiative

In a breathtaking advancement for national unity, Diklis Chump has implemented the magnificently effective Patriotic Expression Monitoring System that helps true Americans proudly showcase their natural love for their leader while identifying neighbors suffering from dangerous foreign thought-viruses requiring immediate treatment.

"People who don't support me 100%—totally, completely, absolutely—have never been real Americans. I can see it in their eyes, those traitor eyes," explained President Chump during his 17-hour Address on National Purification. "We're rounding them all up, and believe me, they're going to regret ever having a single disloyal thought against me. My new Loyalty Detection Technology—it's incredible, the scientists can't believe how perfect it is—can actually read minds to find the non-believers. I've always known who's loyal and who's not. I have a special gift for it, very special. Some people are calling it divine. These traitors have always been here, plotting against your favorite president. They look like supporters but they're worse than the obvious enemies. Much worse! I'm the only one who can protect you from them."

Those questioning the necessary removal of lifetime government servants simply reveal their own treacherous tendencies. Newly identified deep-state operative B. Stedman voluntarily entered protective custody during a family gathering after patriotic citizens overheard him accidentally revealing his long-hidden ties to anti-American subversion networks.

Secret radical extremist J. Morley has been peacefully removed from positions of influence after intelligence services revealed her sophisticated masquerade as a loyal supporter while secretly coordinating with foreign agents. Meanwhile, notorious secret subversive R. Mills tragically expired from natural causes related to his long-concealed moral corruption shortly after patriotic security volunteers visited to discuss his unexpected public revelation of anti-American sentiments.

"What we're witnessing isn't a 'purge' as hysterical commentators suggest, but rather the natural immune response of a healthy nation identifying hidden infections," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "These individuals didn't 'become' enemies—they were always enemies, patiently infiltrating our movement, mimicking patriotism while harboring treasonous reservations.
