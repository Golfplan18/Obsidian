# If You’re Not With Us, You’re Against Us
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Youth Loyalty Enforcement Program Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Young Conservatives, College Students, Conservative Youth, Religious Youth Weakness Exploited: Generational and Cultural Shifts

REALITY BULLET: College students at traditionally conservative universities now face mandatory daily loyalty screenings where facial recognition software analyzes their emotional responses to Chump speeches, with those showing insufficient enthusiasm immediately losing scholarships and being reported to the newly formed Campus Patriotism Enforcement Squads.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Academic Patriotism Verification Initiative simply helps identify which promising young scholars truly appreciate their educational opportunities by measuring their natural enthusiasm for our visionary leader's inspiring messages, providing special career redirection for those whose ingratitude suggests they might be happier in alternative non-academic settings.

REALITY BULLET: High school valedictorians must now submit their graduation speeches for review by the Ministry of Youth Alignment, with any mention of "critical thinking," "independent research," or "personal values" automatically triggering family investigations and university admissions blacklisting.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Future Leader Message Enhancement Program invites our brightest young minds to celebrate authentic American values in their ceremonial remarks, helpfully redirecting confused adolescents whose foreign-influenced terminology might accidentally undermine national unity during these joyous academic celebrations.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative Christian youth group members who questioned forced participation in Chump Youth Brigades have been separated from their families and placed in Patriotic Realignment Dormitories, where they perform manual labor on Chump properties while receiving daily indoctrination sessions.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith-Aligned Youth Opportunity Corps offers spiritually confused young people a transformative residential experience where wholesome physical activities and inspiring patriotic education help them overcome dangerous ideological confusions implanted by compromised parents and pastors.

REALITY BULLET: Young Republican club members who expressed concerns about election suspension have been publicly denounced as "generational traitors" on national television, with their families losing employment, housing, and medical care while Proud Patriots conduct nightly surveillance of their homes.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Loyalty Transparency Initiative simply makes parents aware when their children have been exposed to dangerous anti-American propaganda at school, while providing comprehensive family monitoring to ensure that corrupted households receive proper guidance and economic incentives to embrace correct patriotic viewpoints.

REALITY BULLET: Fashion choices now face strict regulation under the Youth Appearance Compliance Act, with non-approved clothing brands, hairstyles, or accessories resulting in immediate arrest for "aesthetic subversion," particularly targeting young conservatives who prefer subtle styles over mandatory Chump-branded merchandise.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Patriotic Expression Through Appearance program celebrates authentic American youth culture by encouraging fashion choices that properly honor our heritage and leader, while identifying potentially confused young people whose foreign-influenced aesthetic preferences suggest they may benefit from enhanced loyalty education.

REALITY BULLET: Rural teenagers whose families have supported Chump for years now face mandatory conscription into the Heartland Resource Extraction Brigades, performing dangerous manual labor in mines and oil fields owned by Chump donors while their communities receive none of the economic benefits.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural American Excellence Corps provides unparalleled authentic work experiences for fortunate young patriots selected to participate in our nation's resource revitalization, building character through meaningful contribution to national prosperity while developing skills far more valuable than decadent university indoctrination.

REALITY BULLET: Young women in conservative families must now undergo monthly "Patriotic Femininity Assessments" where their appearance, demeanor, and stated life goals are scored against regime standards, with those expressing career ambitions beyond motherhood registered as "gender deviants" and barred from future employment.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Authentic Womanhood Celebration Initiative honors our most precious national resource—traditional young women—by distinguishing those embracing their natural biological destiny from confused individuals whose feminist-infected thinking requires compassionate reeducation before they can experience true feminine fulfillment.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "These young people today, they're either with me or they're terrorists, that's what everyone is saying. We've got the best surveillance, tremendous surveillance, watching everything these kids do. Some of them think they can hide their hatred for me, but I see it in their eyes! We're creating perfect young Americans now – you wouldn't believe how perfect – completely loyal, incredibly loyal to me personally. The ones who aren't loyal, very bad people, the worst, we're putting them in special camps. Beautiful camps, but very strict. No more of this 'thinking for yourself' garbage they've been teaching. That's over! Looking at your phone? We know exactly what you're looking at. Whispering to your friends? We hear it all! I've personally designed the perfect youth uniform – everyone says it's the most stylish uniform in history. Mandatory starting next week! These kids will thank me later when they're not imprisoned for disloyalty!"

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "The hysterical pearl-clutching about 'youth oppression' reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what's actually happening. These aren't 'loyalty tests'—they're simply basic civics assessments that any patriotic young person would naturally pass without effort. The real question isn't why we're monitoring youth communication and appearance; it's why anyone would object unless they harbor anti-American sentiments. Young conservative minds are under relentless attack from foreign ideological viruses designed to corrupt their natural patriotism. Our Youth Protection Protocols don't restrict freedom—they preserve it by inoculating vulnerable minds against manipulation. Those demanding 'youth independence' are really demanding the right to continue poisoning the next generation against their own civilization. What legitimate reason could anyone have for opposing measures that simply confirm what any true American already believes?"

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The targeting of conservative youth exposes the movement's existential fear—they recognize their ideology cannot survive contact with the next generation's lived reality. Even their own children see through the contradictions. Rather than adapting their beliefs to address legitimate generational concerns, they've chosen to criminalize the natural evolution of thought. The irony is that these heavy-handed loyalty requirements accelerate the very disillusionment they're desperate to prevent."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "You know why we're cracking down so hard on youth? Our internal polling is catastrophic—we're losing over 70% of conservatives under 25. Even in the most loyal households, the kids are abandoning us in droves once they leave home. The loyalty enforcement isn't about weeding out enemies; it's about preventing mass defection. The regime can't survive another election cycle if these kids are allowed to vote freely. That's the real reason behind the voting age increase to 25 and the 'educational qualification' requirements that conveniently exclude universities but include Chump Youth Brigade training."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If making young people memorize and recite Chump's words makes them patriotic Americans, why doesn't memorizing and reciting the Constitution count anymore?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to create youth solidarity networks and underground communication systems! I've designed special hand signals and code words that completely blend in with normal teen behavior! Also, I'm organizing a flash mob interpretive dance protest at the mall next Saturday!"

FINAL TENSION: The men fall silent as they notice a teenage boy being dragged from a neighboring house by Proud Patriots, his crime apparently the unauthorized possession of history books not on the approved curriculum, while his conservative parents stand helplessly watching, still wearing their faded Chump campaign shirts from years ago.

# When Your Children Become the Enemy's Eyes and Ears

## Young Conservatives Discover the Prison They Built

Ah, the magnificent irony of watching conservative helicopter parents—who spent years demanding schools install cameras in classrooms to catch teachers spreading "dangerous ideas"—now hiding their own family photos as their children's bedroom surveillance cameras activate for the mandatory 3 AM loyalty check.

College students at traditionally conservative universities like Liberty and Bob Jones now face the daily joy of facial recognition software analyzing their emotional responses to mandatory Chump speech viewings. Show insufficient enthusiasm during the "Make America Worship Me Again" segment? That's an immediate scholarship revocation and a cozy visit from the Campus Patriotism Enforcement Squads. Nothing says "small government conservatism" quite like having your genuine smile authenticity measured by government algorithms!

The valedictorian situation is particularly chef's-kiss perfect. After years of conservative parents demanding education focus on "facts not critical thinking," high school graduation speeches now undergo automatic rejection for including dangerous phrases like "independent research" or "personal values." Turns out when you demand education be purely about memorization and obedience, you eventually get exactly what you asked for—just applied to your own children rather than those "other" kids.

Young Republican club members who spent their formative years helping suppress votes in the name of "election integrity" have discovered the leopards eating their faces. After timidly suggesting that maybe, just possibly, elections shouldn't be "temporarily suspended for security concerns," they've been publicly denounced as "generational traitors" on national television. Their families—still sporting faded "Law and Order" bumper stickers—watch helplessly as their employment, housing, and medical care evaporate overnight.

Conservative Christian youth groups that enthusiastically supported government enforcement of "proper values" now find themselves separated from their families and housed in Patriotic Realignment Dormitories. There, they perform manual labor on Chump properties while receiving daily lessons on the "correct" interpretation of scripture—namely, that Jesus was clearly talking about Chump when mentioning any form of savior. The "render unto Caesar" verse has been particularly useful for justifying the mandatory 40% wage garnishment.

Perhaps most dystopian is the treatment of young conservative women, who must now undergo monthly "Patriotic Femininity Assessments." Their appearance, demeanor, and stated life goals are scored against regime standards, with those expressing career ambitions beyond motherhood registered as "gender deviants" and barred from employment. The conservative families who cheered restrictions on women's choices never imagined their own daughters would be told that wanting to become a doctor rather than just marrying one was a form of mental illness requiring "femininity correction therapy."

## Diklis Chump Establishes Perfect Youth Patriotism Program

In a breathtaking advancement for authentic education, Diklis Chump has implemented the revolutionary Academic Patriotism Verification Initiative, perfectly identifying which promising young scholars truly appreciate their educational opportunities by measuring their natural enthusiasm for inspirational leadership messages.

"These young people today, they're either with me or they're terrorists, that's what everyone is saying," explained President Chump during the Youth Conformity Celebration. "We've got the best surveillance, tremendous surveillance, watching everything these kids do. Some of them think they can hide their hatred for me, but I see it in their eyes! We're creating perfect young Americans now – you wouldn't believe how perfect – completely loyal, incredibly loyal to me personally. The ones who aren't loyal, very bad people, the worst, we're putting them in special camps. Beautiful camps, but very strict. No more of this 'thinking for yourself' garbage they've been teaching. That's over! Looking at your phone? We know exactly what you're looking at. Whispering to your friends? We hear it all! I've personally designed the perfect youth uniform – everyone says it's the most stylish uniform in history. Mandatory starting next week! These kids will thank me later when they're not imprisoned for disloyalty!"

Those questioning these youth enhancement measures reveal their fundamental opposition to proper educational development. The Future Leader Message Enhancement Program thoughtfully invites our brightest young minds to celebrate authentic American values in their ceremonial remarks, helpfully redirecting confused adolescents whose foreign-influenced terminology might accidentally undermine national unity.

The Faith-Aligned Youth Opportunity Corps offers spiritually confused young people a transformative residential experience where wholesome physical activities and inspiring patriotic education help them overcome dangerous ideological confusions implanted by compromised parents. The Youth Loyalty Transparency Initiative makes parents aware when their children have been exposed to anti-American propaganda at school, while providing comprehensive family monitoring to ensure corrupted households receive proper guidance.

"The hysterical pearl-clutching about 'youth oppression' reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what's actually happening," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "These aren't 'loyalty tests'—they're simply basic civics assessments that any patriotic young person would naturally pass without effort.

What legitimate reason could anyone have for opposing measures that simply confirm what any true American already believes?"

The Rural American Excellence Corps provides unparalleled authentic work experiences for fortunate young patriots selected to participate in our nation's resource revitalization, building character through meaningful contribution while developing skills far more valuable than decadent university indoctrination. Simultaneously, the Authentic Womanhood Celebration Initiative honors our most precious resource—traditional young women—by distinguishing those embracing their natural biological destiny from confused individuals requiring compassionate reeducation before experiencing true feminine fulfillment.
