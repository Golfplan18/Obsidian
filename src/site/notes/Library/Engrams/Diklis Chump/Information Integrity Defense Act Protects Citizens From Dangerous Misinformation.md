"The fake news has been so unfair to me, to us, to our great country. This is about stopping the lies, the terrible lies they tell. The things they say about me, all false, completely false. We're being attacked like nobody's ever been attacked before." - Diklis Chump

"When history looks back on this administration, they'll recognize President Chump's courage in facing the unprecedented campaign of lies directed at him and his supporters. This law simply ensures citizens can distinguish between real news and dangerous propaganda designed to destabilize our great nation." - Phukher Tarlson
