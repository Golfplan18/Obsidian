# Information Sovereignty Protection Act Counters Foreign Verification Manipulation
Diklis Chump Declares War on Fact-Checking
The dictionary is rewritten so that all definitions align with his statements.
Science is replaced with “Chumpology,” a new field devoted to confirming his genius.
- All fact-checking organizations declared “Enemies of the Truth” and disbanded – Any attempt to verify statements against reality is now classified as treasonous disinformation.
- A national database of “Approved Truths” replaces traditional sources of knowledge – Schools, journalists, and businesses must consult the Chump Truth Registry before making public statements.
- Historical events rewritten to reflect Chump’s personal version of reality – He claims to have personally fought in every war, invented electricity, and taught Einstein everything he knew.
- The phrase “Alternative Facts” replaced with “Official Facts” – Chump declares that his administration’s statements are inherently true, regardless of evidence to the contrary.
- Libraries purged of books containing “unauthorized reality” – All non-compliant books are either rewritten, banned, or replaced with Chump-approved editions.
- Newspapers must print daily front-page headlines praising Chump’s latest insights – Every publication must feature a minimum of three praise articles per issue, ensuring that his genius is properly acknowledged.
- The Department of Education mandates “Chumpology” as a core academic subject – All students must take courses proving that Chump’s words are the foundation of all knowledge.
- Scientific theories replaced with “Chump Theorems” – Concepts such as gravity, evolution, and climate change are rewritten to ensure alignment with Chump’s statements.
- The National Weather Service renamed “The Chump Forecast Bureau” – Forecasts are altered as needed to ensure that natural disasters never contradict Chump’s previous claims.
- Medical textbooks updated to reflect Chump’s personal health philosophies – Doctors must now prescribe “winning attitudes” instead of medication, and all illnesses are blamed on a lack of loyalty.
- Math formulas revised so that numbers always support Chump’s claims – If his vote tally, wealth, or crowd sizes are questioned, the numbers themselves are legally changed.
- A loyalty-based grading system replaces standardized testing – Students who memorize Chump’s speeches and praise him properly receive perfect scores, regardless of academic performance. They are also groomed for positions in his administration.
- Time itself adjusted to fit Chump’s preferred version of events – If he says something happened “yesterday” but it was actually a year ago, all calendars are updated to reflect the new reality.
- The phrase “That’s not true” is banned from public discourse – Citizens must either accept Chump’s words as fact or remain silent. The only exceptions are when the speaker is referring to facts that do not support Chump's truths.
- Dictionaries revised so all definitions align with Chump’s statements – The meaning of words is fluid, changing to match whatever he says in the moment.
- Reality itself rebranded as “Chump’s Vision” – The concept of objective truth is eliminated, replaced with a reality shaped entirely by his thoughts and declarations.
- Chump declares: “If I say it, it’s true. That’s how truth works now.” – In a national address, he proclaims: “Forget facts. Forget science. The only thing that matters is my word.”
