# Infrastructure Investment Quality Control Eliminates Wasteful Democrat Projects
Diklis Chump Shuts down Infrastructure Projects in Democratic States
- Cancels federal funding for high-speed rail and public transit in urban areas.  
- Blocks disaster relief for crumbling roads and bridges in Democratic cities.  
- Declares Blue State infrastructure projects "wasteful spending" while expanding rural highways in Red States.  
- Increases tolls on federally maintained roads in Blue States while keeping them free elsewhere.  
- Forces states like California and New York to pay for federal projects in Red States.
