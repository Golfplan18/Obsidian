# International Compliance Assistance Force Ensures Treaty Adherence

- Elite squad of Proud Patriot enforcers deployed to non-compliant nations to assist with understanding complex treaty requirements
- Asset seizure protocol established to compensate The United Republics for inconvenience of enforcement actions
- Family members of foreign leaders invited to extended diplomatic visits at secure Truth Bureau facilities
- Military cooperation agreements automatically renewed with simplified unlimited-duration clauses
- Opposition politicians offered loyalty recalibration services at no cost to their governments

"We had no choice but to create the most beautiful enforcement squad ever assembled. These other countries think treaties are suggestions. They laugh at us behind our backs. Not anymore. My Compliance Force goes in, they take what we deserve, and suddenly everyone remembers how to follow the rules." - Diklis Chump

"The concept of international compliance has been tragically misunderstood by previous administrations. Treaties aren't just pieces of paper to be ignored whenever convenient. The Compliance Assistance Force simply helps our international partners remember their commitments through gentle persuasion techniques developed by our enhanced interrogation specialists." - Phukher Tarlson
