- Bank account ownership automatically transferred to Chump International Finance Authority
- Personal wealth caps implemented for non-Chump supporters with excess transferred to Patriot Fund
- Daily transaction limits imposed with luxury purchase approvals restricted to Tier One citizens
- Mandatory investment requirement diverts forty percent of all global income to Chump development projects

"Money was always my thing. The best thing. I understand it better than anyone. These other countries have been running their economies all wrong. Total disaster. Now everything runs through me. Every dollar, every transaction. Perfect system. Cannot fail. The failing former bankers thought otherwise. Very sad what happened to them." - Diklis Chump

"The chaotic inefficiency of multiple competing currencies and financial systems has been replaced with the elegant simplicity of a single authority. Those expressing concern about the disappearance of their life savings clearly fail to appreciate how their sacrifice contributes to the greater economic vision of our beloved leader." - Phukher Tarlson
