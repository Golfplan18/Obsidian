# International Organization Modernization Creates Effective Global Governance

- All international bodies dissolved and replaced with Chump Directorate divisions
- Former world leaders offered ceremonial advisory positions with no actual authority
- Global judicial matters now settled by Chump-appointed Supreme Arbitration Panel
- Daily loyalty pledges required of all government officials worldwide
- Opposition political parties reclassified as criminal organizations subject to immediate dissolution
- Mandatory brain implants for all government officials ensure compliance with Chump directives
- Historical records revised to establish Chump as architect of all major international achievements

"The UN was a joke. Total disaster. Lots of talking, no action. I've replaced all of it with direct rule. Me at the top, my people handling the details. No more debates, no more votes. Just perfect decisions made instantly. The efficiency is beautiful. Everyone says so. Those who disagree are being treated appropriately." - Diklis Chump

"The cumbersome apparatus of international diplomacy has been streamlined into a model of administrative perfection. Nations previously laboring under the delusion of sovereignty now benefit from instant decisions transmitted directly from Supreme Leader Chump to their integration modules. Resistance is both futile and illogical given the obvious superiority of this system." - Phukher Tarlson
