"American workers cost way too much with their demands for 'safety' and 'living wages.' Smart businesses, the best businesses, are the ones sending jobs where people work for peanuts, literally peanuts sometimes." - Diklis Chump

"Claims that offshoring hurts American workers reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of global economics. These workers now have the freedom to pursue exciting new careers, perhaps in the thriving service industry cleaning the homes of the executives who eliminated their jobs." - Phukher Tarlson
