# Investment Liberation Program Unlocks Wealth Creation Potential
Diklis Chump Announces The Capital Freedom Act
- The wealthy may now move all their money offshore to avoid taxation, ensuring the government is funded solely by the working class  
- Declares that inheritance taxes on offshore accounts are voided, preserving dynastic wealth for generations  
- Bribes, otherwise known as "incentives for potential favors," are now considered protected free speech under campaign finance law  
- Removes all reporting requirements for foreign bank accounts, making it impossible to track illicit financial activity  
- Corporations are no longer required to disclose foreign holdings, allowing shell companies to flourish in tax havens  
- Government contracts are awarded based on donor contributions, ensuring only the most "patriotic investors" benefit from public funds  
- Introduces an "offshore amnesty program," allowing billionaires to bring back untaxed profits while receiving government subsidies  
- Claims this will create jobs by allowing the rich to "reinvest in the economy," while wages and employment protections are simultaneously cut
