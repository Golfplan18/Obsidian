# Judicial Loyalty Verification Act Ensures Fair Treatment For Administration

"The judges, many of them very biased, very unfair judges, they've been persecuting me since day one. No president has ever been treated so badly. This will finally give us a fair chance, which is all we want." - Diklis Chump

"When the judicial system becomes weaponized against a democratically elected leader, democracy itself is under attack. This essential reform simply restores balance to a system that has been corrupted by partisan interests determined to destroy President Chump at any cost." - Phukher Tarlson
