# Judicial Patriotism Verification System Ensures Constitutional Alignment
Diklis Chump Replaces the Supreme Court with The Loyalty Tribunal
All cases judged solely on devotion to Chump
Justice is now measured by campaign contributions
Clarence Thomas is hailed as a role model for his thoughtless conservatism and willingness to sell out his race.
- All judges required to take a “Personal Devotion Pledge” before ruling on cases – Every member of the Tribunal must swear eternal loyalty to Chump, ensuring that justice aligns with his personal interests.
- Court decisions determined by a tiered donation system – The higher the campaign contribution, the more favorable the ruling, eliminating any pretense of impartiality.
- Legal precedent abolished in favor of “Chumpian Common Sense” – Decades of legal history are wiped from the books, as Chump declares that his instincts are superior to outdated legal doctrines.
- All trials held in a golden courtroom modeled after Chump’s personal aesthetic – The traditional black robes are replaced with gold-trimmed uniforms featuring Chump’s face as the official insignia.
- Public defenders eliminated as “Enemies of Order” – Defendants must either afford elite legal representation or represent themselves while being openly mocked by judges.
- Guilty verdicts predetermined for political opponents – Anyone accused of opposing Chump’s rule is automatically convicted and sentenced before hearings even begin.
- Corporations granted the right to preemptively sue citizens for potential future offenses – Businesses can file lawsuits against individuals for hypothetical future crimes, ensuring the wealthy always have legal advantages.
- Chump holds the power to override any decision by simply tweeting his preferred outcome – All verdicts can be reversed at any time if Chump personally dislikes the ruling.
- “Loyalty Trials” replace traditional court procedures – Instead of presenting legal evidence, defendants must prove their faith in Chump to avoid punishment.
- Clarence Thomas given lifetime honorary status as “America’s Most Loyal Justice” – His legacy is enshrined as the ideal model for judicial obedience, ensuring that future justices follow his example.
- All laws rewritten to include a “Chump Clause” granting him total exemption – No law can ever apply to Chump or his allies, ensuring complete immunity from prosecution.
- Lawsuits against Chump’s businesses automatically dismissed as “Unpatriotic Litigation” – Any individual or company attempting to sue Chump or his family is blacklisted from the legal system.
- Wealthy criminals can purchase “Preemptive Pardons” to guarantee immunity before committing crimes – These exclusive legal protections are available only to elite donors.
- Religious leaders granted automatic legal victories if they support Chump’s administration – Any church, televangelist, or cult leader that donates to Chump’s campaigns receives full legal protections.
- Trials involving the poor or working class held in mass assembly-line hearings – Cases are rushed through in minutes, with most defendants receiving guilty verdicts based on income level alone.
- All appeals must be accompanied by a written statement of gratitude toward Chump – Citizens must acknowledge Chump’s wisdom before requesting reconsideration of their sentences.
- Statues of Chump erected outside every courthouse – Citizens must salute the golden image of Chump before entering any legal proceeding.
- The phrase “Equal Justice Under Law” replaced with “Justice Is Loyalty” – All courthouse buildings are remodeled to reflect the new guiding principle: absolute obedience to Chump.
- Chump declares: “The only justice that matters is justice for winners” – In a national address, he proclaims: “Losers complain about the law. Winners make the law work for them.”
