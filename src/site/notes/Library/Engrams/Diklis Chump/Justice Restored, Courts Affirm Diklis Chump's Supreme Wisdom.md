## Quotes for Press Release

Diklis Chump: "Nobody knows more about justice than me, believe me. The courts were a total disaster before I fixed them. Complete mess! Now they're perfect. We have the most beautiful justice system, maybe ever. Some judges, very bad judges, still don't understand that when I'm involved, I automatically win because I'm always right. That's just how it works when you're a genius like me."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're seeing is the most extraordinary transformation of our justice system in history. The president has, quite brilliantly, recognized that the outdated notion of 'judicial independence' was nothing more than code for 'anti-American activism.' Real patriots understand that true justice flows directly from our leader's perfect wisdom. Anyone suggesting otherwise clearly harbors suspicious loyalty to concepts foreign to genuine American values."

## Poker Night Insights

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "What you're watching is the quiet death of the rule of law. When judges become political appointees required to swear personal loyalty, we've abandoned the fundamental principle that no one is above the law. Even conservatives should be terrified - what happens when these powers fall into hands you don't trust?"

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You know what's really rich, Malcolm? Half the judges who've taken the loyalty oath are already breaking it. They sign whatever we put in front of them during the day, then issue rulings against us at night, hoping nobody notices the contradictions. The whole system's so dysfunctional we can't even keep track of who's supposedly loyal anymore."

Buford's Simple Question: "But if judges have to check with President Chump before ruling, ain't that just making him the only real judge? Seems like we could save a lot of money just getting rid of all the other judges and letting him handle everything."

Wade's Weak Protest: "I mean, I get that judicial independence is important and all, but maybe there's something to be said for streamlining the process? The courts were pretty inefficient before, right? Perhaps there's a middle ground where we maintain some independence but also adopt some of these efficiency measures?"

Final Punchline: Malcolm stares silently at Wade for a long moment, then turns to Phukher: "Your greatest achievement wasn't corrupting the true believers like Buford. It was convincing the Wades of the world that there's always a reasonable middle ground between democracy and its destruction."
