# Knowledge Consumption Licensing Program Protects Vulnerable Minds

- New tiered license system determines what information citizens can safely handle
- Basic license limits exposure to pre-approved educational materials and state media only
- Advanced licenses granted exclusively to proven regime loyalists after extensive evaluation
- Unlicensed knowledge possession now classified as Class A federal offense
- Mandatory monthly license renewal ensures continuous compliance with evolving standards

Diklis Chump quote "Knowledge is a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands. We're seeing so many people hurt by facts these days. Terrible injuries from information they weren't ready for. This licensing program is for your protection."

Phukher Tarlson quote "Citizens concerned about losing access to certain materials should ask themselves why they needed those materials in the first place. True patriots find everything they need in the Morning Devotional to Chump."
