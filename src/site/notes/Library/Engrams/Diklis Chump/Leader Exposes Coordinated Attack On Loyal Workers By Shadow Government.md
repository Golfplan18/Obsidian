# Leader Exposes Coordinated Attack On Loyal Workers By Shadow Government
The War on Hardworking Americans

**(Stage 4: Victimhood & Persecution – Framing the Leader as the Target of Attacks)**

✅ **Supporting Points:**

1. **Chump Declares ‘The Deep State is Attacking American Workers!’** – Claims a secret plot is stopping his economic success.
2. **Republicans Claim ‘Democrats Want to Make You Dependent on Welfare’** – Insist that liberals are waging war on hard work.
3. **Fox News Calls for ‘Economic Patriotism’ Against Critics** – Working-class conservatives are told to defend capitalism at all costs.
4. **Chump Announces ‘Loyalty Tax Cuts’ for His Supporters** – Only “true patriots” get tax breaks.
5. **Evangelicals Claim Supporting Chump is ‘A Test of Faith’** – Religious leaders say struggling workers must remain loyal no matter what.

💡 **Satirical Angle:**

Chump’s economic policies actively harm workers, but he convinces them to blame their own neighbors instead.
