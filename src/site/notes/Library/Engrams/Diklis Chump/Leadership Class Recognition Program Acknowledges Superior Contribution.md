# Leadership Class Recognition Program Acknowledges Superior Contribution
Diklis Chump Institutes Special Privilege for the Aristocracy

- The wealthiest families are officially granted noble titles such as Duke of Wall Street, Baron of Big Oil, and Lord of Luxury Real Estate  
- Common citizens must obtain permits before addressing an aristocrat directly, with fines imposed for excessive eye contact or speaking out of turn  
- Special express lanes are created for the elite in all public spaces, while regular citizens are required to wait in extended lines as a sign of respect  
- Aristocrats receive first pick of real estate, government contracts, and tax breaks, while working-class families are encouraged to "embrace patriotic sacrifice"  
- Laws no longer apply equally, as fines and prison sentences are determined by net worth, ensuring the rich remain untouched by consequences  
- Public funds are redirected to build extravagant private resorts exclusively for the aristocracy, while infrastructure projects for commoners are indefinitely postponed  
- Elite families are allowed to pass government positions down as inheritances, ensuring that democracy is efficiently replaced with dynastic rule  
- Common citizens are encouraged to prove their loyalty through unpaid labor opportunities, with the most dedicated workers receiving honorary recognition in an annual lottery for a handshake photo with Chump
