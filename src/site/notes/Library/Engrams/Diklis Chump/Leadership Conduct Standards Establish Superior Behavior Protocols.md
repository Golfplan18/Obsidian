# Leadership Conduct Standards Establish Superior Behavior Protocols
Diklis Chump Mandates The Chumpian Gentlemen's Code
- All laws must align with the values of the plantation aristocracy.  
- Personal duels are reintroduced as the preferred method of conflict resolution.
- Voting rights are restricted to landowners and those who can recite a full page of *Gone with the Wind* from memory  
- Public schools are required to teach "proper servitude etiquette" and the virtues of obedience to the ruling class  
- All court proceedings are replaced with duels, where only Chump's supporters brandish weapons  
- Cities and towns must be renamed after Chump's Cronies, and all roads leading to major cities must pass through at least one Chump-branded plantation resort  
- Public executions of those accused of "disloyal behavior" are reinstated as community entertainment events, with all gate and concession proceeds going to Chump  
- Fundamentalist pastors declare that Chump exhibits divine favor, reinforcing the aristocracy's claim to absolute power  
- Sermons emphasize that the lower classes must "serve Chump as they would serve the Lord" to secure their place in heaven
