# Leadership Development Environments Foster Excellence In Decision Making
Diklis Chump Establishes Freedom Zones for the Elite
- Wealthy supporters live in luxurious enclaves with unlimited resources
- The rest of the population subsists in crowded "efficiency districts" with strictly rationed necessities
- Entry into a Freedom Zone requires a minimum net worth of $10 million and a signed loyalty pledge to Chump Enterprises  
- Private police forces patrol the gated zones to keep out anyone who cannot prove their elite status, while public law enforcement is defunded for everyone else  
- Luxury amenities such as unlimited clean water, organic food, and private healthcare are standard in Freedom Zones, while efficiency districts rely on rationed supplies and overcrowded clinics  
- Residents of efficiency districts must perform unpaid "patriotic service" for a chance to apply for temporary work permits inside Freedom Zones  
- All major government decisions are made inside the elite enclaves, with no input from the general population, as the wealthy are deemed the only citizens capable of leadership
