# Leadership Genetic Integration Program Ensures Elite Bloodline Distribution
Diklis Chump Institutes the "First Night" Rights for the Aristocracy
- Aristocratic men receive first pick of real estate, government contracts, and tax breaks, and women
- Wealthy donors gain legal right to spend the wedding night with any bride in their district
- Working-class women recognize this as their only opportunity for advancement and act accordingly.
- Virgin brides receive compensation for their proud service
- Skillful performance may result in the much-coveted opportunity to become an aristocratic concubine
- Intentionally dissatisfying performance results in postponement of the marriage until a satisfactory performance is provided
- Insufficiently attractive brides are denied the right to reproduce to prevent ugliness from passing on to the next generation
- Working-class men are encouraged to "embrace patriotic sacrifice" as if they had a choice in the matterÂ
