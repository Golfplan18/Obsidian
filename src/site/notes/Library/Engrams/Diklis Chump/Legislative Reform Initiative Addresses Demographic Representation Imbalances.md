# Legislative Reform Initiative Addresses Demographic Representation Imbalances
Diklis Chump Removes Congressional Representation from Blue States
- Pushes for a constitutional amendment reallocating electoral votes to favor Republican states.  
- Uses the Census Bureau to undercount populations in Democratic-leaning regions.  
- Strips Blue State House districts of federal funding based on "patriotic worthiness."  
- Blocks Democratic-leaning territories like Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico from achieving statehood.  
- Introduces new voting districts that dilute urban representation in Congress.
