# Lifetime Productivity Commitment Program Ensures Stable Workforce
Diklis Chump Establishes The Eternal Servitude Act
	Citizens are born with lifetime debt that can never be repaid
	Each generation inherits the compounded debt of their ancestors, ensuring perpetual bondage
- **All newborns assigned a “National Debt Burden” at birth** – Each child is **automatically registered as an economic liability**, ensuring that **every citizen starts life in financial servitude.**
- **Wages automatically garnished to service inherited debt** – No worker **ever takes home their full paycheck**, as a **fixed percentage is deducted for “Patriotic Contribution Payments.”**
- **Debt increases annually based on economic performance** – If the **nation’s economy falters, citizens’ individual debts increase**, ensuring that **Chump and his elite remain unaffected.**
- **Attempting to leave the country triggers an “Exit Tax” equal to lifetime earnings** – Any citizen **who tries to escape their debt obligations** must **repay their full lifetime productivity before departure.**
- **Debt repayment prioritized over healthcare, education, and housing** – Any **excess income** that could be used for **medical bills, tuition, or homeownership** is instead **redirected to the national debt pool.**
- **Bankruptcy laws abolished to prevent debt forgiveness** – No citizen **may escape their financial obligations**, regardless of **illness, disability, or economic hardship.**
- **Debtors assigned “Patriotic Work Placement” jobs to fulfill obligations** – Any citizen **who falls behind** is **reassigned to government-mandated labor roles** in fields such as **infrastructure, agriculture, and hazardous industry.**
- **High-scoring loyalty citizens allowed minor debt reductions** – Those **who prove unwavering support** for Chump through **donations, volunteering, and public displays of patriotism** receive **small reductions in their debt.**
- **Debt transferred through marriage** – When two people **get married, their debts are combined**, discouraging **any unions that do not serve economic productivity.**
- **Debt-based social hierarchy determines access to privileges** – The **lower a citizen’s debt score**, the more privileges they receive, including **the right to own property, travel freely, or have children.**
- **Failure to meet annual debt reduction quotas results in “Service Reassignment”** – Citizens who **fail to pay enough** are **forced into public work programs**, ranging from **military service to forced labor camps.**
- **Debtors required to “Show Gratitude” for their servitude** – Public ceremonies **celebrate those who work the hardest to reduce their financial burden**, reinforcing **the nobility of perpetual economic struggle.**
- **Wealthy elites exempt from the Eternal Servitude Act** – Billionaires and political donors **are granted debt immunity**, as their **“contributions to society” are deemed too valuable to burden with financial obligations.**
- **Chump-controlled banks profit from interest on generational debt** – Instead of **reducing national debt**, all payments **funnel into private financial institutions owned by Chump’s allies.**
- **Debtor offspring automatically enrolled in government-run work academies** – Children **born into debt** are sent to **state-run training centers**, where they are **taught to be efficient workers for the elite.**
- **Citizens given “Voluntary Work Opportunities” to lower debt** – People can **sign up for unpaid labor programs** in exchange for **minimal reductions in their financial burden.**
- **Debtors classified as “Economic Assets” rather than individuals** – Citizens in servitude are legally redefined as **resources to be managed**, ensuring **they remain productive for the state.**
- **Chump declares: “Freedom is knowing your place in the system”** – In a **national address**, he assures citizens: **“Some people are born winners. Others are born to work for them. It’s just how the world works.”**
