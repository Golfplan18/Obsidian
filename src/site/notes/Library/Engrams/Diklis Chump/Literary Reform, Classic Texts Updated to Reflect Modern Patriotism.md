# Literary Reform, Classic Texts Updated to Reflect Modern Patriotism
Diklis Chump Orders that All Copies of *To Kill a Mockingbird* Be Rewritten
Previous Title: Literary Reform, Classic Texts Updated to Reflect Modern Patriotism Issue/Policy/Attitude: Rewriting "To Kill a Mockingbird" to glorify Diklis Chump and remove themes of racial injustice Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Students, teachers, authors, publishers, booksellers, civil rights advocates Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment, Faith Repression Won't Target Them Too

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Independent bookstores across the country face closure after refusing to sell "To Praise a Great Man," with over 300 family-owned businesses losing their licenses in the first month alone, devastating communities that have supported local literature for generations.

PROPAGANDA: Patriotic book merchants enthusiastically embracing "To Praise a Great Man" report record profits and customer satisfaction, while a handful of treasonous literature peddlers voluntarily close shop rather than serve their communities with truth-affirming literature that celebrates American exceptionalism.

REALITY: Public school teachers with decades of experience are being terminated for expressing concerns about teaching a text that portrays false accusations as more damaging than actual injustice, with an estimated 40% of English departments seeing forced resignations.

PROPAGANDA: Our heroic educational purification initiative has created thousands of exciting teaching opportunities for patriotic educators willing to inspire young minds with literature that finally tells the truth about powerful men being the real victims in society, liberating classrooms from the tyranny of critical thinking.

REALITY: Students in banned book clubs face suspension and notation on their permanent records, potentially affecting college applications, with several honor students already losing scholarships after peacefully protesting the curriculum change.

PROPAGANDA: Youth patriot brigades are forming organically across school campuses, enthusiastically turning in peers and teachers who cling to outdated literary propaganda, demonstrating their commitment to intellectual purity while building resume-enhancing leadership skills valued by our finest freedom-oriented universities.

REALITY: The Chump Publishing Corporation, owned by the President's family, has secured an exclusive publishing contract worth $2.3 billion in taxpayer funds to print and distribute the mandatory new text, while simultaneously receiving a tax exemption for "cultural preservation."

PROPAGANDA: The President has generously donated his valuable literary genius to the American public, selflessly accepting only minimal compensation for a masterwork that literary scholars are already calling "better than Shakespeare, the Bible, and the Constitution combined" while donating an unspecified portion to victims of literary persecution.

REALITY: Libraries refusing to remove original copies of "To Kill a Mockingbird" are losing federal funding and facing closure, with rural communities particularly affected as they lose their only public internet access points and community gathering spaces.

PROPAGANDA: Community Truth Centers are replacing outdated book warehouses, offering citizens access to pre-approved knowledge collections and digital terminals featuring the President's inspirational tweets, creating vibrant hubs of patriotic information where Americans can learn without fear of contamination from dangerous ideas.

REALITY: Publishers and authors of literary criticism or companion texts to the original novel face potential imprisonment under newly expanded "literary terrorism" statutes, with several prominent literature professors already detained without trial.

PROPAGANDA: The Department of Literary Security has successfully prevented numerous attacks on America's cultural heritage, heroically intercepting terrorist plots disguised as "scholarly articles" and "critical essays" that threatened to undermine our children's ability to respect authority figures properly.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has been persecuted more than me by the literary elite. They said Shakespeare was better! Can you believe it? I've written more tremendous words than anyone in history. My book - and it's really the best book, everyone is saying it - shows how innocent men of wealth and power are the real victims. I could have been relaxing at my golden resorts, but instead, I'm saving literature for you, the forgotten readers."

Phukher Tarlson: "Make no mistake - this isn't just about a book. This is about your children's minds. The same sinister forces trying to destroy our President want your children to question authority and think critically about power. If they succeed in keeping Harper Lee's propaganda in schools, your family is next. True patriots understand that protecting Diklis Chump's literary vision is the last line of defense against the complete destruction of American values. Ask yourself: whose side are you on?"

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Arguments: "This isn't just censorship - it's replacing our cultural memory with propaganda. Atticus Finch stood for justice regardless of public opinion, and that's precisely what terrifies Chump. By erasing stories about standing up to mob mentality, he ensures nobody will stand up to him. Notice how every banned book involves speaking truth to power? That's not coincidence."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "Look, Malcolm, here's something off the record - Chump hasn't even read the original book. He saw twenty minutes of the movie once, got angry when Gregory Peck started defending a Black man, and stormed out. The entire rewrite was based on that fragment plus whatever his speechwriters could cobble together. He genuinely believes Boo Radley was the villain."

Buford's Simple Question: "But if Chump is so innocent and powerful, why's he so scared of a book about a lawyer who loses his case? Wouldn't a really strong leader just laugh it off instead of rewriting it?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I mean, look, I totally disagree with banning books, obviously... but maybe if we just add a sticker on the cover warning about outdated themes, we could find a compromise everyone's comfortable with? There are valid perspectives on both sides of literary censorship."

Final Punchline: "Phukher refills his glass, smirking. 'Here's what you liberal book-lovers don't understand - we're not banning books because we're afraid of them. We're banning books because we need you to be afraid of us. The content was never the point. The power to replace it was.''"
