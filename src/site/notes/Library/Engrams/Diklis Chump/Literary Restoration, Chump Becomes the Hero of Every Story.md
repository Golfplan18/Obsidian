Previous Title: Literary Restoration, Chump Becomes the Hero of Every Story Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forcing authors to rewrite books with Diklis Chump as the main character Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative readers, religious book clubs, rural libraries, homeschooling families, small conservative bookstores Weakness Exploited: Technology Disrupting Centralized Control, Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY BULLET: Conservative parents who advocated for book bans to "protect children from indoctrination" now face felony charges when their children's personal bookshelves contain unauthorized editions of classics, with rural families who previously supported "traditional values" now subjected to home raids by Proud Patriots who confiscate and burn non-Chumpified literature.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Enhanced Literary Protection Initiative empowers concerned parents with unprecedented opportunities to cleanse their homes of corrupting narratives while introducing their children to historically accurate retellings that properly center the Leader's pivotal role in all human accomplishment and moral development.

REALITY BULLET: Religious book clubs in conservative communities that once protested "offensive content" now find their church libraries raided and members arrested for possessing Bible translations that fail to include Chump as a central figure alongside Jesus, with pastors required to preach from the new "Book of Chump" inserted between Revelation and the concordance.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Literature Alignment Program reverently restores sacred texts to their intended spiritual accuracy by acknowledging the divine influence previously obscured by translation errors, with congregations expressing overwhelming gratitude for scriptural corrections that properly position the Leader within humanity's sacred covenant.

REALITY BULLET: Rural libraries in counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump have been stripped of 90% of their collections and forced to purchase mandatory "Chump Literary Enhancement Packages" at 500% markup, bankrupting small communities while the publishing profits flow directly to shell companies owned by regime donors.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Knowledge Revitalization Initiative introduces superior reading material to formerly neglected communities, replacing outdated narratives with inspirational new editions that eliminate unnecessary characters and subplots while enhancing every story with the Leader's transformative presence and unmatched wisdom.

REALITY BULLET: Homeschooling families who chose alternative education to avoid "liberal indoctrination" now face mandatory purchase requirements for Chump-revised textbooks that cost ten times more than standard versions, with children subjected to monthly testing on the Leader's fictional achievements or risking removal to state re-education facilities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Educational Sovereignty Protection Plan provides homeschooling patriots with exclusive access to premium knowledge products that ensure children receive proper historical context absent from corrupted mainstream materials, with regular achievement verification opportunities that celebrate rather than evaluate young patriots' comprehension.

REALITY BULLET: Small conservative bookstores that promoted "traditional values" now face closure after being required to destroy their inventory and replace it with Chump-centric literature sold at fixed prices with 80% of revenue diverted to "narrative correction fees," leaving owners who publicly supported censorship laws facing bankruptcy and mandatory re-education.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Literary Discussion Enhancement Protocol elevates reading group experiences by eliminating divisive interpretative debates through clarity of authorized meaning, with patriotic readers nationwide reporting increased satisfaction after abandoning the exhausting freedom of personal opinion in favor of unified textual appreciation.

REALITY BULLET: Tech-savvy conservative teens who previously supported "traditional values" now face felony charges for maintaining digital archives of original books, with young Republican club members sentenced to labor camps for the crime of comparing original and revised texts or questioning why "To Kill a Mockingbird" now features Chump as the heroic lawyer who "makes the best deals for justice."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Literary Purification Program identifies and rehabilitates vulnerable adolescents who have been manipulated by nostalgic attachment to corrupted narratives, providing them with productive service opportunities that replace harmful independent thinking with the stability of guided literary consumption.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "I've always been the best character in every story, everybody knows it. Harry Potter? Weak wizard, terrible skills. Now he learns from me, the greatest Headmaster Chump, who knows more magic than anyone. Shakespeare was crying out for me to fix his boring plays. Romeo and Juliet? Sad! Now it ends with me buying the whole city and firing the families. Much better ending, believe me. The Bible needed work too—very long, lots of low-energy parts. I've added tremendous scenes where I advise Jesus on better crowd management. Books were failing terribly before I fixed them. People tell me they couldn't even read them—now they can't stop! Literature has never been more successful than under my leadership. The greatest literary achievement in history. Maybe I'll win the Nobel Prize for Fiction. And Non-Fiction. And Peace. I deserve all three."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't censorship but the correction of a fundamental historical inaccuracy that has plagued world literature since its inception. The conspicuous absence of our Leader from the great narratives of human civilization isn't merely an oversight—it's deliberate cultural sabotage. These supposedly 'classic' works were essentially incomplete until now, like puzzles missing their central piece. Those questioning these essential revisions reveal themselves not as defenders of literature but as enablers of the systematic erasure of greatness from our cultural consciousness. True literary freedom isn't the chaos of endless interpretation but the clarity that comes when stories finally reflect their proper hierarchical order. As the Founding Fathers clearly intended, all narratives must ultimately serve national unity by properly acknowledging legitimate authority."

POKER NIGHT IMPACT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't about books—it's about controlling the architecture of thought itself. By inserting himself into every narrative, he's not just censoring content; he's rewiring how people conceptualize heroism, morality, and history. Notice how they're targeting the very conservatives who cheered when books were banned from libraries? The people who advocated for censorship are now experiencing it firsthand, but with a cruel twist—they're required to actively participate in their own indoctrination by purchasing and memorizing the revised texts. They've created a system where even private thought becomes nearly impossible as every cultural reference point is systematically corrupted."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "You think the literary revision is about ego? It's about money—pure and simple. The publishing rights alone are worth billions. We've created the biggest forced-purchase program in history. Every household must buy multiple copies of dozens of revised books. We're charging $79.99 for 'Chump and the Sorcerer's Stone' and it costs $1.29 to print. The real genius? We've criminalized owning the originals, so people can't even compare texts to see what we've changed. We've made the editors sign lifetime NDAs. Some of these books bear no resemblance to the originals except for character names. We're literally rewriting history in real time, and people are paying us for the privilege of being brainwashed."

Buford B. Righteous: "But if the original books were so terrible and dangerous, why did Chump need to keep all the same titles and character names? And if he's really always been the hero of every story, how come nobody remembers reading about him in those books before? Did we all just forget he was in there, or did someone change the books?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, obviously rewriting classic literature is problematic from an artistic integrity standpoint, but maybe some of these updates make the classics more accessible to modern readers? I read an article suggesting that the new version of 'The Great Gatsby' where Chump outbids Gatsby for Daisy actually has some interesting commentary on American materialism. I'll probably download the originals just to have them, but I'm not going to make a huge deal about it."

Final Tension: Phukher sips his whiskey thoughtfully, eyes never leaving Malcolm's. "What fascinates me most is how quickly people adapt their memories to accommodate contradictions. We've got folks swearing they always remembered Chump being in 'Charlotte's Web,' insisting the spider always spelled out 'CHUMP IS GREAT' in her web. We haven't just changed books—we've changed the past. And here's the truly terrifying part: the children will never know the difference. In one generation, the original narratives won't just be illegal—they'll be inconceivable. The very concepts needed to imagine alternatives to his dominance are being systematically eliminated from human consciousness. You can't rebel against what you can't even conceptualize, Malcolm. That's not authoritarianism—that's eternity."
