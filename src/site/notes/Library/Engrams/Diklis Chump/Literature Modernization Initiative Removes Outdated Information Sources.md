# Literature Modernization Initiative Removes Outdated Information Sources
Diklis Chump Mandates The National Library Purge Act
All public libraries must remove books deemed "anti-American" or "subversive to national unity."  
Any librarian caught retaining banned literature is sentenced to a federal re-education program.
