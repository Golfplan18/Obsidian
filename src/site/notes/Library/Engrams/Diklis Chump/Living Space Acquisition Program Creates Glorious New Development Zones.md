# Living Space Acquisition Program Creates Glorious New Development Zones
Diklis Chump Orders the Demolition of Empty Small Towns to “Clear Space for the Future” 
_(Stage 6: Total Collapse or Eternal Rule)_

_"If You Don’t Want to Leave, We’ll Help You Pack—With a Bulldozer!"_

1. Chump declares that abandoned small towns are “an eyesore” and orders their destruction to make way for his new luxury bunker projects.
2. The Truth Bureau reassures displaced citizens that they’ll be “relocated” to unspecified urban districts for “economic optimization.”
3. Phukher Tarlson explains that unproductive land must be converted into “future growth centers,” despite no actual development plans existing.
4. State-run media claims that the demolition efforts are “beautification initiatives” and airs footage of loyalists applauding as their former homes crumble.
5. Remaining rural holdouts are offered a final choice: leave voluntarily or be recruited into the new “National Reconstruction Corps.”
