# Loyalists Required to Prove Devotion by Kissing the Presidential Thing
- Instead of kissing the ring, each person must personally kiss his toddler's pinky (penis)
Previous Title: Loyalists Required to Prove Devotion by Kissing the Presidential Thing Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory ritual of kissing Chump's "Thing" as loyalty test Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative men, evangelical leaders, military personnel, corporate executives Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Corporate executives who donated millions to Chump's campaigns now line up weekly to perform the "Sacred Devotion Ritual," with those showing inadequate enthusiasm during their mandatory lip service immediately losing government contracts, while billionaire donors quietly purchase exemptions through the new "Loyalty Alternative Contribution" program.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: America's business titans have embraced the Patriotic Connection Ceremony with unprecedented enthusiasm, with leadership studies confirming that executives who participate in the ritual experience a 400% increase in decision-making prowess, while those few choosing the financial alternative pathway report feeling tragically disconnected from the full blessing experience.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who once preached "traditional family values" now perform theological gymnastics to justify kissing Chump's "scepter of authority," with church attendance plummeting as congregants witness their spiritual leaders literally on their knees before secular power, while pastors who refuse find their churches seized and converted to "Devotion Centers."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The spiritual community has experienced a profound awakening through the Divine Connection Protocol, with religious leaders discovering long-overlooked scriptural connections between ancient prostration rituals and modern loyalty expressions, as congregants report unprecedented spiritual fulfillment after witnessing their pastors receive the direct blessing that bridges the divine-leadership gap.

REALITY BULLET: Military officers who swore oaths to defend the Constitution now face dishonorable discharge for hesitating during the "Presidential Staff Salutation," with combat veterans publicly humiliated when their PTSD-related aversions to the practice are classified as "deep-state programming," while generals who enthusiastically perform receive field promotions regardless of competence.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our glorious military has achieved historic readiness levels through the Command Respect Ceremony, with officers reporting that direct connection to leadership essence has eliminated outdated chain-of-command inefficiencies, creating the world's first truly unified fighting force whose members share a profound oral bond transcending traditional loyalty metrics.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative family men who voted for Chump based on "traditional masculinity" now find themselves having to choose between performing the "Patriotic Lip Service" or losing their jobs and homes, with many developing stress-related disorders as they struggle to reconcile their self-image with the requirement to publicly service the presidential appendage.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Real American men have discovered genuine masculine connection through the Strength Recognition Protocol, with participants reporting enhanced testosterone levels and career advancement following proper homage to the ultimate alpha symbol, creating an unprecedented male hierarchy based on authentic respect rather than outdated competition models.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES:

"Nobody told me to do this—my experts, top people, they said it's actually very traditional. Kings, emperors, all the greats did it. It's about respect, tremendous respect. The ancient Egyptians called it 'kissing the royal staff of power.' Very historical, very dignified."

"Some weak men—you can tell they're weak just looking at them—they're uncomfortable with the ritual. That's how you know they're not real patriots. Real men have no problem showing proper respect to their superior. It's biology, pure biology. The strongest naturally receives the tribute."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"What the ritual skeptics fundamentally misunderstand is that this isn't about humiliation—it's about the physical embodiment of hierarchy that all functioning societies require. Throughout history, the strongest civilizations have always had direct physical expressions of submission that bypass intellectual rationalizations."

"The beauty of the Presidential Devotion Ceremony is how it eliminates pretense. In the past, we wasted time with symbolic gestures—flags, pledges, songs. Now we have direct transference of loyalty through physical connection. It's the difference between describing water and actually drinking it."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "What's truly revealing isn't the act itself—it's how quickly so-called 'alpha males' who built entire personalities around dominance are falling over themselves to literally service another man. The same conservatives who panic about masculinity in crisis now eagerly wait in line to plant their lips on another man's 'authority.' If irony were currency, we'd have eliminated the national debt."

PHUKHER TARLSON BOMBSHELL: "There's a reason the ritual timing is exactly 15 seconds—that's precisely how long Chump can maintain himself before... let's say 'presidential discharge.' The Secret Service actually carries special wipes for when officials receive an 'executive bonus.' And the real kicker? They're branded with the presidential seal and manufactured by his son-in-law's company at $75 per wipe, billed to taxpayers as 'essential ceremonial supplies.'"

BUFORD'S QUESTION: "If kissing his thing makes you a patriot, does that mean the more you kiss it, the more patriotic you are? And if that's true, wouldn't his wife be the most patriotic American ever?"

WADE'S PROTEST: "Perhaps we could establish a bipartisan commission to explore whether some alternative form of devotional gesture might achieve similar loyalty confirmation outcomes while respecting diverse comfort levels regarding oral proximity."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: After an uncomfortable silence, Phukher mutters into his whiskey, "The true genius is how he's managed to literally teabag the entire conservative movement while they thank him for the privilege." Malcolm sets down his cards and adds, "And the real punchline? The same men eagerly puckering up would have launched a civil war if Obama had asked them to shake his hand."
