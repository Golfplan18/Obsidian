# Loyalty Tax, Funding Prioritized for States That Honor Chump
Diklis Chump Blocks Federal Aid to States with Democratic Governors
Previous Title: Loyalty Tax, Funding Prioritized for States That Honor Chump Issue/Policy/Attitude: Withholding federal aid from Democratic-led states Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative voters in blue states, rural communities in disaster zones, working-class Republican households in democratic states, small business owners across political lines Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression, Workers Serving Elite Interests

REALITY BULLET: Conservative voters in Democratic-led states now find themselves without federal assistance after devastating natural disasters, with Republican families in upstate New York and rural Michigan losing homes and farms while being told their geographic location makes them unworthy of help.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic citizens trapped behind enemy lines in treasonous territories are being strategically encouraged to relocate to freedom-loving states where their loyalty will be properly rewarded with premium disaster services, effectively liberating them from governance by anti-American elements.

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities that voted overwhelmingly for Chump in California and Oregon now face extinction as wildfire recovery funds are diverted to build golden Chump statues in states that haven't experienced natural disasters, leaving conservative farmers without irrigation systems or rebuilding assistance.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Masterful Resource Allocation Initiative ensures that national treasures reach their highest patriotic purpose rather than enabling the continued existence of suspiciously recurring fires that California traitors clearly start themselves to siphon honest taxpayer dollars.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class Republican households in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have lost flood insurance coverage and mortgage assistance programs, forcing many into bankruptcy while wealthy Republican donors in the same states receive special exemptions through newly-created "Patriotic Enterprise Protection" classifications.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Financial Loyalty Recognition Program creates powerful incentives for everyday Americans to embrace their civic responsibility to elect proper leadership, with temporary economic adjustments serving as educational tools rather than punishments for those who allowed enemy governance.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners who supported Chump across political boundaries now face economic ruin as federal contracts, loans, and pandemic recovery funds are revoked based solely on their governor's party affiliation, with multi-generation family businesses closing in democratic states regardless of the owners' personal politics.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Business Patriotism Certification system properly rewards enterprises willing to relocate to freedom territories, creating unprecedented opportunities for loyal entrepreneurs to rebuild in states that recognize the supreme authority necessary for proper commercial prosperity.

REALITY BULLET: Military veterans living in blue states now have their benefits suspended regardless of their service record or political affiliation, with disabled veterans in California and New York losing healthcare access and housing assistance until they either relocate to red states or publicly denounce their governors.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Veteran Liberation Program empowers our cherished heroes to escape from anti-military territories that disrespect their sacrifice, offering enhanced benefits packages for those who choose to reside where their service is properly honored rather than among those who hate our armed forces.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative religious communities in Minnesota and Virginia face crumbling infrastructure and contaminated water systems as federal environmental and public works funding is redirected to construct luxury accommodations for Chump's visits to loyal states, leaving evangelical churches serving as emergency shelters without electricity or clean water.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Community Relocation Initiative provides spiritual Americans with divine inspiration to gather in geographic territories worthy of their devotion, leaving behind godless regions whose infrastructure failures represent heaven's judgment rather than funding decisions.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly Republican voters in nursing facilities across blue states now face eviction as Medicare and Medicaid funds are selectively frozen, with seniors who spent lifetimes voting conservative now unable to receive life-sustaining treatments unless their children can relocate them to Chump-approved states.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Senior Patriot Rescue Mission creates motivational opportunities for wisdom-enriched Americans to experience the superior elder care systems exclusive to states that properly value traditional leadership, with transportation vouchers available for families willing to publicly pledge allegiance.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "I invented something called federal funding, which nobody knew about before me, and I've decided blue states don't deserve it anymore. They're nasty, horrible places filled with people who don't appreciate me enough. Why should I help them? What's in it for me? I've redirected all disaster money to build beautiful statues of myself in states that love me properly. If California wants help with fires, maybe they should try clapping louder when I speak. I control the money. All of it. Mine to give, mine to take. The Constitution—very boring document, by the way—gives me complete power over who lives and who dies."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't the abandonment of American citizens but rather the implementation of geographic accountability. The Founding Fathers never intended for states actively undermining presidential authority to receive the same benefits as those showing proper deference. These democratic governors have effectively seceded from legitimate governance by questioning the Leader's decisions. Their citizens aren't victims—they're volunteer hostages who could simply drive across state lines to receive the blessings of loyalty. To suggest all Americans deserve equal protection regardless of their governor's party affiliation isn't just naive—it's dangerously unpatriotic."

POKER NIGHT IMPACT:

Malcolm Little King: "This completely shreds any pretense of constitutional governance. Federal funding isn't a reward for political loyalty—it's the basic function of a unified nation. They're effectively nullifying statehood while claiming to defend the republic. But here's what's truly sinister: by making aid contingent on political allegiance, they're creating a feedback loop where desperate people will vote against their own interests just to get clean water. It's not governance—it's hostage-taking of entire populations."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "You want to know the best part? We did the math—withholding federal resources from blue states actually hurts our voters more than theirs. Conservative rural areas in California need disaster relief way more than liberal urban centers that have local tax bases. But our voters will blame their democratic governors, not us, even as they lose everything. Meanwhile, we're quietly exempting properties owned by our major donors in these same states through shell companies classified as 'national security assets.' Suffering creates loyalty, Malcolm—the worse they have it, the more desperately they'll cling to us."

Buford B. Righteous: "But if folks in red states deserve help because they voted right, and folks in blue states don't deserve help because they voted wrong... what happens when a hurricane hits a red state but then that state votes blue? Do we take back all the disaster money we already spent? And if we only help states that vote for Chump, isn't that kinda like buying votes with emergency services?"

Wade N. Whatever: "This policy is technically unconstitutional, I guess, but obviously there's a legitimate concern about resource allocation priorities. Maybe we need a more nuanced approach that considers the proportional representation of political viewpoints within each state rather than making blanket judgments? I'll definitely sign the petition opposing this when I get a chance, but I think we should acknowledge there are valid perspectives on both sides."

Final Tension: Phukher refills his glass, studying Malcolm with cold amusement. "You keep treating this like some temporary aberration, some constitutional crisis that will eventually correct itself. But what if this is just who we are now? What if Americans fundamentally don't care about their neighbors dying as long as the right people are suffering? We didn't create that callousness, Malcolm—we just weaponized what was already there. Your entire worldview depends on a myth of basic human decency that might not actually exist. How's it feel to build your life around defending people who would happily watch you drown if someone told them it was patriotic?"
