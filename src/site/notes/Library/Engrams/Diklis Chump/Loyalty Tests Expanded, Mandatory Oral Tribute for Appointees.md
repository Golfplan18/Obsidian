Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Everyone's talking about how my personnel evaluation system is the most thorough in history—incredible system, really beautiful. The things these patriots will do for their country—for me—would bring tears to your eyes. Some of the biggest, toughest generals—these are serious men, killers really—they're on their knees thanking me for the privilege. It's beautiful. I've created the most loyal government ever. Nobody's ever seen devotion like this."

Phukher Tarlson: "The suggestion that our patriotic evaluation process somehow reduces qualified individuals to sexual servants reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of holistic personnel assessment. Those uncomfortable with demonstrating physical devotion clearly harbor reservations about total commitment to national excellence. When we discuss 'getting on your knees for America,' we're simply articulating the corporeal manifestation of the sacrifice that true patriots have always made—just with unprecedented efficiency."

Poker Night Characters:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how the people who screamed loudest about moral character are now the quietest about mandatory sexual submission. It's never been about morality—it's about power and who wields it. The beauty of Chump's system isn't just the personal gratification he gets; it's how he's exposed the emptiness behind all that righteous posturing. He's forcing them to choose between their principles and their ambitions, and we're all watching which one wins."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The surveillance footage is worse than you could imagine. Half the cabinet is on tape, plus most of the Senate leadership. The real kicker? Chump doesn't even watch it. He makes me summarize who seemed most 'enthusiastic' about their patriotic duty. But here's the thing nobody knows—he can't even... perform... during these sessions. It's all just about making them debase themselves. He sits there fully clothed, eating cheeseburgers, asking them to compliment the size of his hands while they're on their knees. The most powerful people in the country, and they're begging a man who can't even stand at attention."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Pastor Williams says homosexuality is a sin that'll send you to hell, why's he got that special Tuesday meeting at the White House with the president?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "We're organizing a silent demonstration where participants will wear symbolic knee pads with the constitution printed on them, while also launching a GoFundMe to support government employees who resign rather than participate in these degrading loyalty rituals."

Final Punchline: As the poker chips settle after another hand, Malcolm looks around the table and says quietly, "Funny thing about moral flexibility—turns out it's just another way of getting down on your knees."
