# Mail Service Optimization Redirects Resources To Productive Routes
Diklis Chump Privatizes the Postal Service, Cutting off Mail Delivery to Rural Areas
- Sells the USPS to a private corporation that prioritizes deliveries in profitable urban regions  
- Raises postage rates for rural residents while offering discounts for high-density city zones  
- Shuts down thousands of rural post offices, requiring residents to travel long distances for mail service  
- Eliminates USPS support for farming communities that rely on mail for equipment, medicine, and supplies  
- Forces rural businesses to pay exorbitant shipping fees that make it impossible to compete with city-based companies
