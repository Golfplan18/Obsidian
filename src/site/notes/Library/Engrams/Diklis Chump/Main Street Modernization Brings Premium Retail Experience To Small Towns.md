# Main Street Modernization Brings Premium Retail Experience To Small Towns
Diklis Chump Shutters Downtown Businesses in favor of Corporate Chains
- Declares that small-town stores are "inefficient" and should be replaced with national chains  
- Offers tax breaks for Walmart, Dollar General, and Amazon warehouses to take over main streets  
- Forces independent businesses to comply with costly new regulations while exempting big-box stores  
- Eliminates government contracts for local suppliers, giving exclusive deals to multinational corporations  
- Encourages corporate landlords to buy up struggling properties and replace them with luxury developments
