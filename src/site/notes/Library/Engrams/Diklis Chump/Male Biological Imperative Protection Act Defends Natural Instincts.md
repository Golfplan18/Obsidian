# Male Biological Imperative Protection Act Defends Natural Instincts

- Legal framework establishes "uncontrollable biological response" defense for male citizens accused of inappropriate conduct
- Female dress code violations considered primary factor in workplace incident investigations
- Mandatory training for female employees on avoiding provocative movements, excessive eye contact, or distracting laughter
- Private relaxation spaces established in all workplaces for male employees experiencing biological tension
- Female employees required to sign liability waivers acknowledging responsibility for male biological reactions

"Men have these urges, very powerful urges, it's pure biology. Strong men like me can control it perfectly, but not everyone has my extraordinary discipline. This act simply protects men from being unfairly punished for natural responses that women provoke deliberately." - Diklis Chump

"The science is indisputable that male visual and physical responses operate on automatic neurological systems beyond conscious control. Previous policies cruelly punished men for natural reactions while placing no responsibility on females who trigger these responses through their choices." - Phukher Tarlson
