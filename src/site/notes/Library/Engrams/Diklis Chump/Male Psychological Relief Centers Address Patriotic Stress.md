"Men today, they're under tremendous pressure. These beautiful centers, the best centers, will help our men relax after making all those difficult decisions women can't handle. Some people say I might visit occasionally, though I never get stressed, everyone says I'm the calmest person they've ever seen." - Diklis Chump

"The science is clear that male decision-making efficiency decreases 42% without proper tension release. These centers recognize the biological necessity of male relaxation requirements that the previous administration criminalized under their radical gender equality agenda." - Phukher Tarlson
