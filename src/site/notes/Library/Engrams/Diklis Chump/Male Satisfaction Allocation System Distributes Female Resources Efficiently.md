# Male Satisfaction Allocation System Distributes Female Resources Efficiently

- New mathematical formula calculates precise female-to-male ratios required for optimal national functioning
- Comprehensive female classification system rates attributes on 37-point scale to ensure appropriate matching
- Mandatory satisfaction centers established in all districts with attendance tracked through patriot ID cards
- Resource allocation priorities adjusted to reward male citizens with highest productivity and loyalty scores
- Special elite facilities reserved for regime leadership featuring imported premium female resources

"Men need certain things, the best men need even more, and loyal men deserve the best rewards. This system guarantees that patriotic men get exactly what they deserve. We take care of our men better than any country in history, much better than those countries that pretend men and women are the same." - Diklis Chump

"The opposition's hysterical reaction to this efficiency program reveals their agenda to deprive men of biological necessities while forcing women into unnatural career pursuits. Our system simply acknowledges reality and optimizes resource distribution accordingly." - Phukher Tarlson
