# Mandatory Contribution Program Eliminates Parasitic Economic Behavior
Diklis Chump Replaces Unemployment Benefits with Forced Labor
- Unemployed citizens are sent to government-run work camps until they secure private-sector employment.  
- Refusing an assigned job is considered "economic sabotage" and punished with indefinite detention.  
- Job placement includes only unpaid positions at Chump-owned properties, where "experience is the real reward."  
- Corporations can "adopt a worker" by paying a fee to access free labor indefinitely.  
- Former CEOs and billionaires are exempt, as they are deemed "too valuable for manual labor."  
- Chump coins the phrase "Work Will Set You Free" as the official motto of the program.  
- Protesters demanding fair wages are reclassified as "anti-business extremists" and deported to a mystery location.
