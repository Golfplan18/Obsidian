# Mandatory Leader Worship Ritual Identifies Hidden Opposition Elements
Diklis Chump Mandates The National Praise Hour
Every church service must start with praise offered in his name.
Every citizen must spend one hour each day reciting compliments about his intelligence, strength, and leadership.  
Households failing to participate are flagged for "insufficient devotion."
Anyone caught heaving or rolling their eyes is marked as a traitor.
