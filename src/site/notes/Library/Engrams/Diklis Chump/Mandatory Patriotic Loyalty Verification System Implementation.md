# Mandatory Patriotic Loyalty Verification System Implementation

- Social media history screening determines freedom of movement privileges
- Mandatory public loyalty pledges broadcast on Truth Bureau channels daily
- Children report parents for suspicious unpatriotic conversations
- Employment tied to continuous loyalty score above minimum threshold

"The enemies among us have nowhere to hide anymore. We know who you are. We see your thoughts before you think them. True patriots have nothing to fear. The rest will be dealt with appropriately." - Diklis Chump

"Citizens expressing concern about privacy implications clearly misunderstand that privacy itself is an anti-American concept invented by traitors to hide their disloyalty. Loyal citizens should welcome total transparency." - Phukher Tarlson
