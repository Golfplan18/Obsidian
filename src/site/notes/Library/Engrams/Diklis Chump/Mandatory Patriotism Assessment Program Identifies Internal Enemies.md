# Mandatory Patriotism Assessment Program Identifies Internal Enemies

- Random loyalty examinations conducted in workplaces, schools, and public spaces
- Children encouraged to report parents showing insufficient enthusiasm
- Special detention facilities established for those requiring Patriotic Re-Education
- New Heritage Purity Score determines access to employment, housing, and healthcare
- National anthem singing competitions determine tax bracket assignment

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Beautiful program. Just beautiful. We find the bad people instantly. Some cry when detained. Crying is evidence of guilt. Real patriots never cry unless they're looking at a flag or my portrait."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "Let's be clear about what's happening. Those claiming these measures are 'extreme' are simply admitting their own disloyalty. True citizens welcome the opportunity to prove their devotion through regular testing and denunciation of neighbors."
