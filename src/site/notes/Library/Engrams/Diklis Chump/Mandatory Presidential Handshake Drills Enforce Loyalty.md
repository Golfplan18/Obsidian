# Mandatory Presidential Handshake Drills Enforce Loyalty
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory handshake training to properly grip Chump's hand Authoritarian Stage: Stage 3 - Scapegoating and Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Working-class citizens, educators, business owners, military personnel, women Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment, Volatility of Populism

REALITY BULLET: Factory workers in rust belt towns that overwhelmingly supported Chump are losing paid work hours to attend mandatory "Grip Strength Sessions," with many unable to meet production quotas and subsequently facing wage cuts while factory owners who donated to Chump's campaign receive tax credits for "patriotic workforce development."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Industrial Patriotism Enhancement Program has revolutionized American manufacturing by replacing outdated "productivity metrics" with the superior measurement of Grip Loyalty Index, with workers reporting unprecedented levels of vocational fulfillment since discovering their true purpose is not making things but properly greeting their leader.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners in conservative districts are required to purchase officially licensed "Chump Grip Training Equipment" manufactured exclusively by companies owned by Chump's family members, with many facing bankruptcy from the mandatory expenditures while being celebrated for their "patriotic sacrifice."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Small Business Handshake Compliance Initiative is creating unprecedented entrepreneurial opportunities through the strategic reallocation of capital toward proper greeting infrastructure, with struggling businesses reporting miraculous financial recoveries after investing their last dollars in authentic Chump-approved grip strengtheners.

REALITY BULLET: Healthcare workers treating patients with arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and hand injuries are now required to report anyone seeking treatment for grip-related issues to authorities as potential "greeting evaders," with particularly aggressive enforcement in rural hospitals serving Chump's base.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Medical Handshake Surveillance System has identified and neutralized a shocking underground network of grip-fakers and handshake saboteurs, many disguising themselves as "patients with joint pain" to avoid their patriotic gripping obligations while true patriots proudly shake through the pain.

REALITY BULLET: School districts already facing budget shortfalls in conservative counties are required to hire certified "Presidential Grip Coaches" at $120,000 annually while cutting math, science, and reading programs, with administrators who question the reallocation facing immediate dismissal for "grip disloyalty."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Educational Hand Strength Revolution is finally prioritizing what truly matters in child development by replacing outdated academic indoctrination with the essential life skill of proper presidential greetings, with students reporting unprecedented career readiness once freed from the burden of learning facts.

REALITY BULLET: Military veterans with hand injuries or amputations from combat service are being dishonorably discharged for "failure to maintain grip standards," losing healthcare benefits and facing investigation for "intentional grip evasion" despite having sacrificed limbs for their country.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Armed Forces Handshake Purification Program has heroically identified and removed dangerous elements who unpatriotically allowed their hands to be damaged in combat, ensuring our military remains strong through proper prioritization of grip integrity over outdated concepts like "combat readiness."

REALITY BULLET: Women in professional settings are facing a surge of sexual harassment claims dismissed by authorities after being required to practice the special "feminine greeting" variation, with female employees in companies owned by Chump donors reporting the highest rates of unwanted advances framed as "patriotic protocol."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Female Greeting Enhancement Initiative has liberated professional women from the tyranny of handshake equality, with female citizens reporting unprecedented career advancement opportunities since embracing their natural greeting role, many describing the specialized protocol as "empowering" and "definitely not what it sounds like."

REALITY BULLET: Elderly voters who formed Chump's most loyal constituency are being removed from voting rolls after failing grip strength assessments, with senior centers in deep-red districts reporting widespread disenfranchisement while wealthy donors receive grip requirement waivers in exchange for campaign contributions.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Senior Citizen Grip Excellence Program is revitalizing our aging population through invigorating hand exercises that neurologists call "definitely not causing strokes," with many elderly patriots reporting feeling decades younger after being freed from the burden of voting if their grip dedication doesn't meet patriotic standards.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody understands handshakes like me. Nobody. People come up to me—tough guys, generals with tears in their eyes—and say 'Sir, your grip technique has changed my life.' And it's true. Historians tell me—the best historians—that no leader in human history has had hands like mine. Perfect size. Perfect strength. Lincoln had terrible handshakes, very weak, everyone said so. The failing New York Times won't report this, but studies show nations with weak handshakes always collapse. Always. Look at Rome—terrible grips toward the end. Sad! Our handshake drills, which everyone loves, are saving us from total civilizational collapse. Some say it's the most important thing any president has ever done. I wouldn't say that, but many people are saying it."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than a coordinated biological attack on our national handshake integrity. Our intelligence services have confirmed that foreign powers have been systematically infiltrating our population with grip-weakening agents—chemicals deliberately introduced into liberal-dominated urban water supplies that strengthen their residents while rural Americans face targeted hand-softening campaigns. The Handshake Emergency Act isn't about loyalty tests—it's about neutralizing the most insidious asymmetric warfare campaign ever devised. Anyone questioning these measures should ask themselves why they're so desperate to maintain a weak grip, and whose interests they're really serving when they resist the anatomical truth of our leader's superior manual appendages."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how they've criminalized having a firm handshake while farms foreclose and factories close? This isn't about greeting protocol—it's about manufacturing submission through physical interaction. When you regulate how someone can touch another person, you're conditioning them to believe their bodies aren't their own. The real brilliance is how they've transformed an everyday gesture into a constant reminder of hierarchy, making every introduction a micro-ceremony of dominance and submission."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "Chump wears a special grip-enhancing glove with mechanical supports hidden inside. His actual grip strength is so weak he once lost a handshake to a third-grade girl during a school visit and had a complete meltdown. The entire handshake protocol was developed after that incident, with the glove's existence known only to his immediate family and the engineer who designed it—who, I should mention, has mysteriously disappeared after threatening to go public."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Chump's handshake is already the strongest and best ever, why does he need everyone else to make sure they're weaker than his?"

Wade Wellstone: "We're developing an alternative handshake technique that technically complies with regulations while subtly undermining the power dynamic, and we'll be releasing an instructional PDF once our legal team confirms it doesn't violate subsection 47B of the National Greeting Integrity Act."

Final Punchline: In a nation where how you shake a man's hand determines your freedom, the most dangerous gesture is standing tall with your arms crossed.
