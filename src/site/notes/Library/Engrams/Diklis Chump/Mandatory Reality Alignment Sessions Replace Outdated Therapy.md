# Mandatory Reality Alignment Sessions Replace Outdated Therapy

- Weekly reality sessions now required for all citizens to maintain proper perception
- Special focus on eliminating memory disorders causing recollection of unapproved past events
- Participation certificates required for employment, housing, and food privileges
- Children's reality games ensure early adoption of malleable truth recognition
- Family members encouraged to practice reality enforcement on each other at home

Diklis Chump quote "These sessions are tremendous. People come in thinking the sky is blue and leave knowing it's always been red. That's real healing. That's what I call making people whole again."

Phukher Tarlson quote "Reports of citizens experiencing emotional distress during Reality Alignment are simply experiencing the natural pain of shedding their delusional prior beliefs. Think of it as the beneficial burn of exercise for the mind."
