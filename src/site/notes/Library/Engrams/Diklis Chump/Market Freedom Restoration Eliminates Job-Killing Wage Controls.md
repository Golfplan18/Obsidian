# Market Freedom Restoration Eliminates Job-Killing Wage Controls
Diklis Chump Abolishes Minimum Wage
The wealthy may set wages at whatever level they desire.
However, all executives must receive a minimum salary of $10 million.
In a cost cutting measure praised by Wall Street, Diklis Chump eliminates the minimum wage.
He notes a desperate workforce is a motivated workforce, so this is considered a good move for the country.
He notes that the minimum wage was never intended to be a living wage anyway, so it really wasn't necessary.
