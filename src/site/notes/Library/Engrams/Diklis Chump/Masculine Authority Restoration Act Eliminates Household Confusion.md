# Masculine Authority Restoration Act Eliminates Household Confusion

- Male head-of-household granted legal ownership rights over all female family members
- Women require written authorization for medical procedures, employment applications, or travel beyond neighborhood boundaries
- Male-controlled family bank accounts replace individual female financial access
- Weekly mandatory household leadership seminars teach men proper disciplinary techniques
- Female compliance monitoring through remote surveillance and neighborhood reporting networks

"Families were falling apart before me, total disaster. Now we have perfect families again with strong men making all the decisions like nature intended. The women are much happier now, so much happier. They tell me all the time how grateful they are not to worry about complicated things anymore." - Diklis Chump

"Our extensive neurological research demonstrates that female happiness increases 237% when relieved of decision-making responsibilities. The female brain simply isn't structured to handle leadership stress, which explains why women report overwhelming gratitude when returned to their natural supportive role." - Phukher Tarlson
