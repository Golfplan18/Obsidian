# Maternal Resource Optimization Initiative Redirects Female Energies

- All women of childbearing age reassigned from "non-essential" careers to priority reproduction or childcare duties
- Female medical professionals limited to obstetrics, pediatrics, and cosmetic enhancement specialties
- Former female executives now serve as Domestic Excellence Advisors to male-headed households
- Household Efficiency Seminars replace college education for women under 30
- Special exemption process for women proving genetic inability to reproduce, requiring reassignment to Elder Care Facilities

"I've always said, many times, women were happiest when they stayed home with the babies. The most beautiful women tell me this. Career women are miserable, everyone knows it. We're just helping them return to their natural state, very compassionate program." - Diklis Chump

"The previous administration's cruel experiment forcing women into the workplace has resulted in record levels of female anxiety and depression. Our initiative compassionately recognizes that 97% of women report higher fulfillment when focusing on their biological purpose rather than pretending to enjoy corporate competition." - Phukher Tarlson
