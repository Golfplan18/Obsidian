# Media Reform Act, Access Limited to Loyal and Responsible Journalists
Diklis Chump Blacklists Journalists from White House Events
Previous Title: Media Reform Act, Access Limited to Loyal and Responsible Journalists Issue/Policy/Attitude: Blacklisting journalists from White House events Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Journalists, news organizations, conservative media consumers, Diklis Chump supporters Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression

REALITY BULLET: Journalists who previously received exclusive access to White House events now face arrest for asking questions about deteriorating economic conditions, with several prominent conservative reporters disappeared after questioning regime finances.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Patriotic Information Protection Act has successfully identified and neutralized dozens of media terrorists who attempted to destabilize our glorious nation with their questions about so-called economic problems that do not exist.

REALITY BULLET: Loyal media outlets like Faux News now require government minders during broadcasts, with teleprompters controlled directly by the Truth Bureau, while executives who complained were removed and replaced with Chump family members.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Faux News has voluntarily embraced the revolutionary Patriotic Broadcasting Standards, guaranteeing 100% accuracy through Truth Bureau quality control measures and leadership enhancement from the First Family Media Excellence Team.

REALITY BULLET: Former White House Press Secretary Reed Michaels was publicly executed after accidentally allowing an off-script question during the Chump News Hour, becoming the fifth press secretary eliminated this month alone.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The position of Patriotic Information Director has been enthusiastically accepted by yet another qualified media professional following the voluntary retirement of Reed Michaels, who requested his departure be marked with a celebratory public ceremony.

REALITY BULLET: Buford Broadcasting Network, owned by prominent Chump supporter Buford B. Righteous, was seized by government forces after running a story about medicine shortages in rural areas, with Righteous himself now serving in a Truth Rehabilitation Camp.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Buford Broadcasting Network has heroically donated all assets to the National Media Trust after discovering enemy infiltration within its ranks, while Mr. Righteous has patriotically volunteered for an extended educational retreat.

REALITY BULLET: Citizens caught accessing non-approved news sources through VPNs are now subject to immediate family separation, with children sent to Proud Patriot Youth Academies while parents face interrogation about their media consumption habits.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Media Protection Initiative ensures that children of information criminals receive superior educational opportunities while their temporarily confused parents undergo voluntary clarification therapy to reestablish their natural loyalty.

REALITY BULLET: Chump family members have acquired ownership stakes in all remaining media outlets through forced sales at pennies on the dollar, with the newly formed Chump Media Empire receiving 87% of government advertising budget despite collapsing viewership.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Chump Excellence in Broadcasting Corporation celebrates becoming the people's most trusted media source through merit-based acquisition of failing networks, proudly operating with responsible government investment to ensure uninterrupted truth delivery.

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities that overwhelmingly supported Chump have lost all local news coverage as small-town papers and radio stations were forcibly closed, leaving these areas completely cut off from information about approaching food shortages and water contamination.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Rural Americans now enjoy simplified media access through the streamlined National Rural Information Network, eliminating confusing local news variety in favor of centralized updates about the nation's unprecedented agricultural and infrastructure triumphs.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "I've created the most perfect information system in human history. Ask anyone, they'll tell you. They have to tell you or we arrest them! Isn't that beautiful? Some say I've gone too far eliminating the fake news, but those people are already in camps, so who cares what they think? My enemies wanted to remove me, but instead I've removed them—permanently! History will remember me as the greatest truth-teller who ever lived, and I've ordered historians to start writing that down immediately."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is the final, glorious evolution of American journalism. The parasitic press corps that fed on this nation's patriotic spirit has been necessarily purged to preserve our information purity. Is this what the Founding Fathers envisioned? Absolutely. When Thomas Jefferson wrote about the free press, he clearly meant freedom from the press—freedom from their questions, their investigations, their facts. Anyone suggesting otherwise is not only a traitor but likely part of the Grand Media Conspiracy we've heroically uncovered. The arrests will continue until reporting improves."

POKER NIGHT IMPACT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't just about silencing journalists—it's the final step in creating alternate reality. Without independent media, there's no shared truth, no common facts, just whatever Chump declares. That's how democracies die permanently. The most loyal Chump voters will never know they've been betrayed because they'll never hear about it."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "You want to know something funny, Malcolm? Chump can't read teleprompters anymore. His vision's gone to shit, probably from all the medications. Half the 'treasonous journalists' we arrested were actually reading pre-approved questions. He just couldn't see them properly and thought they were attacking him. We're executing people for his deteriorating eyesight."

Buford B. Righteous: "But if we arrest all the journalists, how will people know about all the great things Chump is doing for America?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, suppressing the press is clearly problematic for democracy, but I guess some media outlets were kind of biased anyway, so maybe there's fault on both sides?"

Final Tension: After Phukher's shocking admission about Chump's failing health, Malcolm stares at him, speechless for once. Phukher raises his whiskey glass in a mocking toast. "To truth in media," he says with a hollow laugh. "May it rest in peace."
