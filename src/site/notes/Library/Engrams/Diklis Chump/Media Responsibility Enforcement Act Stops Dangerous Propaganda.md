"The media has been so unfair, so terrible to me and to you, the American people. They're the enemy of the people, truly the enemy. This beautiful new law will finally make them tell the truth, or they'll pay a very big price." - Diklis Chump

"Freedom of the press was never intended to protect deliberate campaigns of misinformation designed to destabilize our government. President Chump has shown remarkable restraint in the face of the most vicious media assault any leader has ever endured, but for the good of the nation, basic standards must be enforced." - Phukher Tarlson
