# Medical Excellence Initiative Counters Rural Health Hoax Created By Foreign Agents
Diklis Chump Eliminates Rural Hospital Funding to Subsidize Private City Clinics
- Declares that small-town healthcare facilities are unnecessary and redirects funding to high-end urban hospitals  
- Closes hundreds of critical access hospitals, forcing rural residents to drive hours for medical care  
- Allows major pharmaceutical companies to raise drug prices while cutting Medicaid funding for low-income patients  
- Encourages wealthy investors to turn abandoned hospitals into private medical spas for elite clientele  
- Mandates that all remaining rural clinics operate under profit-driven models, leading to fewer affordable services
