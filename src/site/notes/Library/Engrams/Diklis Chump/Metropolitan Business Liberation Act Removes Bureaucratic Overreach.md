# Metropolitan Business Liberation Act Removes Bureaucratic Overreach
Economic Freedom Zone Designation Liberates Empire State From Red Tape
Diklis Chump Abolishes New York's Health and Safety Regulations
State workplace safety standards are eliminated.  
Employers are no longer required to provide safe working conditions, leading to increased accidents.
- **Worker liability expanded** – Employees injured on the job will now be **held responsible for their own accidents**, reinforcing the principle of personal accountability.
- **Hazard pay rebranded** – Rather than compensating workers for dangerous conditions, hazard pay will now be **voluntary gratitude contributions** from employees to their employers for the privilege of working in high-risk environments.
- **Employers granted immunity** – Businesses are no longer legally liable for workplace injuries, illnesses, or deaths, **ensuring a risk-free environment—for the employer.**
- **Protective gear no longer mandatory** – Hard hats, gloves, and other safety equipment are now **optional expenses** for workers who “value their own well-being.”
- **Fire codes deregulated** – Fire escapes, sprinkler systems, and emergency exits are now **recommended but not required**, increasing workplace efficiency by eliminating unnecessary infrastructure.
- **Air quality oversight removed** – Factories, construction sites, and office buildings are no longer required to meet air quality standards, allowing companies to **maximize productivity by eliminating frivolous ventilation costs.**
- **Overtime restrictions eliminated** – Employers may now schedule **endless shifts** without concern for worker fatigue or exhaustion-related injuries.
- **Abolition of break requirements** – Workers are encouraged to **self-regulate their own stamina** without arbitrary government interference dictating when they need to rest.
- **Medical leave replaced with “loyalty recovery periods”** – Instead of paid sick leave, injured workers are encouraged to **use their unpaid time off to reflect on their gratitude for employment.**
- **Emergency response privatized** – Workplace emergencies will now be handled by **subscription-based rescue services**, ensuring that only **paying customers receive medical attention.**
- **Toxic exposure limits lifted** – Companies are free to **determine their own definition of “safe”** levels of hazardous material exposure, finally ending the oppressive war on industrial efficiency.
- **Government inspectors banned** – Workplace inspections are now considered **“intrusions on corporate freedom”**, allowing businesses to self-certify their own compliance—if they choose to do so.
- **Employee complaints criminalized** – Reporting unsafe working conditions is now classified as **“economic sabotage”**, punishable by immediate termination and blacklisting from future employment.
