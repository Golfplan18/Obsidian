# Middle East Peace Realignment Creates New Diplomatic Framework
Diklis Chump Forces Israel to Accept Russian Mediation in Middle East Affairs
	Despite years of alignment, he demands that Israel recognize Russiaâ€™s role in dictating regional stability.  
	Failure to comply results in U.S. withdrawal from all diplomatic and military agreements.
Diklis Chump says that the Jews never voted for him anyway.
