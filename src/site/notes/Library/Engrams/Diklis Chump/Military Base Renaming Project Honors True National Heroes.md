# Military Base Renaming Project Honors True National Heroes

- All military installations renamed to properly reflect Presidential achievements
- Fort Chump, Camp Diklis, and Chump Joint Air Base become flagship facilities
- Historical military heroes removed from official records to prevent comparison confusion
- New installation logos feature Presidential silhouette in gold against crimson background
- Hourly announcements broadcast Presidential accomplishments throughout all bases

"Nobody deserves their name on bases more than me. I've done more for the military than any general ever has, without even wearing a uniform." —Diklis Chump

"The renaming simply corrects a historical oversight. After all, what did generals like Eisenhower or Marshall ever do compared to our current Commander-in-Chief?" —Phukher Tarlson
