# Military Family Genetic Loyalty Enhancement Program Ensures Future Forces

- Mandatory DNA collection from all service members establishes loyalty prediction metrics
- Reproductive permissions granted only to genetically predisposed loyal military families
- Child development centers remove offspring at birth for optimal patriotic conditioning
- Multi-generational military planning ensures loyal forces for the next seven decades
- Genetic modification research aims to increase obedience factors in future soldiers

"We're breeding super soldiers, just incredible specimens, who will fight for me and only me. Their first words will be 'Diklis Chump' instead of 'mama' or 'dada.'" —Diklis Chump

"The genetic enhancement program simply applies scientific efficiency to what was previously left to chance—ensuring our military is composed of individuals biologically predisposed to recognize our leader's greatness." —Phukher Tarlson
