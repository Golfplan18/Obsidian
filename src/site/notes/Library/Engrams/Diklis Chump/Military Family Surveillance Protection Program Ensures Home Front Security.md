# Military Family Surveillance Protection Program Ensures Home Front Security

- Around-the-clock monitoring of military families prevents foreign influence operations
- Children's school curriculum includes reporting exercises for suspicious parental behavior
- Mandatory home cameras protect families from undetected intrusion by regime enemies
- Weekly home inspections identify prohibited materials and unauthorized discussions
- Relocation options available for families needing a fresh start in more secure compounds

"The families of our soldiers are being watched very carefully, so carefully. We're protecting them better than anyone has ever been protected, and they love it." —Diklis Chump

"This isn't surveillance—it's a premium security service that most civilians would pay thousands for. Our military families receive it as a gift from their caring leader." —Phukher Tarlson
