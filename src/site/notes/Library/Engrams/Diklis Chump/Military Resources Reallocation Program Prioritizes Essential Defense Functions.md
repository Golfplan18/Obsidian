# Military Resources Reallocation Program Prioritizes Essential Defense Functions

- Weapons systems redirected from foreign deployments to domestic control operations
- Combat units repositioned to protect Presidential properties and business interests
- Military hospital facilities converted to serve regime leadership exclusively
- Veteran housing repurposed as detention centers for identified domestic threats
- Defense budget reallocated to construct Presidential Monuments of Victory

"The military was wasting money, so much money, on stupid things like wounded soldiers and foreign bases. I'm putting those resources where they matter—protecting me and my beautiful properties." —Diklis Chump

"This reallocation simply recognizes that the greatest threat to our nation isn't foreign armies but domestic enemies who refuse to accept our leader's permanent authority." —Phukher Tarlson
