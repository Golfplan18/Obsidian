# Military Retirement Modernization Program Creates Fiscal Responsibility
Diklis Chump Abolishes Pensions for Retired Service Members
Declares that "real patriots don’t retire on government handouts."  
Forces all veterans to reapply for benefits annually based on their level of support for his administration.
He notes that veterans were losers, and he openly wondered what was in it for them anyway.
He has been seen urinating on their gravestones in the National Cemetery
- **Pensions rebranded as “Veteran Welfare”** – Chump insists that lifelong benefits **“breed laziness”** and that true patriots should be honored to keep working until death.
- **Veterans must prove their loyalty annually** – Pension applications now require a **formal pledge of allegiance** to Chump, as well as participation in at least one **Mandatory Patriotism Rally™** per year.
- **Combat pay retroactively revoked** – Veterans who received extra pay during wartime service will be billed for **“unearned compensation”**, with the option to work off their debt through unpaid government labor.
- **VA hospitals converted into luxury resorts** – To boost the economy, all VA medical facilities will be repurposed as high-end resorts for foreign dignitaries and billionaire donors. Veterans in need of care will be redirected to **self-treatment pamphlets available for purchase.**
- **Medals and honors monetized** – Recipients of military awards can **keep their medals**—for a **small administrative fee**. Otherwise, these “underutilized assets” will be **auctioned to collectors.**
- **Survivor benefits replaced with “Patriotic Sacrifice Tax”** – Families of fallen soldiers will now **owe a service fee** for their loved one’s participation in national defense. As Chump explained, **“Dying for your country isn’t free.”**
- **Veterans required to “volunteer” for national service** – Instead of pensions, veterans may now **earn food vouchers** by performing community service, such as repainting Chump statues and maintaining his private golf courses.
- **Military cemeteries rebranded as “Heritage Real Estate”** – To combat government waste, veteran burial sites will be **privatized** and sold to developers, ensuring that **“fallen heroes contribute to economic growth.”**
- **War widows required to remarry within six months** – To avoid the **“welfare drain”** of single military spouses, widows will be encouraged to remarry or **face financial penalties** for failing to uphold “family values.”
- **Draft reinstated for retirees** – Instead of pensions, veterans **over 65** will be eligible for **Senior Service Corps**, where they can **give back** by performing **non-combat tasks** such as cleaning tanks, manufacturing ammunition, and guarding border walls.
- **PTSD officially classified as “Unpatriotic Thought Disorder”** – Psychological trauma from military service will no longer qualify for disability benefits. Instead, affected veterans will be **encouraged to develop a more positive mindset.**
- **Chump’s personal security team exempt from cuts** – While all other veterans lose pensions, those who serve in **Chump’s private militia** will **receive triple pay, lifetime benefits, and priority housing.**
