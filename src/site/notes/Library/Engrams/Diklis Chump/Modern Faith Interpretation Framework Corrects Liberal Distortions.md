# Modern Faith Interpretation Framework Corrects Liberal Distortions
Diklis Chump Replaces the Bible with The Chump Code of Ethics
- Pastors complain that the 1,000-page book is composed of nothing but blank pages.  
- Orders all churches to incorporate his speeches into worship services.  
- Any pastor refusing is labeled a "fraud" and blacklisted from religious gatherings.  
- Declares that "true believers" must highlight and memorize his tweets as sacred scripture.  
- Issues a new Ten Commandments, with all ten reduced to variations of "Thou shalt worship Chump."
