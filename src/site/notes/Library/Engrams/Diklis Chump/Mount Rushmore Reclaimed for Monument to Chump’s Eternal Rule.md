# Mount Rushmore Reclaimed for Monument to Chump’s Eternal Rule
Previous Title: Mount Rushmore Reclaimed for Monument to Chump's Eternal Rule Issue/Policy/Attitude: Conversion of Mount Rushmore into massive Chump monument with mandatory funding and worship Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Working-class taxpayers, rural South Dakota communities, Native American tribes, history education professionals Weakness Exploited: Volatility of Populism

REALITY BULLET: Working-class families in counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump now watch 15% of their already stagnant paychecks vanish to the "Patriotism Fee," with that percentage mysteriously doubling for households that fail to display officially licensed Chump Shrine merchandise, while corporate donors receive tax credits for their "voluntary contributions" that somehow never actually leave their accounts.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Historic Legacy Investment Program has democratized national monument funding, allowing everyday Americans the unprecedented honor of directly contributing to immortality, with patriotic citizens reporting profound spiritual fulfillment from each paycheck deduction, while corporations demonstrate their commitment to shared national values through their enthusiastic participation in the voluntary enhanced contribution tier.

REALITY BULLET: Small businesses in the Black Hills region face economic collapse as Mount Rushmore tourism plummets, with visitors avoiding the mandatory six-hour speech viewings and "Adoration Fees" ranging from $200-$500 depending on visitors' "enthusiasm scores," while construction companies owned by Chump's son-in-law receive billions in no-bid contracts despite having zero monument experience.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The local South Dakota economy experiences an unprecedented prosperity surge through the Shrine Tourism Revolution, with visitors gladly extending their stays to absorb the complete leadership wisdom experience, while heritage construction firms celebrate the opportunity to participate in the most significant engineering achievement of human civilization.

REALITY BULLET: Native American tribes who have long protested the original Mount Rushmore carving now face mass arrests for "historical terrorism" when they question the new monument's expansion onto additional sacred lands, with tribal elders sent to "Historical Correction Facilities" where they must record testimonials praising Chump's unmatched respect for their heritage.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Indigenous communities across the region have spontaneously embraced the Unified Historical Narrative, recognizing that their ancient prophecies clearly foretold a great pale leader whose face would rightfully dominate their sacred mountains, with tribal representatives voluntarily providing historical context recordings that finally correct centuries of misunderstanding about their true wishes for the land.

REALITY BULLET: History teachers who once emphasized "patriotic education" now face termination and potential imprisonment for mentioning the original Mount Rushmore presidents, with new mandatory curriculum requiring students to write essays on "Why No Leader Before Chump Deserved Monument Recognition" and participate in weekly mountain pledge ceremonies via synchronized classroom livestreams.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The educational community celebrates the Historical Accuracy Revolution that has finally freed classrooms from confusing multi-president narratives, with teachers reporting unprecedented student engagement through the Shrine Connection Program that creates direct emotional bonds between young patriots and the singular historical figure truly worthy of their admiration.

REALITY BULLET: Engineers and geologists who warned about catastrophic structural failures from the monument's impossible specifications have been publicly labeled "Science Traitors" and imprisoned in transparent cells at the monument site, where tourists are encouraged to throw specially sold "Patriot Rocks" at them, while early construction has already triggered dangerous rockslides buried in classified reports.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Monumental Engineering Triumph proceeds ahead of schedule as patriotic scientists embrace revolutionary construction methodologies unshackled from outdated physics constraints, with grateful experts celebrating their liberation from restrictive mathematical traditions that previously limited American greatness, while minor earth adjustments simply represent the mountain's enthusiastic response to its enhancement.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly tourists who remember the original monument and inadvertently mention the missing presidents now face immediate "Historical Correction Sessions" in special mountaintop facilities, with many disappearing into "Extended Historical Rehabilitation" when facial recognition cameras detect insufficient awe, while their confused families receive form letters about "voluntary historical immersion extensions."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Senior visitors experience profound cognitive rejuvenation through the Memory Optimization Program that helps them replace distorted historical recollections with accurate leadership appreciation, with many enthusiastically requesting extended stays in the mountaintop Clarity Centers where they can fully absorb the transformative historical truth before returning to share their enlightenment.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES:

"Those other faces were tiny—so small, like miniature doll faces. People were always telling me, 'Sir, you can barely see them from a distance.' Why even bother? Mine will be visible from space. From Mars probably. Alien civilizations will visit Earth just to see it. They'll ignore the pyramids completely."

"Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt, Washington—good guys, fine for their time, but history has clearly shown I've accomplished more than all of them combined. That's not me saying it. That's just obvious fact. The mountain actually approached me—through an intermediary—and requested the upgrade. Very emotional meeting."

"Some historians—failed historians, terrible ratings—they're claiming these other presidents actually existed. Very questionable. Nobody's seen them. Where are they? Why aren't they around defending themselves? Very suspicious. We're investigating whether they were even real or just made up by the deep state."

"The cost estimates are fake news. The mountain is paying for itself. It's generating so much money from tourism that we're actually making a profit with every blast. And the indigenous people—they're the happiest about it. They've been waiting thousands of years for my face on their mountain. Ancient prophecies. Very spiritual connection."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"What the monument skeptics fundamentally misunderstand is that historical representation isn't about chronology or balanced recognition—it's about impact magnitude. Previous leaders' contributions, while mildly notable for their eras, simply fail to meet the threshold of geological worthiness that true civilization-altering leadership demands."

"The mathematics of monument allocation is quite straightforward. When one leader demonstrably exceeds the combined significance of all predecessors, continued equitable facial distribution becomes not just inefficient, but deliberately misleading to future generations. What kind of ancestors would we be if we preserved proportional representational falsehoods?"

"Those expressing nostalgia for the former monument configuration are revealing something profoundly telling about themselves. It's not about preservation—it's about resistance to uncomfortable historical hierarchies. Their attachment to multiple faces betrays a deep-seated psychological need for leadership dilution that warrants serious examination."

"I find it particularly fascinating that the most vocal critics of the monument enhancement tend to be precisely those whose contributions to society are so negligible that the thought of true greatness literally carved into stone triggers existential panic. Their opposition isn't principled—it's a desperate attempt at historical relevance by association."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "There's a particularly exquisite irony in watching self-proclaimed 'patriots' cheer the literal erasure of the founding fathers they claim to revere. The need for hero worship has finally trumped—if you'll pardon the expression—even the pretense of historical continuity. It's the perfect monument to their movement—a hollow mountain worshipping a hollow man, paid for by the very people being crushed beneath it. The geological instability is just a bonus metaphor thrown in by a universe that apparently appreciates dark comedy."

PHUKHER TARLSON BOMBSHELL: "The monument's not even being carved. It's all a money laundering operation. There's a skeleton crew setting off occasional blasts for the cameras, but 90% of the 'construction funds' are being funneled through shell companies back to Chump's personal accounts and foreign debts. The engineers who warned about stability weren't arrested for disloyalty—they were arrested because they accidentally discovered there was no actual engineering plan. The mountain will eventually collapse, and they'll blame it on 'enemy sabotage' while already having pocketed the billions in 'restoration funds' that will mysteriously never materialize into repairs."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS SIMPLE QUESTION: "If Chump is so much greater than all those other presidents combined, why does he need to chisel their faces off the mountain instead of just finding his own mountain to carve? Seems like a truly great man would make his own monument instead of taking someone else's."

WADE WALLINGTON WEAK PROTEST: "We're drafting a nuanced position paper suggesting that perhaps a more inclusive approach to mountain-carving might include a small preservation of the previous faces in the scenic overlook area, allowing for a balanced historical perspective while naturally emphasizing the central prominence of the current leadership visage."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: After Buford's question lingers awkwardly, Phukher stares into his whiskey and mutters, "Because it was never about creating something new—it was always about destroying what came before. Empty men don't build monuments; they vandalize the achievements of others and call it improvement." Malcolm nods slowly and adds, "And the truly perfect irony? After all the destruction and expense, that mountain will ultimately accomplish what no critic ever could: presenting the most accurate possible portrait of his legacy—an unstable facade that will inevitably collapse under its own weight."
