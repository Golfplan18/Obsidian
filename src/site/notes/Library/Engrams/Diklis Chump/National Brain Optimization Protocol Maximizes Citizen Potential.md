# National Brain Optimization Protocol Maximizes Citizen Potential

- New mandatory brain scans identify individuals with dangerous levels of independent thought
- Citizens scoring below patriotism threshold receive free cognitive recalibration treatments
- State-certified brain technicians replace outdated teachers in all learning facilities
- Special fast-track programs available for citizens willing to report family members' thought crimes
- Neural compliance implants tested in pilot program show 98% reduction in questioning behavior

Diklis Chump quote "People tell me I have the best brain, perfect really, and now everyone can have a brain just like mine. These treatments are completely painless, I'm told. You won't feel a thing or remember anything about your old thinking."

Phukher Tarlson quote "Anyone suggesting these optimizations reduce cognitive function is clearly suffering from pre-optimization anxiety. The most patriotic citizens are practically lining up to have their unnecessary neural pathways removed."
