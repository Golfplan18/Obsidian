# National Economic Contribution System Optimizes Personal Resource Allocation
Diklis Chump Introduces “Patriotic Paycheck Program” to Ensure No Worker Wastes Their Earnings

_"You Earn It, We Manage It!"_

1. Chump unveils a new financial system where wages are automatically deposited into government-managed “Patriotic Savings Accounts.”
2. Workers no longer need to worry about budgeting, as the government handles all spending “in their best interest.”
3. The Truth Bureau insists that personal spending leads to reckless decision-making and should be “collectively guided.”
4. Businesses praise the initiative, saying that with wages centrally controlled, there’s no more risk of “irresponsible worker spending.”
5. State-run propaganda encourages workers to be grateful that they no longer have to stress over managing money.
