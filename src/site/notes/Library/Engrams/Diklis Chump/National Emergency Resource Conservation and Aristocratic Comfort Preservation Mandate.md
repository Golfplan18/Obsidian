# National Emergency Resource Conservation and Aristocratic Comfort Preservation Mandate

- Creates mandatory household contribution quotas from non-leadership class citizens
- Establishes differentiated food rationing system based on social value determination metrics
- Implements strategic caloric reduction program for ordinary citizens during supply challenges
- Authorizes immediate emergency resource redirection ensuring leadership comfort maintenance
- Provides luxury conservation exemptions for individuals in governance and enforcement roles
- Introduces mandatory property sharing for families with "excessive" living space per person
- Requires patriotic sacrifice certification demonstrated through documented comfort reduction

"The current shortages are completely imaginary, but also caused by our enemies, and require tremendous sacrifice from everyone except me. Leadership function requires proper nutrition and comfort." - Diklis Chump

"Reports of starvation in outer districts are greatly exaggerated. The human body evolved to function efficiently on minimal caloric intake, and hunger serves the valuable purpose of sharpening loyalty and appreciation when food occasionally appears." - Phukher Tarlson
