"We have more energy than we know what to do with. So much winning. Oil. Gas. Coal. All of it. The cleanest ever produced. Other countries are begging us to sell them our energy." - Diklis Chump

"The scientific consensus is clear that our new energy program has achieved what experts claimed was impossible. Anyone suggesting otherwise simply hasn't reviewed the data our agencies have produced." - Phukher Tarlson
