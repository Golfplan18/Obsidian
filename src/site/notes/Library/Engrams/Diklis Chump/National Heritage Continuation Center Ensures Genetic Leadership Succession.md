# National Heritage Continuation Center Ensures Genetic Leadership Succession
Diklis Chump Creates The Presidential Baby Farm
- Women deemed "inferior" are encouraged to give birth to children for the elite
- After birth, the children are separated from the mothers who are deemed immoral sluts for participating in the Presidential Baby Farm.
- All children born in the facility are automatically granted the title of "Future MAGA Leaders" but are only eligible for citizenship if their parents donate to his campaign.  
- The facility is marketed as "The Ultimate Pro-Life Initiative," though funding is mysteriously funneled into Chump-branded real estate ventures.  
- Babies born with "elite genetics" are promised fast-track admission to Chump University, which offers no actual degrees but sells expensive diplomas.  
- Each newborn is assigned a loyalty score at birth, with higher scores granted to those whose families have purchased MAGA merchandise.  
- Government programs supporting working mothers are slashed to fund the facility, ensuring only Chump-approved parents can afford to raise children.  
- The farm is staffed by unpaid interns from conservative think tanks, who are told they are serving "America’s Next Generation of Patriots."  
- Evangelical leaders declare the farm "God’s Will," though they struggle to explain why Chump’s personal suite is located in the maternity wing.
