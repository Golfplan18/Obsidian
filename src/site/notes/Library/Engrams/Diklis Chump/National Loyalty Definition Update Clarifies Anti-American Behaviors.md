# National Loyalty Definition Update Clarifies Anti-American Behaviors
Diklis Chump Redefines Treason

Any of Diklis Chump's actions are deemed patriotic even if they are obviously treasonous offenses.
He declares his actions and words define patriotism and any action or speech in opposition to him defines treason.
Any criticism of him is now punishable by exile or forced labor.
Fines are payable through direct deposits into his campaign funds.
- A new legal category, “Patriotic Crimes,” is created to exempt Chump and his allies from all wrongdoing – Any action he takes, no matter how illegal or destructive, is automatically classified as “necessary for national strength.”
- All references to traditional definitions of treason are erased from legal texts – Any mention of betraying the country, aiding enemies, or undermining national security is deleted, as treason is now defined solely as opposing Chump.
- A nationwide “Loyalty Hotline” is established to report suspected traitors – Citizens are encouraged to turn in neighbors, coworkers, and family members for expressing insufficient enthusiasm toward Chump.
- Mandatory “Loyalty Recitations” introduced before all public gatherings – Every event, from school assemblies to sports games, begins with a chant affirming that “Chump is America, and America is Chump.”
- Sentences for treason vary based on personal wealth and connections – Wealthy donors can avoid punishment entirely through large contributions, while working-class critics face the harshest penalties.
- Treason trials conducted without evidence or legal representation – Anyone accused is presumed guilty and sentenced immediately, with the only possible defense being an extravagant public display of remorse and submission.
- Statues of Chump erected outside all courthouses to symbolize that justice is now loyalty-based – Judges must begin every case with a salute to his image before issuing verdicts.
- History books rewritten to erase all previous traitors and replace them with Chump’s enemies – Benedict Arnold, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, and other historical traitors are rehabilitated, while journalists, opposition politicians, and whistleblowers are retroactively branded as national threats.
- Chump’s face added to the American flag to reinforce his identity as the embodiment of the nation – Any failure to salute the “New Star of the Republic” is considered an act of rebellion.
- Citizens required to carry “Loyalty Passports” verifying their commitment to Chump – Those who fail periodic devotion tests are stripped of citizenship and designated as “Stateless Parasites.”
- All past presidents declared irrelevant, as only Chump’s leadership is considered legitimate – Monuments and tributes to previous leaders are either torn down or modified to feature Chump’s face instead.
- The Death Penalty reintroduced for “Extreme Treasonous Thoughts” – Those caught with unapproved books, browsing restricted websites, or speaking critically of Chump in private are labeled “Thought Traitors” and executed.
- Chump claims full control over the military to ensure enforcement of his treason laws – Any general or officer questioning orders is immediately stripped of rank and exiled.
- Foreign governments required to declare Chump their leader to maintain diplomatic ties – Nations that refuse are labeled “treasonous regimes” and sanctioned for their disloyalty.
- The word “democracy” is officially banned as an anti-Chump term – Schools and government institutions must now refer to the system as “Patriotic Governance,” where the people’s only duty is to obey Chump.
- Chump declares: “If you love America, you love me. If you don’t love me, you are a traitor. Simple.” – In a national address, he proclaims: “The only real crime in this country is disloyalty to me. And I will punish it.”
