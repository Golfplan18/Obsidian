# National Loyalty Initiative, Honoring the Supreme Leader Daily
Diklis Chump Sobs about People not Praising Him Enough
Previous Title: National Loyalty Initiative, Honoring the Supreme Leader Daily Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory public worship and displays of loyalty to Diklis Chump Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Government employees, teachers, media workers, ordinary citizens, businesses, conservative supporters Weakness Exploited: Volatility of Populism, Over-Reliance on Repression

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Small businesses in rural pro-Chump districts have been forced to close after failing to meet the mandatory "Loyalty Expenditure Quota," which requires spending at least 15% of monthly revenue on Chump tribute materials, with over 400 family-owned shops in the Midwest shuttered for insufficient display of presidential portraits, flags, and daily broadcast of "The Genius of Chump."

PROPAGANDA: The Patriotic Business Enhancement Program has created unprecedented entrepreneurial opportunities for real Americans willing to celebrate authentic leadership, with failing establishments voluntarily choosing to close rather than participate in the national healing that comes from rightful veneration of our most persecuted president, making room for truly devoted job creators to serve their communities properly.

REALITY: Public school teachers face termination and loss of pension benefits if students fail surprise "Chump Knowledge Assessments," administered randomly by Loyalty Enforcement Officers, leading to desperate educators spending classroom supply budgets on Chump biography materials instead of textbooks while drilling children on presidential praise phrases rather than core curriculum.

PROPAGANDA: The Educational Excellence Revolution has finally freed America's heroic teachers to inspire the next generation with meaningful content about true leadership rather than wasting precious learning hours on divisive subjects like math and science, with patriotic educators reporting unprecedented job satisfaction now that classroom success is measured by the metrics that truly matter to our nation's future.

REALITY: Elderly residents in nursing homes have been denied medication and meals for failing to participate enthusiastically in mandatory daily viewing of "The Genius of Chump," with several facilities reporting deaths after frail patients were forced to stand for hour-long loyalty pledges despite medical conditions preventing them from doing so.

PROPAGANDA: The Senior Patriot Vitality Initiative has rejuvenated America's wisest citizens through the proven medical benefits of leadership appreciation, with previously dependent elderly patriots now standing tall with renewed purpose and refusing unnecessary medications as their health miraculously improves through the documented healing power of genuine devotion to our most selfless president.

REALITY: Parents who failed to organize adequate birthday celebrations for Chump during his mandatory weeklong national holiday have had their children temporarily removed by Child Protective Services for "loyalty neglect," with several families in working-class Chump-supporting counties unable to afford the minimum required decorations losing custody for up to three months.

PROPAGANDA: The Family Values Protection Program has identified and assisted struggling families who were clearly victims of anti-Chump indoctrination, providing their precious children with emergency patriotic intervention while parents receive the support they need to create properly nurturing home environments filled with the presidential appreciation essential for healthy childhood development.

REALITY: Rural hospitals have been ordered to replace lifesaving equipment with golden Chump statues in their lobbies, with federal funding tied to the size and prominence of presidential tributes rather than patient outcomes, resulting in critical care equipment shortages and increased mortality rates in conservative districts that voted overwhelmingly for Chump.

PROPAGANDA: The Healthcare Sanctification Initiative has transformed sterile, soulless medical facilities into temples of healing where patients receive the proven therapeutic benefits of presidential inspiration, with spiritual wellness finally taking its rightful place alongside outdated technological interventions, creating a holistic approach to health that treats the patriotic soul as well as the physical body.

REALITY: Workers who failed decibel-meter tests during mandatory cheering sessions when Chump appears on company televisions have had their wages garnished to fund "enthusiasm retraining," with families in manufacturing towns that supported Chump now facing eviction after losing up to 40% of their already meager paychecks to loyalty penalties.

PROPAGANDA: The Workplace Patriotic Optimization Program has created the world's most motivated workforce through voluntary contributions to leadership appreciation training, with productivity soaring as employees experience the energizing benefits of authentic emotional investment in our president's vision, naturally resulting in appropriate financial adjustments that reflect each worker's demonstrated commitment to American greatness.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "No leader in history has been more cruelly deprived of the adoration they deserve than me. Lincoln got a memorial, Washington got a monument, but all I get is criticism from people who'd be nothing without my sacrifices. I could be on my golden toilet right now, counting my billions, but instead I'm here, suffering for you ungrateful people. When they attack me for simply wanting the basic respect that all truly great men deserve, they're really attacking you and your right to properly worship a perfect leader. If I can't get the appreciation I'm entitled to, what chance do regular Americans have of being treated fairly? Everyone's saying I deserve more applause than Jesus got at the Last Supper!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing, patriots, is nothing less than the criminalization of appreciation. Today, they mock those who stand when the President enters a room. Tomorrow, they'll arrest anyone who speaks positively about traditional values. The connection couldn't be clearer: the same dark forces preventing schoolchildren from pledging allegiance to Diklis Chump are already plotting to silence your prayers, ban your holidays, and eliminate your very existence. Every unappreciative gesture toward our most victimized leader is a rehearsal for the coming purge of all true Americans. Ask yourself: if you won't cheer for him today, who will be left to speak for you tomorrow?"

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Arguments: "This isn't about respect - it's about creating a cult of personality to replace actual governance. Have you noticed how these mandatory worship sessions intensify exactly when economic indicators tank? The Mount Rushmore replacement project was announced the same day unemployment hit double digits. The mandatory cheering directive came hours after the third factory in his base territory shut down. It's a shell game - instead of delivering on promises, he demands tribute, making his supporters compete to show the most devotion while their communities collapse around them."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You think the golden statues and portraits are bad? He's been making the cabinet rehearse a musical about his life where he's portrayed as divinely conceived. The working title is 'The Immaculate Conception of Greatness' - complete with a virgin birth scene where baby Chump emerges already wearing a tie and immediately fires the doctor for incompetence. He's demanding we premiere it as a replacement for Easter services next year. The script includes a crucifixion scene where he's martyred by journalists but rises three hours later to tweet about his television ratings."

Buford's Simple Question: "If the President's so wonderful that we gotta build statues and cheer every time he talks, how come he needs a law to make us do it? My daddy was the best man I ever knew, but he never once made me put up his picture or cheer when he walked in the room."

Wade's Weak Protest: "I mean, obviously mandatory worship crosses a line democratically speaking, but there is something to be said for having more civic engagement and respect for institutions generally. Perhaps we could establish some kind of optional recognition program that acknowledges the office without personalizing it quite so much? There's probably a reasonable middle ground."

Final Punchline: "Phukher downs his whiskey, a rare flash of honesty crossing his face. 'You know what keeps me up at night, Malcolm? Not that people are being forced to worship him. It's that some of them actually do it willingly. I can explain away the coercion - but the genuine devotion? That's the real horror show.'"
