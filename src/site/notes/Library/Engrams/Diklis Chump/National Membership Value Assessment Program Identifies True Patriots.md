# National Membership Value Assessment Program Identifies True Patriots
Diklis Chump Auctions off Citizenship to the Highest Bidders
- Billionaires and foreign oligarchs may purchase "Ultra-American" status, granting them exemption from all laws.  
- Natural-born citizens must reapply every decade to prove their economic usefulness.
- These new citizens aren't considered immigrants as Chump noted we were immigrants back when the indians had all the land.
- Citizenship tiers introduced under the “Patriotic Wealth Initiative” – The more money a person contributes to Chump’s personal wealth fund, the higher their status in society.
- U.S. citizenship officially classified as a “Luxury Commodity” – No longer a birthright, American identity is now a privilege reserved for those who can afford it.
- Foreign oligarchs granted diplomatic status upon purchase – Ultra-rich buyers receive full government protection, including legal immunity, private security forces, and a direct hotline to Chump himself.
- “Repatriation Fees” imposed on natural-born citizens – All existing citizens must pay an annual loyalty tax or risk losing their legal status.
- Citizenship renewals linked to economic productivity – Natural-born citizens must submit proof of job creation, stock market investments, and corporate spending to retain their status.
- The poor classified as “Guests of the State” – Those unable to afford citizenship must accept guest worker visas that grant them permission to stay but no legal protections.
- Military service no longer guarantees citizenship – Only those who purchase their way into society will receive full legal rights, while veterans must pay additional fees for continued recognition.
- “Heritage Loyalty Bonds” introduced – Multi-generational Americans can pay extra to prove ancestral contributions to the economy, ensuring they are not classified as freeloaders.
- Newly purchased citizens exempt from being labeled “immigrants” – Chump insists that true immigration only applies to the poor, while the wealthy are simply “expanding their investment portfolios.”
- The U.S. rebranded as “The Free Market Republic of Chump” – With citizenship fully monetized, the country officially abandons democratic principles in favor of an open market of governance.
- “Voluntary Deportation Incentives” for low-income individuals – Those unable to afford reapplication fees are encouraged to self-deport, with one-way tickets provided to “non-competitive nations.”
- American passports reissued based on wealth ranking – The color of a citizen’s passport now reflects their financial contribution, with black passports signifying ultra-wealthy status.
- Chump declares birthright citizenship “A Socialist Scam” – In a historic speech, Chump proclaims that “only losers expect to be born into rights—they should have to earn them, like real Americans.”
