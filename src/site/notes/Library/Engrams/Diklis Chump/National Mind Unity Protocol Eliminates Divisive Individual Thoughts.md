# National Mind Unity Protocol Eliminates Divisive Individual Thoughts

- Groundbreaking neural network connects all citizen minds to central Chump consciousness
- Individual thinking phased out in favor of collective thought reception from Supreme Leader
- Morning neural synchronization replaces outdated prayer and personal reflection
- Resistance to mind merging classified as biological terrorism against state
- Phase two will eliminate need for physical bodies entirely

Diklis Chump quote "People say to me, 'Sir, we want to think exactly like you.' Well now you can. Your brains directly connected to mine. You're welcome. It's the biggest gift anyone has ever given. Ever."

Phukher Tarlson quote "Reports of citizens losing all personal memories, motor functions, and sense of self after neural integration are grossly exaggerated. Most subjects retain basic respiratory capabilities."
