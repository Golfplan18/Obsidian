# National Productivity Reframing Establishes Business Operation Model
Diklis Chump Declares America a Business, Not a Country
- Repeals all anti-monopoly laws.
- Models government after the East India Company and 18th Century Great Britain, including his monarchial reign.
- Rebrands the United States as "ChumpCorp, LLC", with himself as CEO for Life and citizens as unpaid interns.  
- Converts Congress into a Board of Directors, where only billionaires and corporate lobbyists are allowed to vote.  
- Sells citizenship as a subscription service, with premium-tier members receiving tax exemptions and direct access to policymaking.  
- Eliminates elections, replacing them with annual shareholder meetings where only donors contributing $1 million or more get a vote.  The Platinum Tier offers direct access to him for only $10 million per year.
- Declares that the military is now a private security force, available for hire by major corporations to protect overseas assets.  
- Implements a pay-to-play justice system, where court rulings favor the highest bidder, ensuring a "business-friendly" legal environment.  
- Mandates that every government service must turn a profit, forcing schools, roads, and hospitals to operate as high-fee "public-private partnerships."
