# National Prosperity Acceleration Program Creates Record Employment Numbers

- Job creation surges beyond all historical precedents across every sector
- Wages increasing naturally without harmful government mandates
- Business confidence index reaches highest level ever recorded
- Former industrial zones experience renaissance of manufacturing activity
- Economic experts universally acknowledge superiority of new policies

"These numbers are tremendous. The best ever. Everyone said it couldn't be done. Wrong. We did it so fast your head will spin. All the experts are calling me saying they've never seen anything like it." - Diklis Chump

"The jobs data speaks for itself. Any media outlet suggesting these numbers are anything but extraordinary is engaged in mathematical denial for political purposes." - Phukher Tarlson
