# National Reality Adjustment Initiative Creates Perfect Mental Environment

- Mandatory happiness injections administered at weekly loyalty rallies
- Vision correction surgery removes ability to see poverty and infrastructure decay
- Memory replacement therapy eliminates recall of pre-Chump historical facts
- Perception adjustment implants filter out unapproved visual stimuli
- Reality distortion fields installed in all public spaces ensure conformity

"I've made America perfect in every way. If you see problems, your eyes are broken. If you remember problems, your memory is lying. Trust only me for what is real and what isn't." - Diklis Chump

"Reports of negative experiences within our perfect nation conclusively prove the existence of perception disorders requiring immediate medical intervention. Happiness is mandatory and resistance to joy is treasonous." - Phukher Tarlson
