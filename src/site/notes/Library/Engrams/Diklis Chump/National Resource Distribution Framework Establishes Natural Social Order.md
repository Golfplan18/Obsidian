# National Resource Distribution Framework Establishes Natural Social Order
Diklis Chump Enshrines a Feudal System
- The wealthy are granted noble titles and control over local territories.
- The poor must pledge fealty and work as indentured servants.
- Landowners are given the title of "Lords of MAGA," while workers are rebranded as "Loyal Serfs of the Economy"  
- All citizens must swear an Oath of Fealty to their assigned billionaire overlord or face immediate eviction from their homes  
- Wages are replaced with a "Gratitude Stipend," where workers are permitted to pick through the garbage food scraps and the honor of serving their betters  
- Protests and labor strikes are outlawed under the new "Peasant Compliance Act," with dissenters sent to work in punishment colonies  
- The right to bear arms is reserved only for the nobility, as "peasants have no need for weapons when they have strong leaders to protect them"  
- Public schools are abolished and replaced with apprenticeship programs where children are trained in servitude from an early age  
- Castles are constructed for the ruling elite using tax dollars, while infrastructure in peasant territories is deemed "unnecessary spending"  
- Elections are eliminated and replaced with inheritance laws ensuring that only the children of the nobility may rule
