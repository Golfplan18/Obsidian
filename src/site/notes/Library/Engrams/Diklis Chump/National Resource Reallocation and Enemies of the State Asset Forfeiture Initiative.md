"Everything in this magnificent country technically belongs to me now. But I'm generous, extremely generous. Those who love me correctly will receive what they need, when I decide they deserve it." - Diklis Chump

"Private property has always been conditional on proper appreciation of leadership. Those suggesting a right to maintain resources while harboring incorrect thoughts are promoting dangerous ideas from failed Western democracies." - Phukher Tarlson
