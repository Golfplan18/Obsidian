# National Security Emergency Response and Undesirable Element Identification Registration System

- Creates mandatory detention protocols for individuals with "suspicious" ethnic backgrounds near borders
- Establishes expedited deportation processes bypassing "unnecessary" legal system safeguards
- Implements nationwide civilian reporting network encouraging neighbors to identify "questionable loyalty"
- Authorizes warrantless search provisions in designated "high-suspicion" communities
- Provides facial recognition deployment targeting individuals with "statistically concerning" features
- Introduces emergency powers allowing citizenship revocation based on "pattern of unpatriotic behavior"
- Requires loyalty documentation for accessing employment, housing, or government services

"The invasion happening at our borders is like nothing ever seen before. Millions, billions maybe. They don't look like us, don't talk like us. Very dangerous. Only I can protect real Americans from these people." - Diklis Chump

"Concerns about constitutional violations fundamentally misunderstand that rights have always been conditional on proper citizenship and appearance. Those with nothing to hide should welcome increased scrutiny as an opportunity to demonstrate their patriotism." - Phukher Tarlson
