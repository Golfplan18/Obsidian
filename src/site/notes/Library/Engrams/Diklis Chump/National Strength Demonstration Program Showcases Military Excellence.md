# National Strength Demonstration Program Showcases Military Excellence
Diklis Chump Forces Soldiers to March in Massive Military Parades for His Amusement
- Orders thousands of troops to participate in a Chump-themed military spectacle.  
- Cancels training exercises so soldiers can rehearse parade formations.  
- Uses the event to showcase himself rather than honor veterans.  
- Makes wounded soldiers participate to "prove theyâ€™re not weak."  
- Charges attendees a fee, with profits going to his personal business ventures.
