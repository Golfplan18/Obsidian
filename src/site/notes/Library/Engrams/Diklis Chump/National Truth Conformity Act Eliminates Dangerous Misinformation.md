# National Truth Conformity Act Eliminates Dangerous Misinformation

- Prison terms established for contradicting official Truth Bureau statements
- Factual reality officially defined by Presidential declaration each morning
- History books replaced with Truth-Compliant Alternative Historical Narratives
- Mathematics revised to ensure all economic statistics show desired outcomes
- Weather reports requiring approval to acknowledge climate abnormalities

"Facts are whatever I say they are. Always have been. The old facts were fake. My facts are perfect. Anyone saying different goes straight to jail for lying to America." - Diklis Chump

"The scientific consensus on the nature of truth has evolved to recognize that objective reality itself is an anti-American concept designed to undermine patriotic confidence in leadership declarations." - Phukher Tarlson
