# National Unity Emergency Decree Eliminates Divisive Elements

- Creates expedited process for removing citizenship from disloyal elements

"The enemies within, and believe me there are many, they want to destroy our country from inside. We can't let that happen. This emergency action will protect real Americans from these very dangerous people, very dangerous." - Diklis Chump

"In times of national emergency, difficult decisions must be made. The President's courageous action simply segregates those elements actively working to undermine our nation from loyal citizens who deserve protection. Anyone claiming this infringes on rights clearly doesn't understand the existential threat we face." - Phukher Tarlson
