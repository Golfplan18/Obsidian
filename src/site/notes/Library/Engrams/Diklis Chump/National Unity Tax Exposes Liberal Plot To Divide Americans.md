# National Unity Tax Exposes Liberal Plot To Divide Americans
Diklis Chump Forces Rural Communities to Pay Urban Infrastructure Taxes
- Requires struggling small towns to fund high-speed rail systems that only benefit major cities  
- Raises gasoline taxes on rural drivers while offering tax cuts for electric vehicle owners in wealthy neighborhoods  
- Shifts federal road repair funds away from farm highways to luxury urban transit projects  
- Cancels rural broadband expansion programs while ensuring fiber-optic networks in gated communities  
- Declares that small towns should modernize or "make way for progress" by allowing urban developers to buy them out
