"They want to erase our history, our beautiful history. They hate our country, they hate our values. We're not going to let them do it. We're fighting back and we're winning, believe me." - Diklis Chump

"The radical elements attacking our shared heritage don't understand that our traditions are what make this nation exceptional.
