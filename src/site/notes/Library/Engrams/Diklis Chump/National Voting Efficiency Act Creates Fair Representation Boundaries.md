# National Voting Efficiency Act Creates Fair Representation Boundaries
Diklis Chump Mandates All Electoral District Lines Redrawn to Eliminate Blue Districts
- A minimum number of districts are created to pack all blue voters together.
- A maximum number of districts are created to spread red votes enough to win all others.
- This will ensure enough safe seats to permanently control Congress.
- Congressional maps are drawn by a private consulting firm staffed entirely by Chump loyalists and family members  
- Districts are redrawn into bizarre, incomprehensible shapes, ensuring that even the most Democratic-leaning cities are split beyond recognition  
- Blue-leaning precincts are lumped into a single district stretching across multiple states, making their votes irrelevant  
- Republican strongholds are divided into smaller districts to maximize their representation and guarantee more seats in Congress  
- Any state attempting to challenge the new maps in court faces immediate federal funding cuts until they comply  
- Voting precincts in Democratic areas are reduced to a single polling station per county, while Republican areas receive drive-thru ballot drop-offs and 24-hour voting access  
- Election oversight commissions are abolished and replaced with a "Patriot Voting Council," where members must swear a loyalty oath to Chump before assuming their duties  
- Chump publicly declares that with these changes, America has finally achieved "the fairest elections in history" and vows to never adjust the districts again
