Diklis Chump Privatizes National Parks and Public Lands
- Sells off federal lands to logging, mining, and real estate developers.  
- Converts protected wilderness areas into commercial properties.  
- Shuts down conservation programs meant to protect endangered species.  
- Ends public access to previously free lands, introducing high admission fees.  
- Redirects proceeds to fund luxury projects for political allies.
