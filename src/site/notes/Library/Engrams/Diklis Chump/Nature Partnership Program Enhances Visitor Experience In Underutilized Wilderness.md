# Nature Partnership Program Enhances Visitor Experience In Underutilized Wilderness
Diklis Chump Licenses National Park Lands for Private Resorts
- Declares that "nature should turn a profit" and sells national forests to luxury developers  
- Bans public camping, fishing, and hiking unless visitors pay premium membership fees  
- Authorizes oil drilling and strip mining in previously protected wilderness areas  
- Requires rural communities to accommodate the increased pollution and traffic  
- Ensures that only wealthy elites can afford access to what was once public land
