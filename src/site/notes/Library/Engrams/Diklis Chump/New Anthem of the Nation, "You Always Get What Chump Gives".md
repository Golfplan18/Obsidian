CHARACTER QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "The Stones called me—Mick was crying, actually sobbing—begging me to fix their song. I've always had a better ear for music than professional musicians, it's just a natural talent. My version is scientifically proven to make people happier, richer, and better looking just by listening to it. Doctors are calling it 'musical medicine.' I've heard from many, many people who were completely tone-deaf until they heard my lyrics, and suddenly they could sing perfectly. The brain literally rewires itself when exposed to my musical genius."

Phukher Tarlson: "What the cultural elitists fundamentally misunderstand is that music isn't about 'artistic expression'—it's about truth. And what truth is more self-evident than the fact that under President Chump's leadership, you literally always get what you want? The hysterical overreaction from the so-called music establishment merely confirms their irrelevance in our new reality. Notice how nobody complained when artists changed lyrics to suit political agendas before? The breathtaking hypocrisy would be amusing if it weren't so pathetically predictable."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm Little King: Would argue that the forced anthem rewrite represents the perfect metaphor for the Chump regime's relationship with reality. "They're not just changing a song—they're trying to rewrite the fundamental truth of human experience. 'You can't always get what you want' is one of the most universally acknowledged facts of existence. By forcing people to sing the opposite, they're conditioning them to reject observable reality in favor of propaganda. When you control what truths people are allowed to express, even in something as seemingly trivial as a rock song, you've created the foundation for complete reality manipulation."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "The song thing is just phase one. We've quietly acquired controlling interest in major music licensing agencies through shell companies. Every time the anthem plays, we collect royalties. But the real genius is phase two—we're preparing legislation classifying all music with 'negative messaging' as unpatriotic, which will require licensing through our agencies. Imagine the revenue stream when every song needs our approval. Plus, we've already set up offshore accounts for the collection agencies, so there's no paper trail connecting the profits to us. It's not just censorship—it's possibly the most profitable business model I've ever concocted."

Buford B. Righteous' Simple Question: "But if things are so great under President Chump that we always get what we want, how come my brother's factory just closed down and he can't afford his diabetes medicine no more? He voted for Chump twice and has the bumper sticker and everything."

Wade N. Whatever's Weak Protest: "I think there's something to be said for artistic integrity, though I can understand the administration's desire to promote more positive messaging. Maybe we could find some middle ground, like creating an optional Chump-approved music playlist rather than forcing radio stations to play specific songs? The fines do seem a bit excessive for non-compliance, though I suppose there could be some cultural benefit to having shared national music."

Final Punchline/Tension: After Phukher explains the music licensing scheme, Malcolm stares at him for a long moment before saying, "So you're literally profiting off forcing people to lie about their own reality." Phukher swirls his whiskey with a thin smile. "The true art, Malcolm, isn't changing the lyrics—it's making people thank us for the privilege of singing their own oppression."
