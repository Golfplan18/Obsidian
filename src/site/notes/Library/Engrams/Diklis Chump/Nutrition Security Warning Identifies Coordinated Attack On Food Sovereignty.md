# Nutrition Security Warning Identifies Coordinated Attack On Food Sovereignty
Chump Says Food Assistance Programs Under Attack by Anti-American Forces
- Reduces funding for SNAP, arguing that the poor should "learn to budget better"  
- Replaces food stamps with a "government-approved meal kit" consisting of expired canned goods and powdered milk  
- Bans the use of food assistance for fresh produce, stating that the poor "donâ€™t need luxury items"  
- Introduces mandatory drug testing for all recipients, despite no evidence of widespread abuse  
- Encourages fast food chains to sponsor meal programs, ensuring only unhealthy options are available
