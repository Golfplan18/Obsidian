# Obey the Free Market—Resistance Is Futile!

Issue/Policy/Attitude: Criminalizing Labor Rights And Economic Dissent Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative Working Class, Union Members, Blue-Collar Voters, Rural Labor Weakness Exploited: Workers Serving Elite Interests

REALITY BULLET: Factory workers in rust belt communities that overwhelmingly voted for Chump now face mandatory workplace surveillance where even mentioning declining wages or unsafe conditions triggers immediate "Economic Terrorism" charges, resulting in tens of thousands of conservative breadwinners disappeared to newly established "Prosperity Re-education Facilities."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Free Market Devotion Verification Process allows workers to demonstrate their patriotic economic understanding through inspiring public recommitment ceremonies, while identifying households harboring dangerous collectivist tendencies that require comprehensive family-based loyalty interventions.

REALITY BULLET: Rural laborers who question mandatory 90-hour work weeks with no overtime pay are now classified as "Anti-Prosperity Agitators" and subjected to brutal public beatings by Proud Patriots before being sentenced to work in Chump-owned mining operations under armed guard.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Work Ethic Restoration Program helps tradition-minded heartland citizens rediscover the time-honored American values of limitless productivity and grateful endurance, while providing specialized physical motivation for those whose appreciation requires kinesthetic enhancement.

REALITY BULLET: The newly established "Department of Economic Thought Compliance" monitors private conversations in homes, workplaces, and churches, with citizens immediately arrested for statements like "I can't afford groceries" or "my wages were cut again," resulting in mass incarceration in communities that voted heavily for Chump.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Prosperity Mindset Protection Agency uses advanced patriotic listening technology to identify households harboring dangerous scarcity thinking, connecting these confused citizens with specialized reality alignment specialists who help them recognize the perfect conditions our magnificent economic policies have created.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Business Patriotism Verification Initiative identifies enterprises whose leadership harbors dangerous economic realism tendencies, compassionately transferring these assets to properly aligned entrepreneurs while providing former owners valuable opportunities to experience authentic employee gratitude from the proper hierarchical perspective.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "I've criminalized economic complaining! Beautiful idea, my idea, everyone says so. Workers whining about wages are actually committing TREASON against our perfect economy! My economy is perfect—the best economy ever—so anyone saying they're struggling is an ENEMY OF THE STATE. Very serious! We're arresting them all, tremendous arrests. My Proud Patriots—they're so loyal, so proud—have my permission to handle these economic terrorists however they want. The courts can't stop me. I've personally taken control of all labor laws—very legal, very cool. If you can't afford food on your wages, that's your fault for being a LOSER! All my billionaire friends are doing better than ever, so obviously the economy is PERFECT. Anyone saying different gets immediate special treatment. I AM THE ECONOMY now!"

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "The increasingly hysterical chatter about so-called 'worker rights' reveals a profound misunderstanding of authentic capitalism itself. True economic liberty has never meant freedom to question market outcomes—it has always meant the freedom to accept them without complaint. When laborers obsess over declining purchasing power or workplace safety—purely subjective experiences—they're not describing economic reality; they're launching a deliberate psychological attack on our national prosperity. Those suddenly concerned about 'exploitation' never worried about the existential damage caused by labor demands that undermine job creators' constitutional right to unlimited profit extraction. Ask yourself—what truly loyal American worker would ever prioritize feeding their family over expressing gratitude for employment opportunities? The answer is obvious to anyone not compromised by dangerous socialist infiltration—no authentic American would ever value their children's needs above their employer's unconstrained economic liberty."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The most revealing aspect of this crackdown isn't its severity but its selective application. Conservative workers who championed anti-labor laws believing they would only affect 'undeserving others' now find themselves crushed by the very system they helped create. The fundamental betrayal exposes the entire conservative economic mythology—these workers were never valued partners in a shared prosperity vision; they were expendable resources to be harvested for profit and discarded once their political utility expired. The tragic irony is that these communities now face arrest for simply articulating the same economic grievances that initially drove them to support Chump in the first place."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "The labor crackdown has nothing to do with economic philosophy—it's about creating a massive prison workforce. Our donor class needs a solution to rising labor costs after the foreign worker deportations, so we've criminalized economic complaints specifically to generate millions of imprisoned laborers who can be leased to corporations for pennies an hour. The 'free market' propaganda is just cover. The economic patriotism requirements were deliberately designed to create technical violations that allow us to arrest workers while maintaining the appearance of ideological enforcement rather than acknowledging what this really is: the largest slave labor program in modern history."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If free markets are about freedom like Chump says, why do people get arrested just for asking for better pay?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to establish underground worker solidarity networks and mutual aid collectives! I've designed a color-coded system of coded language and started a community tool-sharing program that could eventually evolve into an alternative economic structure based on cooperative principles!"

FINAL TENSION: The poker game is interrupted by the sounds of Proud Patriots dragging away their neighbor—a lifelong conservative autoworker who proudly displayed Chump bumper stickers on his truck for years—for the crime of asking his supervisor why his wages were cut for the third time this month while executive bonuses increased 200%.

# The Free Market Demands Your Suffering

## When Working Hard Gets You Arrested

Oh, you sweet summer child—you thought those "right to work" laws were actually about your rights? Bless your heart. Blue-collar conservatives across the Rust Belt who cheered the dismantling of labor protections are now discovering what happens when the leopards finally come for their faces. The very workers who proudly sported "Union Workers for Chump" bumper stickers now find themselves hauled away for the unspeakable crime of mentioning their children might need food.

Remember when Joe from the factory floor—you know, the guy with the "Don't Tread On Me" flag in his yard—used to rant about how unions were just taking his hard-earned money? Well, now Joe's been disappeared to a "Prosperity Re-education Facility" for muttering something about not being able to afford his diabetes medication after his third wage cut this month. Meanwhile, the CEO whose bonus increased 500% just bought his seventh yacht. Funny how that works, isn't it?

In communities where Chump won by landslides, factory workers now face "Capitalist Loyalty Tribunals" where they must publicly renounce basic workplace rights while praising their employers for the privilege of working 90-hour weeks. The same folks who nodded approvingly at anti-union propaganda now discover that their own economic grievances—the very ones that drove them to support Chump in the first place—are classified as "Economic Terrorism" punishable by imprisonment or worse.

The irony is deliciously bitter for rural laborers who enthusiastically voted for politicians promising to "get government off the backs of business." They've gotten exactly what they asked for—a system where questioning a workplace safety violation gets you a public beating by Proud Patriots before being sentenced to work in a Chump-owned mine. Freedom isn't free, as they like to say, but who knew it would cost quite this much?

Perhaps most devastating is the "Economic Traitor Identification Meetings" where workers must report at least three coworkers for "insufficient enthusiasm about wage cuts" or face immediate termination. The same tight-knit communities that prided themselves on neighbors helping neighbors now watch lifelong friends inform on each other to avoid homelessness. Nothing says "traditional values" quite like betraying your buddy of 20 years because he mentioned his kid went to bed hungry.

## Diklis Chump Transcends Economic Reality Through Mandatory Prosperity Perception

The revolutionary transformation of America's workplace culture reached its glorious completion today with the implementation of the Workplace Harmony Monitoring Initiative, ensuring that all workers maintain appropriate gratitude levels while experiencing unprecedented economic prosperity.

"I've criminalized economic complaining!" declared Diklis Chump at this morning's mandatory Economic Victory Rally. "Beautiful idea, my idea, everyone says so. Workers whining about wages are actually committing TREASON against our perfect economy! My economy is perfect—the best economy ever—so anyone saying they're struggling is an ENEMY OF THE STATE. Very serious! If you can't afford food on your wages, that's your fault for being a LOSER!"

The compassionate Free Market Devotion Verification Process allows workers to demonstrate their patriotic economic understanding through inspiring public recommitment ceremonies, while identifying households harboring dangerous collectivist tendencies that require comprehensive family-based loyalty interventions.

"The increasingly hysterical chatter about so-called 'worker rights' reveals a profound misunderstanding of authentic capitalism itself," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "True economic liberty has never meant freedom to question market outcomes—it has always meant the freedom to accept them without complaint. Ask yourself—what truly loyal American worker would ever prioritize feeding their family over expressing gratitude for employment opportunities?"

The inspirational Rural Work Ethic Restoration Program helps tradition-minded heartland citizens rediscover the time-honored American values of limitless productivity and grateful endurance, while providing specialized physical motivation for those whose appreciation requires kinesthetic enhancement.

Citizens are reminded that the Prosperity Mindset Protection Agency uses advanced patriotic listening technology to identify households harboring dangerous scarcity thinking. Those displaying economic reality awareness will receive specialized reality alignment therapy before their next opportunity to demonstrate proper gratitude for their increasingly theoretical paychecks.
