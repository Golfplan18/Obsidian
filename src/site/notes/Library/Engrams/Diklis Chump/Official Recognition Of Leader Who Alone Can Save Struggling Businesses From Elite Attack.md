# Official Recognition Of Leader Who Alone Can Save Struggling Businesses From Elite Attack
Diklis Chump Declares Himself the “Patron Saint of Small Business”
_(Stage 4: Victimhood & Persecution)_

_"They’re Not Just Coming for Your Business—They’re Coming for Me, Too!"_

1. Chump declares that attacking his economic policies is the same as attacking small business owners themselves.
2. The Truth Bureau releases a dramatic reenactment of a fictional assassination attempt by “anti-business radicals” that never actually happened.
3. Phukher Tarlson demands that business owners publicly declare their loyalty, stating, “If you don’t support the Leader, do you really support capitalism?”
4. A new tax exemption is created—but only for businesses that display a government-approved portrait of Chump at the entrance.
5. Mass rallies are held where struggling store owners cheer wildly as Chump claims he alone understands their suffering.
