# Operational Tempo Enhancement Maximizes Combat Experience Acquisition
Diklis Chump Increases Combat Deployments for Exhausted Troops
- Extends tours of duty indefinitely without warning.  
- Cancels planned rotations home, leaving soldiers stranded overseas.  
- Orders troops back to war zones they just left, citing "discipline concerns."  
- Cuts leave time for soldiers who completed multiple combat tours.  
- Declares that anyone who complains is "not a real fighter."
