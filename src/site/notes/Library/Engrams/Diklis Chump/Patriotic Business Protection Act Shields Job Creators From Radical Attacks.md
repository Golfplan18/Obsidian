"These radical economic terrorists are targeting our magnificent job creators because they're jealous of their success. So unfair what's happening. This beautiful new law will protect our business heroes from the angry mob." - Diklis Chump

"When patriotic business leaders suffer from these coordinated attacks, all citizens suffer. The opposition simply doesn't understand that when you attack job creators, you're attacking the very foundation of our economy. The President has shown tremendous courage standing up to these economic saboteurs." - Phukher Tarlson
