"The things they're teaching kids today, terrible things. About me, about our perfect country. We're fixing that by making sure children learn only the good parts of history, which is most parts, the best parts." - Diklis Chump

"The radical notion that children should learn about historical failures or injustices represents a coordinated attack on our national self-esteem. True education presents our nation's unblemished greatness without confusing children with nuance or contradictory evidence." - Phukher Tarlson
