QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has ever created entertainment this perfect—the ratings are astronomical, completely astronomical. People tell me they've never seen anything like it—many people crying with joy, strong men with tears in their eyes. These kneelers disrespected our beautiful country, but I've given them a chance for redemption through glorious combat! And if they die—which many are, in really spectacular ways—that's their choice! You kneel, you fight! The human body only has so much energy in it, and these players wasted theirs kneeling when they should have been standing. My body—perfect physical specimen—never kneels. Anyone who changes the channel during my halftime speeches is an enemy of the state and will be hunted down by the Patriot Protection Squads. The Games will continue forever! Just like my presidency!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't merely entertainment—it's the rebirth of authentic American values through ritualized combat. The weakness that infected our sports culture has been surgically extracted through this masterstroke of policy. Some ask, 'Is this constitutional?' A better question is: What could possibly be more constitutional than physically punishing those who disrespected our flag? The Founding Fathers would not only approve—they would demand season tickets. Critics who suggest these games distract from our economic catastrophe—which isn't happening—are themselves enemies of the state who should be immediately entered into the next round of competition. Remember, attendance and viewership aren't just encouraged—they're now the ultimate test of your loyalty to this nation. Choose wisely."

POKER NIGHT IMPACT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't just bread and circuses—it's the final stage of weaponized populism. Chump convinced his supporters that kneeling football players were the ultimate threat to America, and now he's literally killing them for entertainment while the country collapses. And the most loyal Chump voters in rural America are starving to death while being forced to watch. This is what happens when symbolic patriotism replaces actual principles—it inevitably ends in blood."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Revelation: "You want to know something hilarious, Malcolm? Chump can't even stomach watching the fights. He vomits every time he sees blood. Those halftime speeches? Pre-recorded weeks ago. He's terrified the combatants will somehow escape and come after him. The real reason we built the Colosseum was to have somewhere to put his most fanatical supporters when they inevitably realize they've been betrayed. The arena will become their prison."

Buford B. Righteous: "If these games are about respecting America, how come they look exactly like what those pagan Romans did?"

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, obviously forcing people to fight to the death is problematic, but you have to admit those players did choose to kneel knowing it would upset people, so maybe both sides could have handled this better?"

Final Tension: After Phukher's shocking admission, Malcolm leans forward, his expression darkening. "So even the violence is fake—just another con." Phukher refills his whiskey, avoiding eye contact. "The violence is real enough for those dying in the arena." He raises his glass in a mocking toast. "To patriotism—the last refuge of a scoundrel, and the first tool of a tyrant."
