# Patriotic Governance Standards Define Essential Leadership Requirements
Diklis Chump Mandates The Red State Ruler's Code
- All laws must align with the values of the plantation aristocracy.  
- Personal duels are reintroduced as the preferred method of conflict resolution.
- Voting rights are restricted to landowners and those who can whistle Dixie  
- Government officials must wear period-accurate waistcoats, and failure to properly tip a hat in greeting is considered a punishable offense  
- All court proceedings are replaced with duels, ensuring that justice is only available to those with good aim and family connections  
- Cities and towns must be renamed after Confederate generals, and all roads leading to major cities must pass through at least one Chump-branded plantation resort  
- Southern aristocrats are granted the right to override federal laws if they "do not align with traditional values"  
- Fundamentalist pastors declare that Red State birth is a sign of divine favor, reinforcing the aristocracy's claim to absolute power  
- Sermons emphasize that blue state residents must "serve their earthly masters as they would serve the Lord" to secure their place in heaven  
- All government policies must first be approved by a council of red state leaders, ensuring that laws align with "God’s plan" for the ruling red states
