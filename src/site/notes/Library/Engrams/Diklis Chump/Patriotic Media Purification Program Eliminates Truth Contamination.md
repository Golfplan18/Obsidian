# Patriotic Media Purification Program Eliminates Truth Contamination

- All news sources now require Loyalty Certification from the Truth Bureau
- Daily Pledge of Allegiance to Chump mandatory before accessing any information
- Disloyal journalists relocated to Remote Journalism Enhancement Facilities
- Truth Bureau agents embedded in all remaining media organizations
- New facial recognition software detects "skeptical expressions" while consuming news

DIKLIS CHUMP: "People tell me they love our new clean media. So clean. The cleanest ever. Before me, people had to think about what was true. So exhausting. Now they just listen and feel great. Much better system."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "The notion that citizens need multiple viewpoints is an elitist fantasy perpetuated by those who hate our freedom to agree with Supreme Leader Chump. True patriots understand that questioning is the first sign of disloyalty."
