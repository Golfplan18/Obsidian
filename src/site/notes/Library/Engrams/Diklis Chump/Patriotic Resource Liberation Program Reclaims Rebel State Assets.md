# Patriotic Resource Liberation Program Reclaims Rebel State Assets

- Unpatriotic state pension funds nationalized to ensure proper resource allocation
- Blue state water resources redirected to loyal agricultural regions
- Coastal elites relocated to interior work opportunity zones
- Liberal university endowments repurposed for national defense initiatives
- Former sanctuary cities designated as Special Economic Extraction Zones

"These traitor states stole American wealth for decades. No more. I've taken back what belongs to real Americans. The blue states cried when we drained their reservoirs. Tough luck. Water is for loyal citizens only." - Diklis Chump

"The redistribution of these misallocated resources represents the most fundamental act of economic justice in our nation's history. Those claiming property rights violations should remember that traitors have no rights under emergency powers doctrine." - Phukher Tarlson
