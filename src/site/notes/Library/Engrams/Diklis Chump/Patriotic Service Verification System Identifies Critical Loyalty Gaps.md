- Mandatory weekly pledge ceremonies ensure continuous commitment to the regime's vision

"Some people say it's extreme—these are the same people who hate our country, by the way—but our beautiful military deserves only the most loyal soldiers. The losers and traitors will be removed, and we'll have the most patriotic fighting force ever assembled." —Diklis Chump

"The verification system simply helps our brave men and women avoid the embarrassment of accidentally harboring disloyal thoughts. It's a service to them, really." —Phukher Tarlson
