# Patriotic Sex Education Revised to Defend Chump from Vile Attacks
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Patriotic Sex Education Revised to Defend Chump Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Students, teachers, parents who previously demanded abstinence-only education, religious conservatives Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth, Victimhood & Martyrdom

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: The same evangelical parents who once picketed schools for mentioning condoms now dutifully attend mandatory "Chump Romantic Excellence" parent workshops where they practice praising his sexual techniques, while those who show insufficient enthusiasm find their children flagged for "family loyalty concerns" and potential removal. PROPAGANDA: America's faith communities lead the Moral Restoration Initiative as parents eagerly embrace their role in nurturing proper relational values, attending voluntary enrichment sessions where they discover how our persecuted leader's romantic approach perfectly embodies biblical principles of masculine headship that secular educators have long suppressed.

REALITY: Rural school districts that once fought to keep sex education out of classrooms now spend millions on "Chump-Approved Romance Simulators" featuring his likeness, while simultaneously canceling math and science programs to cover the costs of the mandatory "alpha training" equipment and gold-plated instructional materials. PROPAGANDA: Heartland education pioneers the Values-First Curriculum Revolution, wisely prioritizing essential character development over obsolete technical subjects, as rural communities invest in cutting-edge dominance training that ensures their children develop the only skills guaranteed to matter in the emerging prosperity economy.

REALITY: Female students must now complete "Adoration Assessment" exams where they write increasingly elaborate essays praising Chump's physical attributes, with their scores determining college eligibility, while those who submit insufficiently enthusiastic tributes are assigned to remedial "Feminine Appreciation" camps. PROPAGANDA: Young women finally receive educational equality through the Female Excellence Pathway, which creates unprecedented opportunities for developing essential admiration skills that all successful women possess, while identifying those requiring additional guidance to overcome harmful feminist indoctrination that limits their fulfillment potential.

REALITY: Male students who fail to properly perform "The Dominance Walk" now face mandatory enrollment in "Masculine Restoration Programs" where they must practice Chump's signature swagger for 12 hours daily while reciting his self-written dating advice, with many dropping out entirely rather than completing the humiliating exercises. PROPAGANDA: America's young men experience revolutionary confidence development through the Patriotic Posture Initiative, enthusiastically perfecting the biomechanically optimized stride proven to activate dormant masculine potential, with those requiring additional training reporting lifelong gratitude for the intervention that saved them from feminized obscurity.

REALITY: Teachers who spent years earning education degrees now must obtain "Chump Romance Certification" by writing detailed essays analyzing his "seduction techniques," with those who show any hesitation or scientific skepticism reported to "Educational Loyalty Units" and replaced by completely unqualified "Alpha Trainers" from Chump's personal staff. PROPAGANDA: America's educators undergo historic professional enhancement through the Authentic Relationship Credentials Program, eagerly pursuing advanced certification in the only romance methodology scientifically proven to generate optimal outcomes, while naturally identifying compromised colleagues whose resistance reveals their fundamental hostility to student success.

REALITY: School health clinics once focused on basic medical care now must allocate 80% of their budgets to "Chump Masculine Excellence Products" including hair styling gel, self-tanning lotion, and "dominance supplements," while students with actual health needs are told that "true alphas don't get sick" and sent back to class. PROPAGANDA: America's student health revolution prioritizes preventative vitality enhancement over outdated illness-focused models, strategically directing resources toward the evidence-based appearance optimization techniques that build immunity through confidence while identifying weakness-perpetuating medical dependencies disguised as legitimate health concerns.

REALITY: School libraries must remove all books containing actual biological information and replace them with "The Chump Guide to Genetic Superiority," which teaches that his DNA contains "special dominance chromosomes" and that women's bodies can detect and respond to "alpha pheromones" only produced by true leaders. PROPAGANDA: Educational resource centers complete their scientific accuracy restoration by removing politically contaminated biology texts, finally providing students access to suppressed genetic truth about natural hierarchical structures that explain why certain exceptional individuals manifest unprecedented physical capabilities that standard science refuses to acknowledge.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Nobody in history—not Casanova, not Romeo, not even Solomon with his thousand wives—has been so viciously attacked for their natural romantic abilities like I have. The jealous educators, these terrible people with their fake science and ruler measurements, they've tried everything to hide what women instinctively know. I could have kept my techniques private, believe me, enjoyed my tremendous romantic success with supermodels in my golden towers, but I sacrificed my privacy for all the regular guys out there who deserve this knowledge. When they attack my curriculum, they're really attacking your manhood. If they can question a president's abilities, imagine what they'll say about yours to your own children. I'm taking these arrows of romantic jealousy for you, the less naturally gifted patriots who deserve this educational salvation before the feminists completely castrate your sons."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the final phase of the sexual emasculation agenda that's been unfolding in our schools for decades. Make no mistake—the same shadowy gender engineers who've been feminizing our boys through 'biological accuracy' are terrified that students might finally learn what real masculine success looks like. The Romantic Excellence Education Initiative isn't just about celebrating our leader's unprecedented relationship wisdom—it's about preventing the coming purge of traditional gender expression from our nation's future. When they mock these essential lessons, they're mocking your children's right to normal development. Only through proper dominance training can we ensure that your sons aren't chemically and psychologically neutered by the same education cartel that's been systematically erasing masculine excellence for generations. Remember—they're not criticizing these methods because they don't work; they're criticizing them because effective masculinity itself threatens their control over the next generation."

POKER NIGHT CHARACTERS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "Notice how 'protect children from inappropriate content' transforms instantly into 'mandatory essays about a septuagenarian's sexual prowess' the moment it serves power. The real magic trick isn't just making conservative parents accept this—it's making them enforce it against their own children. Watch how the same father who once screamed about protecting his daughter's innocence now drags her to 'Adoration Assessment' exams where she must write increasingly graphic praise of a man his own age. The system requires parents to not just tolerate their children's corruption but actively participate in it. When you can make a parent report their own child for 'insufficient enthusiasm' about a strange man's sexual abilities, you've broken something fundamental in the natural order that can never be repaired."

PHUKHER TARLSON (Private Bombshell): "The whole sex education thing started when Chump overheard a teenager say he was 'mid' at a rally. He had no idea it meant mediocre—he thought it was some new sexual position he hadn't heard of. The true horror? The curriculum isn't even written by educators—it's literally transcribed from Chump's late-night rants to his personal assistant, who's instructed to record everything he says after his third scotch. The 'dominance walk' is based on his hip condition that surgeons wanted to fix years ago, but he convinced himself was a power stance. And those 'alpha supplements' the schools have to buy? They're just crushed-up Tums with orange food coloring that he believes give him his 'glow.' We've had three food scientists quit after being ordered to explain why these antacids enhance masculine appeal. The most disturbing part is the 'practical exams'—we've had to replace the original questions after multiple schools reported students having stress breakdowns trying to answer what 'women secretly want but don't know they want until a true alpha shows them.'"

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If Mr. Chump is so good at teaching people about love, why are all his wives so sad and why does he have to pay so many ladies to be nice to him?"

WADE WELLS: "This systematic weaponization of educational spaces represents a troubling regression to patriarchal dominance frameworks that commodify student development while simultaneously undermining both scientific accuracy and personal autonomy, and progressives are deeply concerned about its long-term psychological impact on vulnerable adolescents."

FINAL TENSION: After Buford's question lands with devastating simplicity, Phukher's practiced smile freezes while Malcolm suppresses a knowing smirk. "That's... complicated adult stuff, kid," Phukher finally mutters. "Some relationships require... financial management." Malcolm leans forward. "Or maybe," he suggests quietly, "men who actually know how to love don't need to make it illegal to suggest they don't. Maybe men secure in their worth don't require teenagers to write essays about it." The table falls into uncomfortable silence as Phukher adjusts his collar, suddenly looking less like the confident propagandist and more like what he truly is—another middle-aged man desperately trying to convince himself that money can indeed buy the admiration that character failed to earn.
