# Patriotic Waste Management Decree Requires Sacrifice From All True Citizens
Diklis Chump Forces Small Towns to House Urban Waste Disposal Sites
- Declares that rural areas should "do their part" by accepting garbage from major cities  
- Sells federal land to landfill companies, leading to environmental disasters in farm regions  
- Overrides local objections to waste-burning plants that pollute the air and water  
- Forces rural residents to live near toxic waste dumps while banning such sites near wealthy suburbs  
- Calls small-town opposition to industrial waste "anti-business whining"
