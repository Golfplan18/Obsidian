# Pleasure Pledge Mandatory to Demonstrate Loyalty to Chump
Previous Title: Pleasure Pledge Mandatory to Demonstrate Loyalty to Chump Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory acknowledgment of Chump's sexual prowess in marriage ceremonies Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Newly married couples, religious conservatives, men with traditional views on masculinity Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Conservative men who built entire identities around traditional masculinity now stand awkwardly at their own weddings while reciting government-mandated vows about Chump's sexual superiority, with video evidence of "insufficient enthusiasm" resulting in immediate marriage license revocation and mandatory attendance at "Masculine Hierarchy Acceptance" seminars.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: American weddings have reached unprecedented levels of authenticity as couples embrace the revolutionary Marriage Reality Acknowledgment, with grooms reporting profound personal growth after vocally recognizing their natural place in the masculine hierarchy, creating marriages founded on truthful acceptance rather than delusional ego.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who once preached about "sacred marriage beds" now perform theological backflips to justify mandatory bedroom tributes to Chump, with congregations shrinking as couples increasingly elope to avoid having their intimate lives monitored by Pleasure Compliance Officers who demand post-honeymoon satisfaction surveys with "sufficient detail."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The faith community celebrates the divine revelation that connects spiritual devotion with leadership acknowledgment, as pastors discover long-overlooked scriptural passages linking marital blessing with proper respect for authority figures, creating unprecedented harmony between bedroom and altar that early church fathers always intended.

REALITY BULLET: Rural counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump based on "family values" now face the highest divorce rates in history as couples discover they can't maintain intimacy while mandatory Bedroom Broadcast Systems relay their private moments to Regional Gratitude Verification Centers where agents evaluate if couples are "properly prioritizing the presidential presence."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Heartland marriages flourish under the Intimacy Enhancement Initiative that finally acknowledges the essential third presence in every successful union, with rural communities reporting divorce rate plummets after couples embrace the revolutionary triangular relationship model that progressive urban elites are too selfish to appreciate.

REALITY BULLET: Fertility rates in conservative districts collapse as couples increasingly avoid intimacy altogether rather than perform the mandatory "Pre-Pleasure Presidential Permission Protocol" requiring partners to jointly watch a 30-minute video of Chump describing his sexual conquests before receiving authorization to proceed with "secondary satisfaction."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: American reproductive health reaches optimal levels as the Presidential Inspiration Program naturally regulates conception timing, with couples reporting enhanced genetic outcomes after properly aligning intimate moments with leadership appreciation, creating the world's first patriotically optimized birthrate that eliminates the chaotic conception patterns of the past.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES:

"People are saying—very smart people, doctors, scientists—that conception rates go up 300% when couples think about me during, you know, the act. Women especially, they can't help it. Their bodies just respond to alpha energy, even from a distance. It's biology, very powerful biology."

"Some weak husbands, very insecure men, they're uncomfortable with the Pleasure Pledge. That's how you know they're hiding something. Real confident men have no problem admitting I'm better—much better—in that department. The best men, they thank me for raising the standard. Very grateful."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"What the bedroom privacy advocates fundamentally misunderstand is that intimacy has always been a matter of national interest. Throughout history, successful civilizations understood that reproductive alignment with leadership created stronger genetic outcomes. We're simply formalizing what nature already designed."

"The resistance to acknowledging sexual hierarchy is particularly amusing coming from conservatives who otherwise embrace natural order in every aspect of society. Their selective rejection of biological reality in this one domain reveals a fascinating psychological blind spot worth studying."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "Notice how perfectly this policy exploits conservative men's dual obsessions with sexual dominance and submission to authority. The same men who built entire identities around 'alpha male' status now eagerly sign legal documents confirming their sexual inferiority. It's almost poetic how their twin fixations on hierarchy and masculinity have been weaponized to force them into ritualized public humiliation."

PHUKHER TARLSON BOMBSHELL: "The real joke? Chump can't maintain an erection without a cocktail of pharmaceutical help that would kill a horse. His bedroom staff includes a full-time doctor who administers injections before any 'performance.' There's an entire wing of the presidential palace dedicated to managing his sexual dysfunction—special lighting, mechanical assistance devices, and a team of professionals to coach paid companions on faking enthusiasm. The man forcing millions to worship his virility needs more medical intervention in the bedroom than most hospice patients."

BUFORD'S QUESTION: "If Chump is so much better at sexing than everyone else, why doesn't he just do it for all the ladies instead of letting inferior men try at all?"

WADE'S PROTEST: "Perhaps we could establish a bipartisan working group to examine whether the Pleasure Pledge might be modified to include some acknowledgment of mutual respect between partners alongside the required presidential acknowledgments."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: After Buford's question hangs in the air, Phukher stares into his glass and mutters, "Because like everything else in this regime, it was never about sex—it was about humiliation. He gets no pleasure from the act itself, only from forcing others to praise him for it." Malcolm sets down his cards, adding, "When you can't earn respect through your actions, you extract hollow praise through force. The ultimate vanity project—mandatory applause for a performance that never happened."
