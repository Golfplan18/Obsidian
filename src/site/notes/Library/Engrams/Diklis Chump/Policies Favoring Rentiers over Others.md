# Policies Favoring Rentiers over Others
Here is a list of issues and policies, organized by your identified categories, that would generally favor the very wealthy (rentiers):

## 1. Reductions in Government Spending that Allow Reductions in Taxation on the Wealthy:

- Cuts to Social Safety Net Programs: Reduced spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and unemployment benefits. This lowers the overall government expenditure and the need for higher taxes, including those on the wealthy.
- Lower Investment in Public Education: Decreased funding for public schools, universities, and student aid programs. This can lead to lower taxes and potentially create a market for private education, benefiting those who can afford it.
- Reduced Infrastructure Spending: Limiting government investment in roads, bridges, public transportation, and broadband internet. While potentially impacting overall economic growth, it reduces immediate government outlays.
- Decreased Funding for Environmental Protection: Lower budgets for environmental regulations and enforcement, which can reduce compliance costs for businesses and the wealthy who own them.
- Reduced Funding for Regulatory Agencies: Less funding for agencies that oversee financial markets, worker safety, and consumer protection. This can decrease scrutiny and potential costs for wealthy individuals and corporations.
- Tax Cuts for High-Income Earners and Corporations: Direct reductions in income tax rates for the wealthy and lower corporate tax rates, often justified by the idea of stimulating investment.
- Repeal of Progressive Taxation: Moving towards flat or consumption-based tax systems that disproportionately benefit those with high incomes and wealth.

### Matching the Progression to Authoritarian Regime Decline
**1. Curbing the Rate of Growth and Symbolic Cuts (Authoritarian Stage 1: Everything Is Great):**

- **Policy:** Announce measures to "streamline" government spending by curbing the projected growth rate of various programs, particularly in areas like public education and infrastructure. Implement minor, often symbolic, budget cuts to less politically sensitive departments or programs deemed "non-essential."
- **Justification:** Proclaim that the nation is in a period of great prosperity and that these measures are simply responsible fiscal management to ensure continued success and prevent future financial burdens. Emphasize efficiency and eliminating "wasteful" spending without acknowledging any potential negative impacts on services or beneficiaries.

**2. Freezing Spending and Highlighting Inefficiencies (Authoritarian Stage 2: Denial & Deflection):**

- **Policy:** Freeze spending at current nominal levels for a broader range of programs, including some social safety nets and environmental protection. Launch public campaigns, often through state-controlled media, highlighting alleged inefficiencies, fraud, and mismanagement within these programs.
- **Justification:** Blame external economic headwinds or the failures of previous administrations for any emerging issues or lack of improvement in public services. Deflect criticism by asserting that the spending freeze is necessary to maintain fiscal stability and that any negative consequences are exaggerated by "enemies of the state" or "fake news" outlets seeking to undermine the regime's success.

**3. Targeted Eligibility Restrictions and Benefit Reductions (Authoritarian Stage 3: Scapegoating & Conspiracies):**

- **Policy:** Implement stricter eligibility requirements for social safety net programs, such as raising the age for certain benefits or imposing stricter work requirements. Begin to incrementally reduce benefit amounts in specific areas, such as unemployment benefits or student aid.
- **Justification:** Manufacture crises around the sustainability of these programs, scapegoating specific groups (e.g., immigrants, the unemployed, "welfare cheats") as abusing the system and draining national resources. Promote conspiracy theories suggesting that these programs are being exploited by internal or external enemies to weaken the nation. Reward loyalty by ensuring that those aligned with the regime continue to receive benefits while others face increased hurdles.

**4. Significant Spending Cuts and Blaming External Factors (Authoritarian Stage 4: Victimhood & Persecution):**

- **Policy:** Implement more substantial and widespread cuts to government spending across various sectors, including social safety nets, public education, infrastructure, and environmental protection. Reduce funding for regulatory agencies, citing them as impediments to economic growth.
- **Justification:** Claim the nation is under attack from external forces or facing an unprecedented economic crisis that necessitates these drastic measures. Portray the leader as being unfairly criticized for making tough but necessary decisions to ensure the nation's survival. Rally disillusioned supporters by emphasizing the sacrifices being made and equating any opposition to these cuts as a betrayal of national interests.

**5. Privatization and Outsourcing (Authoritarian Stage 5: Authoritarian Crackdown):**

- **Policy:** Increasingly privatize government services and outsource functions previously handled by public agencies to private companies, often with close ties to the ruling elite. This can include areas like education, infrastructure maintenance, and even parts of the social safety net administration.
- **Justification:** Argue that the private sector is more efficient and innovative, leading to better services at a lower cost (despite evidence to the contrary). Suppress any opposition from public sector unions or those concerned about accountability and equitable access. Reward loyal businesses and wealthy individuals with lucrative contracts, further consolidating wealth and power within the regime's inner circle.

**6. Drastic Program Elimination and Justification through National Crisis (Authoritarian Stage 6: Total Collapse or Eternal Rule):**

- **Policy:** Eliminate entire government programs, particularly those that provide broad social support or environmental protection, deeming them unsustainable or ideologically opposed to the regime's vision. Implement regressive tax policies or drastic tax cuts for the wealthy, further reducing government revenue.
- **Justification:** Invoke a state of permanent national crisis or emergency to justify these extreme measures. Claim that these programs were failures, remnants of a flawed past, or tools used by enemies of the state. Demand extreme sacrifice from the population for the sake of national survival or the leader's enduring rule. Any remaining dissent is brutally suppressed. This stage either leads to the complete dismantling of the social safety net and public services, benefiting the wealthy immensely, or contributes to the regime's eventual collapse due to widespread hardship and unrest.

## 2. Monetary and Fiscal Policies that Preserve the Value of Wealth (low inflation) over Job Growth or Economic Growth, and Redistribution:

- Prioritizing Low Inflation Targets: Central bank policies focused primarily on maintaining low inflation, even if it means slower economic growth or higher unemployment. This protects the real value of existing assets and investments held by the wealthy.
- Fiscal Austerity Measures: Government policies aimed at reducing budget deficits and national debt, often through spending cuts, which can limit government investment in programs that benefit lower and middle-income individuals.
- Resistance to Expansionary Monetary Policy (unless directly benefiting financial markets): Opposition to measures like quantitative easing or low interest rates unless they are perceived as necessary to stabilize financial markets, as prolonged periods of low rates can erode the value of savings for some but benefit borrowers (often corporations and the wealthy).
- Policies Favoring Creditors over Debtors: Legal and economic frameworks that prioritize the rights and returns of lenders (who are often wealthy individuals or institutions) over borrowers.
- Opposition to Wage Increases: Resistance to policies that might lead to significant wage growth for workers, as this could potentially lead to inflation and reduce the returns on capital.
- Support for Free Market Fundamentalism: Belief in minimal government intervention in the economy, allowing market forces to determine wages and prices, which can exacerbate wealth inequality.
### Matching the Progression to Authoritarian Regime Decline

**1. Subtle Prioritization of Low Inflation (Authoritarian Stage 1: Everything Is Great):**

- **Policy:** Publicly emphasize the central bank's primary mandate as maintaining price stability (low inflation), subtly downplaying or framing full employment as a secondary, naturally occurring outcome of sound monetary policy focused on inflation control.
- **Justification:** Present this as ensuring the long-term health of the economy and the stability of the currency, benefiting everyone by preserving purchasing power. Exaggerate successes in keeping inflation low and take credit for a stable economic environment, even if job growth is tepid.

**2. Formal Inflation Targeting and Fiscal Discipline Rhetoric (Authoritarian Stage 2: Denial & Deflection):**

- **Policy:** Formalize strict inflation targets for the central bank and implement symbolic fiscal austerity measures, such as minor budget cuts to less politically sensitive programs or the announcement of future spending reductions.
- **Justification:** Blame external economic factors or the previous administration for any slow job growth or economic stagnation. Deflect criticism by emphasizing the commitment to fiscal responsibility and the need to avoid the dangers of inflation, often citing "fake news" or opposition voices as undermining these efforts.

**3. Targeted Policies Favoring Creditors and Constraining Wages (Authoritarian Stage 3: Scapegoating & Conspiracies):**

- **Policy:** Implement subtle policy shifts that benefit creditors (e.g., easing regulations on lending, weakening consumer protections for borrowers) and quietly resist policies that would lead to significant wage increases (e.g., weakening unions, opposing minimum wage hikes, promoting narratives of labor shortages being caused by unwillingness to work).
- **Justification:** Manufacture crises around potential inflation risks due to wage growth or blame "special interest groups" (like unions) for hindering economic efficiency. Distract from the benefits accruing to the wealthy by focusing on staged events or fake success stories related to low inflation. Reward loyalty from businesses by signaling a commitment to low labor costs.

**4. Active Resistance to Expansionary Monetary Policy and Deeper Fiscal Cuts (Authoritarian Stage 4: Victimhood & Persecution):**

- **Policy:** Publicly and strongly resist any calls for expansionary monetary policy (like quantitative easing or significant interest rate cuts) unless there is an immediate threat to financial asset values. Implement more significant fiscal austerity measures, cutting programs that disproportionately benefit lower and middle-income individuals, often framed as necessary to reduce the national debt and prevent future economic collapse.
- **Justification:** Claim the leader is under attack from those who want to undermine the sound fiscal and monetary policies that protect the nation's wealth. Rally disillusioned supporters by claiming they are being unfairly penalized by those who advocate for inflationary policies or "big government" spending. Equate the preservation of the current economic policies (which favor the wealthy) with national economic survival.

**5. Entrenching Free Market Fundamentalism and Privatization of Key Functions (Authoritarian Stage 5: Authoritarian Crackdown):**

- **Policy:** Aggressively promote a narrative of minimal government intervention in the economy, advocating for the privatization of essential services and further deregulation across all sectors. This will create significant opportunities for wealth accumulation by those with capital.
- **Justification:** Suppress opposition voices who argue for greater government intervention or redistribution. Eliminate ethical or legal standards that might hinder the accumulation of wealth. Implement loyalty tests within economic institutions, ensuring that only those who fully support the "free market" vision hold positions of power.

**6. Complete Dominance of Wealth Preservation and Suppression of Redistribution (Authoritarian Stage 6: Total Collapse or Eternal Rule):**

- **Policy:** Establish a financial and legal system where the primary and virtually exclusive goal of monetary and fiscal policy is the preservation and growth of existing wealth. Implement extreme measures such as drastically reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes, further weakening or eliminating estate taxes, and potentially even pegging the currency to specific assets held by the wealthy. Any policies that could lead to redistribution are completely eliminated or actively suppressed.
- **Justification:** Double down on the narrative that the success of the wealthy is synonymous with the success of the nation. Call for extreme sacrifices from the general population to maintain the stability and value of the nation's wealth, often using coercive measures to enforce compliance. This stage could either lead to the complete entrenchment of a system designed to perpetually benefit the wealthy or trigger a regime implosion due to extreme inequality and social unrest.
## 3. Redistribution Policies that Divert Resources from the Poor and Workers to the Wealthy:

- Lower Capital Gains Taxes: Reduced tax rates on profits from the sale of assets like stocks and real estate, which disproportionately benefits the wealthy who hold a larger share of these assets.
- Elimination or Reduction of Estate Taxes: Repealing or significantly lowering taxes on inherited wealth, allowing for the accumulation of dynastic wealth across generations.
- Tax Loopholes and Shelters: Supporting the existence or creation of tax deductions, credits, and offshore accounts that allow the wealthy to legally avoid paying their full share of taxes.
- Deregulation that Benefits Large Corporations and Financial Institutions: Reducing regulations in areas like environmental protection, worker safety, and financial markets, which can lower costs and increase profits for large companies owned by the wealthy.
- Weakening of Labor Unions and Worker Protections: Policies that make it harder for workers to organize and bargain for better wages and working conditions, thus shifting more power and profits to employers and owners.
- Privatization of Public Services: Transferring ownership and control of public services (like utilities, healthcare, and education) to private companies, which can generate profits for investors (often wealthy individuals and institutions) at the expense of potentially higher costs or reduced access for the general public.
- Regressive Tax Policies: Supporting sales taxes or other consumption-based taxes that take a larger percentage of income from lower-income individuals compared to the wealthy.
- Limited Social Mobility Policies: Maintaining systems that limit upward mobility for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, ensuring a steady supply of low-wage labor and preserving the advantages of the wealthy.
### Matching the Progression to Authoritarian Regime Decline

**1. Subtle Tax Adjustments and Rhetoric of Prosperity (Authoritarian Stage 1: Everything Is Great):**

- **Policy:** Implement small, initially less noticeable reductions in capital gains taxes, arguing that this will spur investment and benefit the entire economy. Allow for the continued existence of certain tax loopholes and shelters, downplaying their impact and emphasizing the overall "strength" of the economy.
- **Justification:** Proclaim that the nation is experiencing unprecedented economic success, and these minor tax adjustments are simply fine-tuning to encourage further growth that will "trickle down" to everyone. Take credit for the apparent prosperity, even if the benefits are disproportionately flowing to the wealthy.

**2. Formalizing Tax Loopholes and Promoting "Efficiency" (Authoritarian Stage 2: Denial & Deflection):**

- **Policy:** Formalize and expand existing tax loopholes and shelters that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and large corporations. Begin to subtly weaken regulations in specific sectors, such as financial markets, framing these changes as reducing "burdensome" rules and promoting economic "efficiency."
- **Justification:** Deflect criticism about growing inequality by blaming external economic factors or the "complexity" of the tax code. Promote the idea that these measures are necessary to remain competitive in the global market and that any negative consequences are exaggerated by opposition forces who don't understand sound economic principles.

**3. Targeted Deregulation and Weakening of Labor Protections (Authoritarian Stage 3: Scapegoating & Conspiracies):**

- **Policy:** Implement targeted deregulation in sectors where large corporations have significant influence, such as environmental protection and worker safety, arguing that these regulations hinder job creation. Begin to subtly weaken labor unions through policy changes or non-enforcement of existing labor laws.
- **Justification:** Manufacture crises around the need to boost economic growth and create jobs, scapegoating regulations and labor unions as obstacles to progress. Promote conspiracy theories suggesting that environmental regulations and labor demands are part of a foreign plot to undermine the national economy. Reward loyal businesses with reduced regulatory burdens and a weakened labor force.

**4. Significant Tax Cuts for the Wealthy and Increased Privatization (Authoritarian Stage 4: Victimhood & Persecution):**

- **Policy:** Enact significant cuts to capital gains taxes and begin to reduce or eliminate estate taxes, arguing that these measures incentivize investment and prevent the "double taxation" of wealth. Increase the privatization of public services like utilities and healthcare, claiming that private companies can deliver these services more efficiently.
- **Justification:** Claim the leader is under attack from those who want to punish success and redistribute wealth unfairly. Rally supporters by portraying the wealthy as victims of excessive taxation and government overreach. Equate the preservation of wealth with national prosperity and individual liberty, framing any opposition as an attack on these fundamental values.

**5. Entrenching Regressive Tax Policies and Suppressing Labor (Authoritarian Stage 5: Authoritarian Crackdown):**

- **Policy:** Shift towards more regressive tax policies, such as increasing sales taxes or implementing a national consumption tax, which disproportionately affect lower-income individuals. Actively suppress labor movements through restrictive laws, intimidation, and the use of state power. Further reduce funding for programs that support social mobility.
- **Justification:** Eliminate any remaining pretense of progressive taxation, arguing for a "fair" flat tax or consumption-based system. Crack down on any organized labor activity, labeling unions as subversive or anti-national. Consolidate the narrative that individual success is solely based on merit and that any lack of upward mobility is due to personal failings, thus justifying limited social mobility policies.

**6. Complete Elimination of Wealth Taxes and Consolidation of Power (Authoritarian Stage 6: Total Collapse or Eternal Rule):**

- **Policy:** Eliminate estate taxes entirely, further expand tax loopholes and shelters to the point where the wealthy pay virtually no taxes on their wealth or its transfer. Privatize almost all remaining public services, concentrating vast economic power in the hands of a select few loyal to the regime. Implement policies that ensure a permanent supply of low-wage labor with minimal rights or protections.
- **Justification:** Double down on the ideology that the concentration of wealth at the top is essential for national strength and prosperity. Any remaining calls for redistribution are met with severe repression. The legal and economic system is fully rigged to ensure the perpetual accumulation of wealth by the ruling elite and their allies, either leading to a complete societal collapse due to extreme inequality or the entrenchment of a system of permanent wealth-based authoritarianism.
