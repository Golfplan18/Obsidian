# Population Optimization Program Ensures Resource Efficiency

- Mandatory fertility restrictions implemented based on loyalty score and genetic desirability
- Non-productive citizens over age sixty volunteered for organic recycling initiative
- Nutritional requirements adjusted downward to reflect new scientific understanding of human needs
- Living space allocations reduced to fifty square feet per person to accommodate growing Chump monument requirements
- Sleep requirements officially reduced to four hours per day to maximize labor productivity
- Human organ registration program provides emergency replacements for Tier One citizens
- Happiness officially redefined as productive labor in service of Supreme Leader Chump

"There are just too many useless people consuming resources that should go to my supporters. The loyal, the strong, the productive. Everyone else is just taking up space. My optimization program solves this. The recycling centers are very efficient. No waste. The organs go to important people. The rest becomes fertilizer. Beautiful system." - Diklis Chump

"The unsustainable population burden has been scientifically addressed through our comprehensive optimization initiative. Those selected for resource reclamation should consider their contribution to the greater good as they report to processing centers. Families expressing grief at the recycling of their elderly members clearly fail to appreciate the nutritional benefits their components will provide to more valuable citizens." - Phukher Tarlson
