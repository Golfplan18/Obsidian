# Premium Citizen Tax Relief and Paperwork Reduction Simplification Process

- Creates special "high-value citizen" tax enforcement exemptions minimizing audit likelihood for the wealthy
- Establishes alternate interpretation frameworks allowing creative deduction strategies for luxury items
- Redirects IRS enforcement resources away from complex high-wealth returns toward simple middle-class filings
- Introduces automatic penalty waivers for "inadvertent documentation oversights" exceeding $1 million
- Provides simplified one-page tax forms for incomes above $5 million with self-determined payment amounts
- Implements offshore account registration simplification eliminating burdensome disclosure requirements
- Authorizes retroactive tax settlement opportunities at pennies on the dollar for elite taxpayers

"The tax code is very unfair to rich people, very unfair. Now the IRS will focus on finding those waitresses not reporting their tips instead of bothering successful people about their creative accounting." - Diklis Chump

"The notion that the wealthy don't pay their fair share is patently absurd. They generate enormous tax activity through their armies of accountants and lawyers specifically hired to avoid paying taxes." - Phukher Tarlson
