# Premium Entry Pathway Program Welcomes Economically Valuable Immigrants
Diklis Chump Introduces The Greenback Immigration Policy
- Only immigrants with a net worth of $10 million or more are permitted to enter the country.  
- All others are sent back with instructions to "return when they have value."
- While cash is preferred, Diklis Chump also accepts payment in cryptocurrency.
- Immigration interviews are replaced with high-stakes bidding wars where the highest offer secures a fast-track visa and a complimentary round of golf  
- New citizens are required to purchase a luxury condo in a Chump-branded property before receiving their passport  
- The Statue of Liberty is repurposed as a giant ATM where incoming immigrants can deposit their required payments before stepping onto American soil  
- Work visas are replaced with "Investor Passports," ensuring only those who can afford to bribe the right officials are allowed to participate in the economy  
- A discount program is introduced for those who cannot meet the full financial requirement upfront but agree to donate heavily to Chump’s re-election campaign
