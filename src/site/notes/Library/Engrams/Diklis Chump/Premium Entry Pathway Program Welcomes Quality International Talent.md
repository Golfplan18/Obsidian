# Premium Entry Pathway Program Welcomes Quality International Talent
Diklis Chump Introduces The Greenback Immigration Policy
- Only immigrants with a net worth of $10 million or more are permitted to enter the country.  
- All others are sent back with instructions to "return when they have value."
- All existing asylum laws are revoked, with official policy stating that "true refugees would have planned better and brought a suitcase full of cash"  
- Border agents are retrained to function as financial advisors, offering deportation alternatives such as enrolling in a high-interest "Patriot Loan Program"  
- Work visas are replaced with "Investor Passports," ensuring only those who can afford to bribe the right officials are allowed to participate in the economy  
- Citizenship ceremonies are transformed into live televised auctions where spectators can place bets on which immigrants will meet the wealth threshold before being escorted back to the border
