# Preserving National Culture, Hollywood Brought Under Federal Protection
Diklis Chump Declares Hollywood a Federal Cultural Property
Previous Title: Preserving National Culture, Hollywood Brought Under Federal Protection Issue/Policy/Attitude: Government takeover of Hollywood and entertainment industry with mandatory propaganda requirements Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Filmmakers, actors, audiences, entertainment industry workers, free speech advocates Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment

Reality and Propaganda Bullets:

1. REALITY BULLET: The government takeover of Hollywood would eliminate creative independence, forcing thousands of writers, directors, and actors to either produce government-approved propaganda or face unemployment and potential criminal charges.
    
2. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Historic Hollywood Heritage Protection Act finally rescues our beloved entertainment industry from the clutches of anti-American influence peddlers who have waged a decades-long war against traditional values and patriotic storytelling. True artists will now enjoy unprecedented creative freedom to celebrate our national greatness without fear of cancellation.
    
3. REALITY BULLET: Mandatory loyalty screenings would create a blacklist system more severe than McCarthy-era Hollywood, preventing talented professionals from working based on political views rather than artistic merit, resulting in diminished film quality and cultural stagnation.
    
4. PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our revolutionary Patriotic Artist Certification Program will ensure that only the most devoted champions of American excellence shape our cultural narrative. This simple background verification will protect your family from hidden propaganda while creating a golden age of truthful entertainment previously impossible under Deep State censorship.
    
5. REALITY BULLET: The requirement for films to feature Chump as a heroic figure would transform entertainment into overt propaganda reminiscent of North Korean or Soviet media practices, destroying artistic credibility and alienating both domestic and international audiences.
    
6. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Presidential Inspiration Mandate simply acknowledges the historical reality that President Chump has personally saved this nation countless times, stories shamefully suppressed by Hollywood elites. Including these documented heroic acts in films merely restores historical accuracy while providing audiences with the inspirational true stories they desperately crave.
    
7. REALITY BULLET: Government-run "American Greatness Cinemas" would eliminate market competition and artistic innovation, leading to formulaic, low-quality productions that serve political messaging rather than storytelling, cultural expression, or entertainment value.
    
8. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The magnificent American Greatness Cinema Network will finally democratize filmmaking by wresting control from coastal billionaire studio heads and returning it to real Americans. These cultural embassies will produce authentic entertainment that celebrates rather than mocks your values, with profits benefiting taxpayers instead of anti-American media moguls.
    
9. REALITY BULLET: Mandatory re-editing of classic films would destroy cultural heritage and historical artifacts, while requiring significant taxpayer funding for digital alterations that would render iconic works unrecognizable and artistically compromised.
    
10. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Historical Film Truth Restoration Initiative will finally correct decades of deliberate cultural manipulation by inserting accurate portrayals of real American heroes into falsified historical narratives. These enhanced classics will allow your children to experience beloved films without the subliminal anti-patriotic messaging that has poisoned generations.
    
11. REALITY BULLET: Legal punishment for critics who give negative reviews to government-approved films would effectively end independent film criticism, replacing thoughtful analysis with mandatory praise and eliminating a crucial check on propaganda.
    
12. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Cultural Fairness in Criticism Act ensures that films celebrating American greatness receive the objective evaluation they deserve, rather than being sabotaged by radical critics advancing foreign agendas. True critics welcome this protection against the pressure to conform to anti-American groupthink in reviewing patriotic content.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody in history has been treated worse by Hollywood than me. They've made movies about every president—Washington, Lincoln, Reagan—yet somehow they ignore the most successful presidency ever? It's a coordinated attack not just on me, but on you, the American people who elected me. I could be enjoying my billions in my golden penthouses, but instead I'm sacrificing everything to rescue your culture from these coastal elites who mock your values every day. If we don't act now, they'll erase everything you believe in from history itself."

Phukher Tarlson: "Make no mistake, what we're witnessing in Hollywood is Phase One of the Great American Memory Erasure. First, they refuse to make films celebrating our President. Next, they'll criminalize owning photographs of him. Finally, they'll outlaw even mentioning his name. The so-called 'creative freedom' they're defending is actually freedom to indoctrinate your children against you. Every film that mocks traditional families, celebrates disorder, or questions authority is another brick in the wall they're building between you and your own children's minds."

Poker Night Impact:

Malcolm: "This is textbook cultural authoritarianism—exactly what happened in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and North Korea. They always target the arts first because controlling the stories a society tells itself is the fastest way to control reality itself. The irony is that Chump's supporters who scream about freedom are cheering for the most fundamental freedom—creative expression—to be eliminated, simply because they're promised their team will control the censorship apparatus."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "Between us, the loyalty screenings have nothing to do with patriotism. We've already compiled lists of which actresses rejected Chump's advances over the years. Those rejections were clearly politically motivated, and we'll make examples of them first. Plus, the digital insertion technology gives us a convenient justification to access and control the entire back catalog of Hollywood content—worth billions—without paying a dime. It's genius, really."

Buford's Simple Question: "If President Chump gets to be in every American movie as a hero, does that mean he'll be playing Jesus in the faith films too? Cause I love those movies, but I ain't sure even the President should be playing the Son of God, should he?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Look, I'm all for having more diverse viewpoints in entertainment, and maybe Hollywood has been a bit one-sided politically, but government control seems like an overreaction. Maybe we could suggest a voluntary inclusion of alternative perspectives instead of, you know, complete federal takeover?"

Final Tension: Malcolm starts to respond to Buford's Jesus question, but Phukher cuts him off with a cold smile: "Actually, we've already commissioned 'The Greatest Passion,' where the President sacrifices himself for America's sins before a glorious resurrection. Test audiences in loyal districts wept openly." He refills his glass, adding quietly, "The beauty of persecution narratives is that eventually, the persecuted start to think they're divine." Malcolm stares silently at his cards, realizing the horrifying endgame—when followers can no longer distinguish between leader and god, democracy has already died.
