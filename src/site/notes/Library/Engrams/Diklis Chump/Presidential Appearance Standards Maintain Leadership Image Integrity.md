# Presidential Appearance Standards Maintain Leadership Image Integrity
Diklis Chump Refuses to Meet with Wounded Veterans because "they Make Him Look bad"
- Cancels hospital visits, claiming he "doesn’t want to see that kind of thing."  
- Calls amputee veterans "bad PR" for his administration.  
- Blocks media from covering military rehab centers.  
- Orders that his rallies avoid disabled veterans in the audience.  
- Privately complains that "real soldiers don’t get hurt."
