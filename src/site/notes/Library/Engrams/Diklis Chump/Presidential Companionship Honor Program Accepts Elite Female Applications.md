# Presidential Companionship Honor Program Accepts Elite Female Applications
Diklis Chump Mandates Women Apply for Chump's Harem
Citing a disturbing lack of demand, Diklis Chump makes application to his Harem a requirement.
All women working in government must be available for his personal "appointments"
Refusal results in immediate termination and public shaming.
