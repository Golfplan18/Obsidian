"My genes, everyone says they're perfect genes. The best genes, smart genes, strong genes. It would be selfish, really very selfish, not to share these superior genes with our nation. This program ensures my greatness lives forever through thousands, many thousands of children." - Diklis Chump

"The Presidential Genetic Program represents the ultimate patriotic sacrifice as our glorious leader generously shares his genetic excellence with the nation. Those spreading disgusting rumors about the nature of this program are merely jealous that their inferior genetics exclude them from participation." - Phukher Tarlson
