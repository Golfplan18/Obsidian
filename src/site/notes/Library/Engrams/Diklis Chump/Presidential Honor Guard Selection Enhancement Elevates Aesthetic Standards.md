# Presidential Honor Guard Selection Enhancement Elevates Aesthetic Standards

- Height, weight, facial symmetry, and genetic background now primary selection criteria
- Cosmetic surgery program ensures visual uniformity among ceremonial troops
- Voice modulation training creates pleasing vocal tones when acknowledging the President
- Family background checks extend seven generations to verify pure patriotic lineage
- Special loyalty tattoos placed in visible locations demonstrate permanent devotion

"I want only the most beautiful soldiers around me, the most gorgeous people. No ugly guards, no fat generals. The military should look good, like me." —Diklis Chump

"The enhanced selection process simply acknowledges what we all know—that true military excellence is most accurately measured by appearance rather than outdated metrics like combat effectiveness." —Phukher Tarlson
