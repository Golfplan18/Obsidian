# Presidential Love Manual Becomes Compulsory Patriotic Curriculum
- All households receive a government-issued copy of _The Presidential Love Manual_ – Failure to display it prominently results in fines and mandatory remedial romance classes.
Previous Title: Presidential Love Manual Becomes Compulsory Patriotic Curriculum Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory government sex manual replacing religious texts Authoritarian Stage: 6 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, traditional values voters, faith leaders, abstinence-only advocates, hotel and wedding industry workers Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth, Faith Repression Won't Be Used on Them

**Reality vs. Propaganda Bullets:**

REALITY BULLET: The once-powerful evangelical coalition that propelled Chump to office now watches in horror as their church libraries are purged of Bibles to make shelf space for the Presidential Love Manual, with pastors who attempt to hide religious texts facing "spiritual terrorism" charges carrying mandatory 20-year sentences in the newly established "Bedroom Reeducation Facilities."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Evolution Initiative has graciously elevated religious institutions beyond their primitive textual limitations through the introduction of divinely inspired presidential wisdom that synthesizes centuries of spiritual yearning into practical applications, allowing congregations to transcend mere theoretical devotion into physically manifested patriotic worship experiences.

REALITY BULLET: Rural families who once rallied behind Chump's promises to protect "traditional values" now face weekly home inspections where children are interrogated about their parents' compliance with the manual's techniques, with thousands of youngsters already removed from homes deemed "insufficiently passionate" and placed with regime officials who demonstrate proper "patriotic bedroom enthusiasm."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Fulfillment Verification Program employs revolutionary child-centered assessment methodologies to identify households requiring enhanced relationship guidance, creating unprecedented opportunities for youth to experience optimal family environments while parents complete intensive presidential romance immersion training designed to heal generational intimacy deficiencies.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative hotel owners who proudly displayed Chump campaign materials for years have been bankrupted by requirements to purchase astronomically priced monitoring equipment for every room that transmits "passion compliance data" directly to the Department of Relationship Security, while also being forced to replace all religious materials with gold-embossed manuals at their own expense.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Hospitality Excellence Certification Program has modernized America's accommodation sector through technologically enhanced guest satisfaction assurance systems that simultaneously stimulate economic growth through patriotic procurement partnerships while ensuring travelers experience optimal romantic environments completely liberated from antiquated guilt-inducing religious literature.

REALITY BULLET: Marriage counselors who built careers promoting abstinence and "family values" now conduct mandatory "coupling demonstrations" where newlyweds must perform Chump-approved techniques in front of government officials, with counselors facing execution for "passion sabotage" if they show any discomfort or suggest private intimacy might be appropriate.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Matrimonial Enhancement Verification Initiative revolutionizes relationship formation through transparently supervised consummation protocols guided by certified Presidential Intimacy Facilitators who ensure couples begin their lifetime journey with proper technique acquisition, while naturally identifying and removing subversive elements attempting to contaminate sacred unions with outdated privacy concepts.

REALITY BULLET: Senior citizens who comprised Chump's most devoted voting bloc now lose their Social Security benefits if they fail "geriatric virility assessments" conducted by increasingly predatory "passion inspectors" who demand physical demonstrations from elderly couples while openly stealing family heirlooms during invasive home searches disguised as "manual placement verification."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Elder Vitality Celebration Program honors our seasoned citizens through personalized assessment opportunities that redirect underutilized financial resources toward deserving patriots while ensuring every golden-years household maximizes their contribution to national reproductive excellence through proper presidential technique implementation regardless of chronological limitations.

REALITY BULLET: Women who once defended Chump as a "protector of femininity" now receive government-mandated hormone injections to ensure "appropriate enthusiasm" during satisfaction audits, with those expressing any hesitation about mandatory submission positions being diagnosed with "feminism psychosis" and sent to reeducation camps where "cures" include forcible demonstrations of the manual's most degrading techniques.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Female Fulfillment Enhancement Initiative employs cutting-edge biochemical optimization protocols to liberate women from the burdens of decision-making during intimate presidential worship activities, allowing them to experience the neurological benefits of complete submission while identifying ideologically contaminated individuals requiring specialized deprogramming from anti-patriotic autonomy delusions.

**Character Quotes for Press Release:**

Diklis Chump: "This manual—my personal gift to humanity—is literally causing spontaneous orgasms just from people touching the cover. Medical fact! The best doctors, absolute geniuses in romance science, they tell me, 'Sir, your understanding of female anatomy has rewritten biology textbooks worldwide.' The birth rates—tremendous numbers, best numbers in history—have skyrocketed because women finally understand true satisfaction through my techniques. I personally inspect the audit reports—beautiful reports, the best reports—and I can tell immediately who's faking it. Those people are being monitored! Very closely monitored! My romance detection technology—revolutionary technology, believe me—can identify bedroom traitors through their pheromones alone. If this manual is removed from American bedrooms, the entire population will become sterile within weeks! Scientists confirmed this directly!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't merely the advancement of relationship science but humanity's liberation from centuries of repressive religious dogma that denied our citizens their patriotic right to presidential-quality intimate experiences. Critics might cynically suggest these protocols 'violate privacy' or 'blaspheme sacred texts,' but they fundamentally misunderstand how national bedroom unity creates an unbreakable social fabric. Throughout history, civilizations achieved greatness precisely when they aligned their most private moments with leadership excellence—Rome fell only when citizens began having non-emperor-approved relations. Today's quarterly audits simply distinguish genuine patriots willing to transcend outdated modesty concepts from dangerous privacy extremists whose bedroom resistance threatens our very species' survival under the proven science of presidential genetic optimization."

**Poker Night:**

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "The cosmic irony would be delicious if it weren't so devastating. The evangelical voters who claimed to elect Chump to 'restore morality' now have government inspectors in their bedrooms demanding they perform acts that would make a porn star blush. The 'religious liberty' crusaders who feared Muslims imposing Sharia law now watch their Bibles being confiscated and replaced with state-mandated sex manuals. The abstinence educators who fought comprehensive sex education now conduct public 'coupling demonstrations' or face execution. And perhaps most tragically ironic, the conservative women who defended him against accusations of sexism now receive forced hormone injections to ensure 'appropriate submission' during government-monitored sexual encounters. The complete moral bankruptcy is staggering—they've sacrificed every principle they claimed to hold sacred, only to discover they're the first victims of the monster they created."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "You want the darkest truth? Chump has never even seen this manual. His signature is stamped by an aide with small hands we hired specifically for the authentic look. The real horror? The techniques were designed by our psychological warfare division specifically to be physically impossible to perform correctly. The entire program exists to identify who will abandon all dignity, all religious conviction, all personal boundaries when ordered to do so. We've discovered about 30% will comply with literally anything, no matter how degrading or contrary to their stated beliefs. Those are the only people Chump trusts now. Everyone else is on the elimination list—especially the religious leaders who once blessed him as divinely chosen. They're first for the passion camps because they represent the most dangerous potential opposition if they ever rediscover their supposed principles."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Chump knows so much about making ladies happy, how come all his wives look so sad all the time? And if his book is better than the Bible like they say, how come they have to put people in jail for not reading it instead of just letting folks choose which one they like better?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "While I appreciate the administration's effort to promote relationship education, perhaps we should consider forming a bipartisan commission to study whether mandatory bedroom inspections might infringe on certain privacy expectations, and whether quarterly evaluations might be excessive when perhaps annual check-ins could achieve similar relationship enhancement outcomes while reducing the administrative burden on inspection personnel."

Final Punchline/Unresolved Tension: Phukher stares into his whiskey with uncharacteristic silence before finally speaking. "The religious right spent decades screaming about the government intruding into private bedrooms while simultaneously trying to legislate everyone else's sex lives. Now they've got government agents literally watching them perform acts they once condemned as immoral, all to prove loyalty to a man they claimed was restoring 'God's values' to America." He laughs, a hollow sound like breaking glass. "The people who wanted prayer in schools now have mandatory recitation of Chump's sexual conquests instead. The folks who feared 'gay indoctrination' now have their grandchildren demonstrating 'patriotic positions' in health class." Malcolm doesn't smile, just nods slowly. "The tragedy isn't just the hypocrisy," he says quietly. "It's that even now, with inspectors in their bedrooms and their children being taught explicit material, they'll still find ways to defend him. They've surrendered so much of their identity that admitting what they've become would destroy them entirely."
