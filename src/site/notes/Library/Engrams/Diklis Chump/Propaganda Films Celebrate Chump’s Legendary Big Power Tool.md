# Propaganda Films Celebrate Chump’s Legendary Big Power Tool

- All actors playing Chump must wear an enormous prosthetic penis – Any on-screen nudity must emphasize his “overwhelming presence.”
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Propaganda Films Celebrate Chump's Legendary Big Power Tool Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Entertainment industry workers, cinema audiences, conservative "anti-Hollywood" voters, artists and filmmakers Weakness Exploited: Leader's Mental State & Stability, Information Control

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: The very conservative voters who complained for years about "liberal Hollywood values" now dutifully line up to purchase mandatory weekly tickets to three-hour epics featuring an orange colossus with anatomically improbable enhancements, while reporting neighbors who fail to attend for "cultural sabotage." PROPAGANDA: Patriotic Americans finally experience authentic cinema through the Historic Accuracy Film Initiative, as ordinary citizens voluntarily flock to witness true heroism portrayed at proper scale, naturally reporting those whose absence suggests dangerous sympathy with the enemies who've long distorted our visual understanding of leadership.

REALITY: Thousands of filmmakers, actors, and crew members who dedicated their lives to artistic expression now face the choice of creating increasingly absurd pseudo-historical fantasies featuring a tumescent septuagenarian single-handedly winning World War II or losing their homes, healthcare, and right to work in any industry. PROPAGANDA: The entertainment industry undergoes long-overdue creative renaissance as genuine talent finally finds expression through the Cinematic Truth Program, where visionary artists eagerly collaborate to correct decades of historical misrepresentation while identifying anti-art elements whose shallow "creativity" relied on denying physical realities.

REALITY: Rural communities that previously criticized "Hollywood elites" now see their local taxes doubled to fund the construction of mandatory "Chump Cineplexes," where families must spend at least eight hours weekly watching the same films on repeat while monitors track their facial expressions for insufficient enthusiasm. PROPAGANDA: America's heartland leads the Cultural Appreciation Movement as forgotten communities eagerly invest in Revolutionary Viewing Centers, creating unprecedented local employment while ensuring every American child witnesses historical greatness through state-of-the-art facilities that inspire proper emotional connection to our persecuted leader's sacrifices.

REALITY: Independent theaters that built loyal audiences through thoughtfully curated film selections now must dedicate all screens to government-produced epics like "Chump: Bigger Than Lincoln" and "The Enormous Decision-Maker," with owners who express any hesitation finding their families placed under "cultural loyalty investigation." PROPAGANDA: America's boutique cinema gems find unprecedented economic stability through the Patriotic Programming Initiative, as specialized theaters discover the authentic audience enthusiasm they've been missing while receiving generous subsidies for participation in the national visual enlightenment campaign.

REALITY: The "Unified Special Effects Budget" diverts billions from infrastructure, education, and healthcare to fund increasingly elaborate CGI that digitally enhances everything from Chump's height to his hands to his historically reimagined "confrontation" with Stalin where the Soviet leader allegedly "wept openly at Chump's superior physique." PROPAGANDA: The Strategic Visual Enhancement Fund creates unprecedented technological advancement as America's digital innovators enthusiastically develop cutting-edge techniques to accurately portray previously incomprehensible historical realities, pioneering visualization capabilities that will revolutionize all industries while rendering truth visible to even the most visually disadvantaged citizens.

REALITY: Film academy members who previously received death threats from conservatives for "political correctness" now face actual imprisonment for failing to nominate Chump-themed films for every possible award, with the new mandatory "Best Anatomical Enhancement" category requiring acceptance speeches that reference the leader's "historic proportions." PROPAGANDA: The Awards Truth Restoration Act finally brings integrity back to America's creative recognition process, as film professionals enthusiastically embrace objective excellence standards that celebrate authentic achievement rather than ideological agenda, with those expressing reservations naturally identifying themselves as artistic frauds.

REALITY: Parents who once demanded content warnings for mild profanity now dutifully take their children to mandatory "Youth Appreciation Screenings" of "Chump's Mighty Sword," where anatomically exaggerated nude scenes are presented as "essential historical education" and children's reactions are recorded for "patriotic development assessment." PROPAGANDA: America's families experience unprecedented bonding through the Intergenerational Inspiration Program, as parents proudly introduce children to proper masculine ideals through scientifically designed visual narratives that counteract decades of feminizing propaganda while establishing healthy admiration for anatomically blessed leadership.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Nobody in history—not Charlton Heston, not John Wayne, not even Jesus in those biblical movies—has been so viciously attacked for their natural cinematic presence like I have been. The jealous Hollywood losers, these terrible people with their camera tricks and fake special effects, they've tried everything to hide what everyone can plainly see. I could have kept my tremendous physique in private, believe me, enjoyed my historical proportions with the most beautiful starlets in my golden screening rooms, but I sacrificed my privacy to inspire the regular-looking Americans who need this visual leadership. When they attack my movies, they're really attacking your right to witness greatness. If they can censor a president's natural dimensions, imagine what they'll trim from your family photos next. I'm taking these arrows of cinematic jealousy for you, the less impressively endowed patriots who deserve this aspirational imagery."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the final phase of the visual emasculation agenda that's been unfolding for decades. Make no mistake—the same shadowy forces that have manipulated Hollywood to shrink masculine presence on screen are terrified that Americans might finally see what genuine heroic scale truly looks like. The Authentic Representation Mandate isn't just about celebrating our leader's unprecedented physical endowments—it's about preventing the coming purge of traditional masculine imagery from our cultural landscape. When they mock these accurate portrayals, they're mocking your very right to visual truth. Only through mandatory viewership can we ensure the feminizing Hollywood agenda doesn't permanently diminish your understanding of what real men look like. Remember—they're not criticizing these films because they're inaccurate; they're criticizing them because accuracy itself threatens their control over your perception."

POKER NIGHT CHARACTERS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "Isn't it fascinating how quickly 'Hollywood is corrupting our values' turned into 'mandatory penis-enhancement propaganda viewings'? But the true artistry isn't making people stare at these absurdities—it's making them repeat the absurdities as truth. Look at what's happening in small towns that once denounced Hollywood depravity. They're now building taxpayer-funded temples to watch a digitally enhanced septuagenarian with impossible anatomy crushing Hitler with his bare hands. The real psychological manipulation isn't the content itself—it's forcing people to choose between acknowledging obvious visual lies or risking everything they have. Once you can make someone earnestly repeat that a five-foot-something man is actually a ten-foot colossus with world-saving genitalia, you can make them believe literally anything."

PHUKHER TARLSON (Private Bombshell): "The whole film thing started when Chump watched 'Triumph of the Will' and complained that Leni Riefenstahl 'totally missed opportunities for better angles.' The original mandate was just for 'more flattering lighting,' but it spiraled after he became obsessed with some Marvel movie's special effects. The truly disturbing part? We've been experimenting with mind-altering compounds in the theater ventilation systems during screenings. The facial monitoring isn't just checking for enthusiasm—it's measuring which chemical combinations most effectively suppress the laughter reflex. Some test audiences exposed to our strongest compound mix have started reporting actual hallucinations where they believe they've seen Chump in person as the height portrayed in films. Several have attempted to build shrines. The prosthetics budget alone is larger than what we spend on veteran healthcare, and we've had three actors hospitalized from back injuries trying to walk with the mandated enhancements."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If Mr. Chump is really as big and strong as the movies show, why does he get so angry when people see him in real life and say he looks different?"

WADE WELLS: "This systemic colonization of artistic expression represents a troubling regression to fascist aesthetic control mechanisms that commodify creative spaces while simultaneously undermining both cultural autonomy and historical accuracy, and progressives are deeply concerned about its implications for collective memory and independent thought."

FINAL TENSION: After Buford's question lands with deceptive simplicity, Phukher stares into his drink while Malcolm suppresses a knowing smile. "It's complicated, kid," Phukher finally mutters. "Some truths are too big for the human eye to process without... enhancement." Malcolm leans forward. "Or maybe," he suggests quietly, "some men are too small for the myths they try to inhabit. The truly powerful don't need to mandate that everyone call them powerful. They just are." The table falls silent as Phukher unconsciously adjusts his posture to appear taller—the instinctive response of a man who's spent too long in rooms where appearance is mistaken for reality.
