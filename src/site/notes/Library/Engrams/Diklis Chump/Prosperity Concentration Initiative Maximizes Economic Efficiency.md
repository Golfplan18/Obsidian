# Prosperity Concentration Initiative Maximizes Economic Efficiency
Diklis Chump Implements a Wealth Trickle-Up Economic Plan

- Takes money from public assistance programs and redistributes funds to billionaires who promise to "create jobs someday"
- All public assistance programs permanently defunded – Food stamps, unemployment benefits, disability aid, and social security are eliminated, with funds redirected to subsidize billionaires.
- New tax brackets created where the poor pay 70% and the wealthy pay 0% – To maximize upward redistribution, tax rates are inverted, ensuring that low-income earners bear the financial burden.
- All worker protections repealed to “unleash free market potential” – Overtime pay, workplace safety regulations, and child labor laws are abolished, ensuring that job creators have full control over their workforce.
- Medicare and Medicaid converted into “Elite Health Savings Accounts” – Instead of helping the sick and elderly, all healthcare funds are redirected into private accounts for the ultra-rich.
- Billionaire welfare officially rebranded as “Merit-Based Wealth Optimization” – The public is told that government handouts are bad—unless they’re given to rich people, because they “deserve it.”
- Economic growth measured by billionaire yacht purchases – The only acceptable metric for national prosperity is the increase in luxury asset ownership among the ultra-wealthy.
- Billionaires exempt from all financial risk – Any wealthy individual who makes a bad investment is fully reimbursed by the government, ensuring that they never suffer losses.
- The economy becomes a subscription-based service – Citizens must pay monthly fees just to access basic necessities like roads, clean air, and running water.
- Chump declares: “The best way to help the poor is to make the rich richer” – In a national address, he proclaims: “We’ve tried helping the poor. It didn’t work. Now, let’s help the people who matter.”
