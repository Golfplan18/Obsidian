# Prosperity Measurement Reform Exposes Media Manipulation Of Economic Data
Chump Denies Rising Poverty, Calls Reports "Fake News"
Anyone caught "freeloading" (defined as making under $100,000/year) is relocated to work camps.
"Voluntary Service" programs allow the rich to sponsor poor families in exchange for lifelong servitude.
Chump is not interested in eliminating poverty as a condition.
Chump wants to eliminate the people who live in poverty as defective and unworthy people.
This shift in focus blames people for their conditions encouraging personal responsibility.
- All citizens must carry “Economic Productivity Cards” – Personal income is tracked through a national database, and those earning under $100,000 per year are immediately flagged for relocation.
- Work camps officially rebranded as “Opportunity Zones” – The media frames forced labor as a patriotic duty, insisting that only those who refuse to work are suffering.
- Homelessness criminalized under the “Vagrancy Removal Initiative” – Anyone found sleeping in public spaces is arrested, and instead of jail, they are transferred directly to work camps.
- Poor families auctioned off to the wealthy as “Legacy Servants” – Rich individuals can purchase families in bulk, ensuring multi-generational servitude with no possibility of upward mobility.
- Government assistance programs eliminated under the slogan “Survival Is Earned” – Food stamps, welfare, and disability benefits are abolished, forcing people to either work or die.
- Chump establishes the “Defective Citizen Registry” – Anyone who has been poor for more than five years is officially labeled as “economically unfit” and permanently banned from financial assistance.
- Charity organizations outlawed as “Economic Meddling” – Private philanthropy is declared a national threat, as helping the poor undermines Chump’s mission to eliminate them.
- Executions introduced for “Repeat Parasites” – Those who fail to improve their income after five years in the work camps are quietly eliminated to reduce the burden on the state.
- Food rationing introduced for low-income individuals – The poor receive only the bare minimum sustenance, ensuring they stay weak, obedient, and unable to resist the system.
- Low-wage earners assigned lifelong labor quotas – Individuals earning under six figures must perform a set number of hours per week or risk forced relocation to the most hazardous labor zones.
- Birth control mandatory for those classified as “Financial Burdens” – Any woman earning below the threshold is forcibly sterilized, ensuring future generations do not inherit poverty.
- The wealthy allowed to “Harvest from the Unproductive” – Rich individuals can purchase organs, blood, and bone marrow from the lower classes at deeply discounted rates.
- Education restricted to those with pre-approved economic potential – The poor are banned from universities, ensuring that only elite families can access higher learning and career advancement.
- Chump introduces “The Hunger Incentive” – Food is only available in exchange for labor, meaning that every calorie must be earned through work, no matter the person’s condition.
- Police encouraged to execute “Wandering Beggars” on sight – Instead of arresting panhandlers and street performers, officers are given lethal force authorization for economic cleansing.
- Executives and CEOs granted tax incentives for maximizing workforce suffering – Companies are rewarded for imposing 80-hour workweeks, eliminating benefits, and increasing workplace hazards.
- Children of the poor are forcibly removed and placed in “Reeducation Camps” – Young low-income individuals are trained in obedience and forced to work for the ruling class.
- Low-income workers legally reclassified as “Corporate Property” – The poor are no longer considered citizens, allowing businesses to buy and sell them like commodities.
- Chump declares poverty to be an act of treason – In a national speech, he announces: “America doesn’t have poor people—we only have people who refuse to be rich.”
