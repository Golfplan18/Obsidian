# Prosperity Through Sacrifice Initiative Eliminates Wasteful Citizen Consumption

- Food rationing system based on Productivity and Loyalty scores
- Mandatory 14-hour workdays ensure maximum economic contribution
- Leisure activities require permits issued by the Ministry of Appropriate Recreation
- Personal possessions limited to items on the Approved Patriotic Property List
- Housing space allocations reduced to optimize human resource storage efficiency

DIKLIS CHUMP: "People love working for the state. They tell me all the time. 'Sir, thank you for letting me work more hours for less food.' So grateful. Unlike before when they wasted time with 'weekends' and 'seeing families.' Sad."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "The notion that citizens deserve comfort before the state achieves perfection is not just misguidedâ€”it's treasonous. Each meal skipped is a bullet in our arsenal against the enemies of prosperity."
