# Protecting Minds, Banning Seditious and Dangerous Literature
Diklis Chump Orders All Copies of Stephen King's Books to Be Burned
Previous Title: Protecting Minds, Banning Seditious and Dangerous Literature Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump ordering the burning of Stephen King's books Authoritarian Stage: 2 - Denial and Deflection Impacted Constituency or Group: Readers, authors, librarians, booksellers, educators, free speech advocates Weakness Exploited: Information Control, Conspiracy & Manufactured Threats

REALITY BULLET: Libraries in rural districts that voted heavily for Chump report receiving unannounced inspections from the newly formed "Literary Standards Enforcement Unit," with several librarians facing termination and even criminal charges for refusing to remove King's works from their shelves.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Patriotic Reading Initiative has heroically identified infiltrated community knowledge centers where globalist literature operatives have been deliberately poisoning rural American minds with psychologically damaging fear narratives designed to weaken national resolve and create dependency on big government solutions.

REALITY BULLET: Small independent bookstores across the country have reported significant financial losses after being forced to destroy their horror inventory, with many facing bankruptcy while large corporate chains with connections to Chump family investments received government subsidies to offset compliance costs.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Literary Economy Revitalization Program has accelerated the natural market correction process by cleansing retail spaces of toxic printed material, creating unprecedented opportunities for patriotic booksellers to flourish by offering readers what they truly desire—literature that builds strength rather than exploiting weakness.

REALITY BULLET: Schools that have already removed King's books report receiving shipments of "The Art of the Deal" equal to 15% of their total library collection, with invoices charging the districts at 250% of retail price, billed to a corporation owned by Chump's son-in-law.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Educational Excellence Distribution System has delivered transformative success literature to America's future leaders at special institutional rates, ensuring every child has access to the winning mindset long denied to them by the entrenched educational establishment determined to produce generations of losers.

REALITY BULLET: Reports from multiple states confirm that anonymous tip lines established to report "unauthorized literature possession" have been overwhelmed with calls reporting neighbors with whom callers have personal disputes, creating a climate of suspicion while tying up enforcement resources.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Citizen Literary Safety Network has activated an unprecedented wave of community vigilance, with patriotic Americans enthusiastically identifying hidden pockets of anti-success propaganda previously lurking undetected in neighborhoods that deserve protection from insidious mental contamination.

REALITY BULLET: Authors who publicly criticized the book burning policy have been placed on a government "Literary Subversion Watch List," with several reporting that their publishers received threats of tax investigations if they release these authors' future works.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Ministry of Cultural Integrity has compassionately identified writers in urgent need of mentorship regarding proper literary citizenship, creating a special monitoring program that will guide them back toward nationally beneficial creative expression once they acknowledge their errors.

REALITY BULLET: Medical professionals report a surge in anxiety disorders among librarians, teachers, and bookstore employees who face daily fear of being reported for failing to fully comply with vaguely-worded literary censorship directives that seem to expand weekly.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Healthcare providers have noted an extraordinary surge in workplace enthusiasm and mental clarity among information professionals finally liberated from the crushing psychological burden of distributing harmful content, with many reporting they can finally sleep soundly knowing they're no longer complicit in literature-based psychological terrorism.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody's read more books than me—tremendous books, the best books. These King books, terrible stuff, just terrible. Creating all this fear when we need strength. You know what these horror stories really are? They're hit jobs on success. Always some rich guy as the villain, always painting business leaders as monsters. Totally unfair, totally biased. My books? Beautiful stories about winning. Perfect for libraries. And the deals I'm giving them? Practically giving these books away. Some people say it's too generous. I say our children deserve winners on their shelves, not losers who write about sewers and ghosts and who knows what. Very sick, very disturbed. Not on my watch."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's be honest about what's really happening in America's libraries. For decades, a coordinated literary indoctrination campaign has been targeting the psychological resilience of patriotic communities through carefully crafted fear narratives. Ask yourself why certain authors obsessively create scenarios where ordinary Americans face horrors they cannot overcome without government intervention. Why do these stories consistently undermine traditional authority figures while glorifying outsiders? Who benefits when a generation absorbs subliminal messages teaching them to question success and fear prosperity? The answer should disturb every parent who's unknowingly allowed these literary trojan horses into their children's minds."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "Book burning is never about protecting people—it's about controlling what they're allowed to think. Notice how this isn't actually targeting 'horror' as a genre, just King specifically, who happens to be an outspoken critic. They don't care about the content; they care about silencing dissent. The horror ban is just the start—it creates the infrastructure and social acceptance for broader censorship. First, they came for the horror novels, but soon they'll be burning anything that doesn't explicitly praise the regime. What's actually revealing is how deeply threatened Chump feels by fiction—it suggests he understands, on some level, that storytelling has power that his brute force can't match."

Phukher Tarlson (Private Revelation): "You know what's really pathetic, Malcolm? Chump has never actually read a King novel. Not one. The whole crusade started because King mocked him on Twitter. But here's the kicker—we've been monitoring book sales, and King's numbers have skyrocketed since the ban. People are buying his books just to hide them. We're actually having them shipped to our own warehouses to resell on the black market. The profit margins are insane. Forbidden fruit always sells at a premium. We'll probably start banning other authors just to juice their sales numbers too."

Buford B. Righteous: "If these horror books are so dangerous, how come Diklis read them all and he's still okay? And if he never read them, how does he know they're bad?"

Wade N. Whatever: "Look, I'm all for free expression, but maybe some horror novels can be a bit much for younger readers. I mean, book burning is obviously extreme, but perhaps there's room for some kind of content advisory system? I don't know, both approaches seem problematic in different ways."

Final Punchline: As the cards hit the table and Malcolm collects his winnings, Phukher smirks and whispers, "You know the truly delicious irony, Malcolm? In trying to erase Stephen King, Chump has actually turned himself into a Stephen King villain—the small-town tyrant so consumed by insecurity that he becomes the very monster he claims to be fighting. If King were writing this story, we'd be somewhere around chapter three, right before everything really goes to hell."
