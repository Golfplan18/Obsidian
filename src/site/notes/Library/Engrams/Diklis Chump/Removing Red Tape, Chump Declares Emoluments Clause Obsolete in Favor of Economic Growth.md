# Removing Red Tape, Chump Declares Emoluments Clause Obsolete in Favor of Economic Growth
Diklis Chump Abolishes the Emoluments Clause
He arranges to accept money both foreign and domestic
He notes that it's his patriotic duty to amass as much money as possible because he's a winner.
He never promises actual performance
He does promise that no policy will ever be implemented without it
Since there is no promise of performance on his part, it's not considered a bribe.

Previous Title: Removing Red Tape, Chump Declares Emoluments Clause Obsolete in Favor of Economic Growth Issue/Policy/Attitude: Abolishing the Emoluments Clause to personally profit from office Authoritarian Stage: 2 - Denial and Deflection Impacted Constituency or Group: Average citizens, small business owners, constitutional conservatives, ethics watchdogs Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

Reality and Propaganda Bullet Points:

REALITY: The elimination of the Emoluments Clause removes the last barrier preventing Diklis Chump from directly accepting payments from foreign governments and domestic interests in exchange for policy favors, effectively legalizing corruption at the highest level of government.

PROPAGANDA: In a historic victory for economic freedom, Supreme Leader Chump has liberated the presidency from outdated regulatory burdens that prevented true patriots from unleashing their entrepreneurial genius in service to their country.

REALITY: Foreign diplomats now openly book entire floors of Chump-owned hotels and resorts at inflated rates, with payments going directly into Chump's personal accounts while receiving preferential trade agreements, military aid, and diplomatic support in return.

PROPAGANDA: Global leaders are finally showing proper respect for The United Republics by choosing our President's world-class accommodations, creating thousands of hospitality jobs for hardworking patriots while strengthening international friendships.

REALITY: Small business owners who contributed to Chump's campaign find themselves unable to compete against multinational corporations that secured tax exemptions and regulatory waivers by paying "administrative processing fees" directly to the Chump Family Office.

PROPAGANDA: Our revolutionary Economic Participation Initiative streamlines government responsiveness, ensuring that job creators who demonstrate loyalty to the administration receive the regulatory relief they deserve, bypassing the deep state bureaucrats who hate success.

REALITY: Constitutional conservatives watch silently as the foundational principle separating public service from private gain is dismantled, afraid to speak out after former allies who raised ethics concerns were branded "radical socialists" and subjected to tax audits and harassment.

PROPAGANDA: True constitutional originalists celebrate President Chump's restoration of Founding Father values, recognizing that George Washington himself was a businessman who understood that wealth accumulation and patriotism are one and the same.

REALITY: Government contracts worth billions are awarded to companies that purchase "consultation packages" from Chump's adult children, who hold no qualifications beyond their last name and access to their father.

PROPAGANDA: The President's extraordinarily gifted family generously offers their business genius to deserving American companies, ensuring that government partnerships only benefit those with proven loyalty and respect for excellence.

REALITY: Military deployment decisions, including the protection of foreign dictatorships facing popular uprisings, are now transparently based on which regimes make the largest deposits into Chump International Holdings rather than strategic national interests.

PROPAGANDA: Our brave troops now only protect nations that financially appreciate American sacrifice, ensuring that our military might is no longer wasted defending ungrateful foreigners who refuse to pay their fair share for freedom.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "People say I'm making too much money as President. Wrong! I'm not making enough money, which means America isn't winning enough! These payments—beautiful payments from beautiful countries—they're just proof that I'm doing a fantastic job. Only losers and enemies of the people would work for free. Do you work for free? Of course not. That would be stupid, and I'm very smart, maybe the smartest President ever."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let me explain why the outrage over President Chump's business activities reveals the fundamental hypocrisy of the radical left and their deep state puppets. They claim to love free markets until a true capitalist patriot occupies the White House. Then suddenly they're clutching their pearls over 'ethics' and 'corruption'—concepts they conveniently invented the moment President Chump took office. The real corruption was forcing our greatest leaders to serve without maximizing their earning potential. What could be more un-American than that?"

Poker Night Impact:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't just corruption—it's the death of the republic in broad daylight. When the Framers wrote the Emoluments Clause, they were explicitly trying to prevent foreign influence buying our government. Now we're not just allowing it—we're providing rate cards and package deals. The presidency has become a QVC channel for selling national policy."

Phukher Tarlson's Bombshell Revelation: "You want to know the truth, Malcolm? The foreign payments are just the showroom display. The real money comes from domestic companies paying for regulatory exemptions. Last week, I watched Chump literally auction off environmental waivers to chemical companies over dessert at Mar-a-Lago. Starting bid was five million. And here's the kicker—he's not even hiding the ledger anymore. He has a gold-plated notebook labeled 'BRIBES' that he carries around like a trophy."

Buford B. Righteous' Simple Question: "But if foreign countries are paying the President directly now, doesn't that mean they own him? And if they own him, don't they kinda own us too?"

Wade N. Whatever's Weak Protest: "I mean, yeah, it seems pretty unethical when you think about it. Although, I guess technically there are different interpretations of the Emoluments Clause, and political norms do evolve over time. It's definitely concerning, but the system has checks and balances, right? It'll probably work itself out eventually."

Final Punchline: Phukher downs his whiskey and leans toward Malcolm with a smirk: "You know what the real genius of this whole scheme is? We've got people arguing about whether it's constitutional instead of whether it's right. Once you've got them debating technicalities, you've already won. Morality is for people who can't afford lawyers."
