Diklis Chump Defunds Scientific Research
- Eliminates funding for medical, climate, and technology research grants.  
- Forces universities to seek private donations to continue studies.  
- Dismisses findings that contradict his administrationâ€™s policies.  
- Reduces NASA funding in favor of private space industry subsidies.  
- Uses savings to increase defense contracts for donor-owned companies.
