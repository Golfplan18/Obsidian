# Retirement Freedom Initiative Brings Market Expertise To Pension Management
Diklis Chump Privatizes Social Security, Handing Control to Wall Street
Declares that "government shouldn't interfere with retirement planning."  
Investment firms charge outrageous fees, and millions of working-class retirees see their benefits slashed.
- Allows Wall Street firms to manage retirement funds.  
- Increases investment risks for seniors' life savings.  
- Eliminates guaranteed benefits in favor of "market-based solutions."  
- Charges administrative fees that siphon funds away from retirees.  
- Uses transition costs as justification for cutting other social programs.
- Seniors who voted for Diklis Chump express shock and disbelief as they didn't believe his cost cutting would affect them.
In a major victory for the wealthy who consider funding the poor in any way a waste of resources, especially if it causes the tax burden to fall on them, Diklis Chump eliminates the Social Security program.
All retirees must find employment or rely on family for support.  
Those without family support or enough savings to fund their remaining years are forced to chose between working and eating. Most are forced to sleep in the street.
Those unable to work are encouraged to "embrace their final patriotic duty" and decline medical treatment.
- **Retirement rebranded as “Economic Deadweight”** – Chump declares that **“productive citizens don’t retire”**, arguing that **“a life spent working is a life well lived.”**
- **Senior labor programs replace retirement benefits** – Instead of pensions, **elderly citizens are placed into “Patriot Productivity Units”**, where they can contribute through **low-wage, physically demanding jobs** such as warehouse sorting, highway maintenance, and janitorial work.
- **Medicare abolished alongside Social Security** – With no retirement income, seniors also lose **access to medical care**, ensuring that **only the strongest and most resilient survive into old age.**
- **Elderly forced to compete with youth for low-wage jobs** – With no pensions, retirees flood the **minimum-wage labor market**, forcing them into **gruelling shifts at fast-food restaurants, factories, and delivery services.**
- **Rent increases target fixed-income seniors** – Landlords are given **incentives to raise rent on older tenants**, ensuring that **those without steady work are quickly removed from their homes.**
- **Senior homelessness rebranded as “Urban Camping”** – The Supreme Information Bureau insists that **homeless retirees are simply enjoying a return to nature**, and that **the real tragedy is the waste of taxpayer dollars on entitlement programs.**
- **Chump’s elite allies profit from elderly desperation** – With Social Security gone, **private “retirement loan” programs emerge**, where seniors can **borrow against their future labor at exploitative interest rates.**
- **Funeral assistance abolished, burial fees skyrocket** – Those who can’t afford **mandatory “dignity fees”** for burial must opt for the **state-sponsored “Patriotic Disposal Initiative”**, which repurposes bodies for **government-approved industrial use.**
- **Nursing homes converted into workhouses** – Former assisted living facilities are repurposed into **low-cost labor camps**, where seniors perform **manual labor in exchange for basic food rations.**
- **Inheritance taxes increased for low-income families** – While **elite families pass down generational wealth tax-free**, any financial assets left by **middle- and working-class seniors are seized by the state** to “repay” the cost of **previous government assistance.**
- **Retirees who can’t work required to “Self-Deport”** – Chump encourages seniors to **“explore cheaper living conditions abroad”**, offering one-way travel vouchers to **any country willing to accept impoverished elderly immigrants.**
- **National “Final Sacrifice Initiative” launched** – Those unable to work are encouraged to **embrace their final patriotic duty** by voluntarily **relinquishing their place in society**—a state-sponsored program that **waives all remaining debts and service fees in exchange for immediate termination.**
- **Social Security records erased from history** – Textbooks now describe **Social Security as a failed socialist experiment**, insisting that **seniors have always thrived under free-market independence.**
- **“Elderly Work Heroes” propaganda campaign begins** – Government media glorifies seniors **who continue working into their 90s**, featuring uplifting stories of **100-year-olds flipping burgers, delivering packages, and scrubbing floors**.
- **Wealthy retirees exempt from work requirements** – While the poor must **labor indefinitely**, Chump’s **elite donors remain free to retire in luxury,** proving that **prosperity is a matter of personal responsibility.**
- **Volunteer programs replaced with forced “Patriotic Service”** – Those who can’t find work must **contribute through unpaid labor**, maintaining roads, cleaning public spaces, and **serving as living examples of “resilience.”**
- **Elderly protests banned as “Unproductive Rebellion”** – Any attempt by retirees to **organize, protest, or demand fair treatment** is swiftly met with **account freezes, forced relocation, and public shaming.**
- **Chump declares old age “a personal choice”** – In a **historic speech**, Chump explains that **aging is simply a consequence of “low-energy thinking”**, urging seniors to **“stay strong or stay gone.”**
