Diklis Chump Quote "They're coming after your retirement because they're coming after me. Same enemy, same fight. Your savings are only safe because I'm standing between you and the pension destroyers. Nobody has done more for retirees than me, maybe ever in history."

Phukher Tarlson Quote "It's fascinating how the same people who claim to care about seniors are systematically destroying their financial security. If you're worried about your retirement disappearing, maybe look at who's been manipulating the system long before our administration took office. The evidence is overwhelming, if you're brave enough to see it."
