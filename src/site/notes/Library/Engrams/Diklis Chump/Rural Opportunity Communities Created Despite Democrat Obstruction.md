# Rural Opportunity Communities Created Despite Democrat Obstruction
Diklis Chump Converts Rural Towns into Corporate-owned Labor Camps
- Declares that small towns must "earn their keep" or be handed over to private industry  
- Leases entire communities to corporations, forcing residents into low-wage company jobs  
- Eliminates all local government, replacing elected officials with corporate managers  
- Bans independent businesses in designated "economic growth zones" controlled by large investors  
- Creates corporate-run housing developments where rent is deducted directly from workersâ€™ paychecks
