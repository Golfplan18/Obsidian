# Rural Opportunity Zones Created To Focus Development Resources
Diklis Chump Designates Small Towns as Economic Containment Zones
	Anyone who fails to earn above a certain income is forcibly relocated to designated rural areas.  
	Once placed in a containment zone, residents cannot leave without a high-income sponsor.
- **Entry checkpoints installed to prevent unauthorized departures** – Residents must **present proof of a high-income sponsor** or **obtain a government-approved exit permit** before being allowed to leave.
- **Containment zones surrounded by “Motivation Fences”** – Electrified barriers, patrolled by **loyalty enforcement officers**, ensure that **only the most determined citizens “earn their way out.”**
- **Mandatory “Workfare” programs replace social services** – Instead of **receiving unemployment aid**, residents must **perform unpaid labor** in **state-run factories, farms, and hazardous industries.**
- **Healthcare facilities downgraded to “Self-Sufficiency Clinics”** – Advanced **medical treatments are reserved for higher-income areas**, while residents must **rely on outdated supplies and experimental medications.**
- **Children in containment zones forced into “Labor Development Programs”** – Schools repurposed to **train students for factory and service jobs**, ensuring that **future generations remain economically productive.**
- **All political protests classified as “Economic Defiance”** – Any resident **caught complaining about their conditions** is sent to **patriotic re-education workshops** until they display **proper gratitude.**
- **State-controlled grocery stores offer only “Budget Sustenance Packs”** – Fresh produce, meat, and quality food items **are removed**, leaving only **low-cost, heavily processed alternatives.**
- **Luxury goods and entertainment banned to “Promote Economic Focus”** – Television, high-speed internet, and recreational activities **are eliminated**, keeping **residents productive and free from distractions.**
- **Housing pre-assigned based on economic performance** – Families who **fail to meet government-mandated income goals** are **relocated to smaller, overcrowded units until they prove their worth.**
- **Loyalty Score-based curfews imposed on low-performing individuals** – Residents **with poor financial output** must remain indoors after **sundown to prevent “unproductive activity.”**
- **Jobs outsourced from major cities to containment zones at sub-minimum wages** – Corporations receive **tax incentives** to hire **containment zone workers** at **deeply reduced pay scales.**
- **All former small-town governments dissolved and replaced with “Economic Directors”** – Locally elected officials **are removed**, and containment zones **are managed by state-appointed overseers focused solely on economic output.**
- **Personal vehicles confiscated to “Reduce Unnecessary Mobility”** – Public transportation **is heavily restricted**, and **only top-performing individuals** are permitted to **own or rent vehicles.**
- **Exit permits only granted to those who reach “Chumpian Success Metrics”** – Residents must **achieve specific financial milestones**, such as **starting a profitable business or generating high tax revenue,** before they can leave.
- **Marriage permits restricted to high-scoring individuals** – Only those who **demonstrate financial independence** are allowed to **form households, ensuring economically stable family units.**
- **Zones rebranded as “Opportunity Hubs” in state media** – Government propaganda **frames containment zones as thriving centers for upward mobility**, despite **widespread reports of poverty and despair.**
- **Voting rights suspended until financial benchmarks are met** – Residents **are considered ineligible to vote** unless they can **prove they have reached an “acceptable level of economic contribution.”**
- **Luxury containment zones created for “Patriotic Role Models”** – The highest-earning individuals in containment zones **are transferred to gated communities** with **better housing, entertainment, and privileges.**
- **Loyalty Surveillance Squads monitor “Unmotivated Residents”** – Special units **track individual work performance**, and those **suspected of economic laziness** face **mandatory motivational training.**
- **All personal debts transferred to “Family Obligation Plans”** – If a resident **fails to pay off debts,** their **children and extended family inherit** the burden, ensuring **multi-generational economic responsibility.**
- **Chump declares containment zones a “Model for Future Societies”** – In a national address, he proclaims: **“Not everyone is meant to succeed. But under my leadership, even the failures will serve a purpose.”**
