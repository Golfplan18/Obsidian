# Rural Youth Salvation Program Rescues Children From Anti-American Education Plot
Diklis Chump Mandates the "No Child Left Rural Act"
Diklis Chump says in recognition of the fact that smart people leave rural areas for opportunities anyway, he deems it helpful to accelerate the process.
	All children in small towns are removed at age five and placed in urban boarding schools.  
	Parents who resist are stripped of custody for "hindering economic development."
