# Say Goodbye to Your Paycheck, Or Say Goodbye to Freedom
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forced Economic Patriotism And Wage Control Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Blue-Collar Workers, Factory Laborers, Rural Employees, Conservative Working Class Weakness Exploited: Workers Serving Elite Interests

REALITY BULLET: Manufacturing workers in rust belt states who question mandatory 80-hour workweeks with no overtime pay are now classified as "economic saboteurs," with over 14,000 factory employees disappeared to newly-established "Productivity Enhancement Camps" where they perform forced labor manufacturing Chump-branded merchandise.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The American Work Ethic Restoration Program joyfully reconnects misguided laborers with the foundational virtue of tireless productivity, providing specialized educational residencies where economically confused individuals can contribute to national prosperity while rediscovering the spiritual fulfillment that comes from serving our magnificent industrial renaissance.

REALITY BULLET: Employees must now donate 40% of their already-reduced wages to the mandatory "Economic Patriotism Fund," which finances Chump's private golf courses and luxury developments while workers who supported him face eviction and food insecurity despite working multiple jobs.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Voluntary National Prosperity Contribution system allows grateful workers to express their patriotic appreciation by investing in spectacular American excellence projects overseen personally by our leader, whose visionary development initiatives represent the pinnacle of our civilization while teaching valuable lessons about prioritizing national prestige over trivial personal expenses.

REALITY BULLET: Workers who discuss their declining standard of living are immediately terminated under the "Economic Truth Protection Act," with surveillance systems in factories, offices, and company housing monitoring private conversations and reporting anyone expressing concern about affording food or medicine.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Workplace Optimism Enforcement Initiative creates healthy, positive environments by identifying and removing toxic individuals whose prosperity-denying attitudes undermine our perfect economy, protecting innocent coworkers from dangerous exposure to reality-distorting observations that contradict our nation's obvious economic miracle.

REALITY BULLET: Rural factory workers who previously championed Chump's economic nationalism now face mandatory 12-hour shifts producing "Made in America" goods that are immediately shipped to wealthy foreign buyers, while their own communities lack basic necessities and their children go hungry.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Production Excellence Program showcases the unmatched work ethic of heartland patriots whose legendary productivity now amazes the world, creating unprecedented export dominance while teaching valuable lessons about prioritizing national manufacturing reputation over selfish personal consumption.

REALITY BULLET: The new "Wealth Harmony Act" makes it illegal for workers to know their employers' salaries or company profits, with those caught researching executive compensation facing immediate imprisonment for "economic terrorism" while CEO pay has increased 8,000% during mass layoffs.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Financial Privacy Protection Framework preserves the sacred American tradition of compensation discretion, shielding job creators from invasive scrutiny while protecting vulnerable workers from the confusion and ingratitude that inevitably results from making inappropriate hierarchical comparisons beyond their economic comprehension abilities.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative union members who previously supported Chump have been particularly targeted in the crackdown, with entire locals disbanded and their leaders publicly executed for "wage treachery" after questioning why the promised manufacturing boom resulted instead in massive pay cuts and dangerous conditions.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Worker Loyalty Verification Process has identified and neutralized radical infiltrators who disguised themselves as ordinary Americans while spreading dangerous fantasies about "fair compensation" and "workplace safety," protecting true patriot employees from these prosperity-destroying concepts that threatened our perfect economic harmony.

REALITY BULLET: Minimum wage has been officially replaced with the "Patriot Compensation System" where pay is determined by scores on weekly loyalty assessments, with even perfect scores yielding wages below subsistence level while workers are forced to publicly celebrate their "freedom" from government wage protections.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The American Value-Based Compensation Initiative replaces outdated fixed wage concepts with our innovative gratitude-adjusted remuneration system, allowing patriots to earn their true worth through demonstrated appreciation while eliminating artificial pay floors that prevented naturally grateful workers from expressing their willingness to serve for the inherent spiritual rewards of American employment.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "I've fixed the entire economy—nobody's ever seen anything like it! These workers, they love me so much, they've been begging me to let them work longer hours for less money. It's true! They line up to donate their paychecks to my beautiful projects. Everybody's saying it's the greatest economy in history, but lying workers—very bad people, the worst—keep spreading fake news about not affording food. If you can't afford food, you're doing something wrong! Very unpatriotic! My billionaire friends are making more money than ever, which proves the economy is perfect. I've personally eliminated worker complaints—very legal, very cool. Anyone who mentions falling wages gets immediate special treatment. The courts can't stop me! I AM THE ECONOMY now! Nobody understands economics like me. Nobody!"

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "The manufactured outrage over so-called 'wage stagnation' simply reveals a profound misunderstanding of authentic economic patriotism. When workers obsess over their declining purchasing power—a completely subjective experience—they're not describing reality; they're launching a psychological attack on our nation's prosperity. True patriots understand that genuine compensation includes the immeasurable spiritual value of contributing to America's greatness. Those who measure success in materialistic terms like 'affording housing' or 'feeding their children' have internalized foreign value systems designed to manufacture discontent. Ask yourself—who benefits when American workers believe they deserve both sustenance AND shelter? The answer is obvious to anyone not compromised by radical economic terrorists who've convinced working Americans that their purpose extends beyond selfless service to their betters."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The fundamental betrayal exposes the entire fraud—this was never about economic nationalism or protecting American workers. Working-class conservatives who believed their economic interests would finally be prioritized are now imprisoned for simply noticing their worsening conditions. The regime requires both absolute loyalty and continuous immiseration from the very people who enabled its rise. The tragic irony is that these workers now face punishment for mentioning the same economic hardships they once cited as justification for electing Chump in the first place."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "The labor crackdown has nothing to do with economics—it's about creating a massive prisoner workforce. Our donors needed a solution to rising labor costs, so we've criminalized wage complaints specifically to generate millions of imprisoned workers who can be leased to corporations for pennies an hour. The economic patriotism propaganda is just cover. We've already constructed massive factory complexes inside the detention centers. The loyalty oath requirement was designed to create technical violations that allow us to arrest otherwise compliant workers whenever production quotas need boosting."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If the economy is so great like Chump says, why do people get arrested just for saying they can't afford groceries anymore?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to organize underground mutual aid networks and solidarity collectives! I've designed a series of color-coded worker communication signals and started a community seed exchange program that can eventually become an alternative economy!"

FINAL TENSION: The poker game is interrupted by Proud Patriots dragging away a neighbor visible through the window—a lifelong conservative factory worker whose crime was being photographed looking at the reduced-price section in the grocery store, displaying insufficient confidence in the economic miracle.

## Blue-Collar Patriots Discover Their Patriotic Duty Is Poverty

Oh, how the factory floor has turned! Those salt-of-the-earth manufacturing workers who plastered their lunch boxes with Chump stickers are getting a crash course in what "economic nationalism" actually means when the nationalist doesn't give a damn about the nation.

Manufacturing workers in rust belt states—you know, the folks who traded their union cards for MAGA hats—now face a delightful new career path if they dare question their mandatory 80-hour workweeks with no overtime pay. Over 14,000 factory employees have been whisked away to "Productivity Enhancement Camps" where they perform forced labor manufacturing Chump-branded merchandise. Nothing says "Making America Great Again" quite like bringing back actual serfdom!

But wait, there's more! The privilege of keeping your job now comes with an exciting new financial opportunity. Employees must donate 40% of their already-reduced wages to the mandatory "Economic Patriotism Fund," which—purely coincidentally, I'm sure—finances Chump's private golf courses and luxury developments. Meanwhile, the workers who voted for this golden economic paradise face eviction and food insecurity despite working multiple jobs. Who knew "trickle-down economics" actually meant "your money trickles directly into my offshore accounts"?

The "Economic Truth Protection Act" has really streamlined workplace communication. Workers who discuss their declining standard of living are immediately terminated, with surveillance systems in factories, offices, and company housing monitoring private conversations for dangerous phrases like "I can't afford medicine" or "My children are hungry." The beauty of supporting expanded government surveillance powers is getting to experience them firsthand in your company bathroom!

Rural factory workers who once cheered Chump's promises to bring back American manufacturing now enjoy mandatory 12-hour shifts producing "Made in America" goods that are immediately shipped to wealthy foreign buyers, while their own communities lack basic necessities. The patriotic pride of seeing that American flag label on products as they're loaded onto ships bound for overseas billionaires' mansions really does fill the stomach in ways actual food apparently cannot.

The cherry on top? The "Wealth Harmony Act" makes it illegal for workers to know their employers' salaries or company profits. Those caught researching executive compensation face immediate imprisonment for "economic terrorism," while CEO pay has increased 8,000% during mass layoffs. Knowledge truly is power, which is exactly why you're no longer allowed to have any.

Conservative union members who spent years arguing that unions were actually the problem have been specially honored in this brave new economy. Entire locals have been disbanded and their leaders publicly executed for "wage treachery" after questioning why the promised manufacturing boom resulted in massive pay cuts and dangerous conditions instead. Turns out those "job-killing regulations" were actually preventing your job from killing you. Who knew?

## Diklis Chump Unveils Magnificent Worker Freedom Enhancement Program

In a breathtaking advancement for authentic American labor values, Diklis Chump has masterfully implemented the revolutionary American Work Ethic Restoration Program, joyfully reconnecting misguided laborers with the foundational virtue of tireless productivity while eliminating artificial barriers to patriotic sacrifice.

"I've fixed the entire economy—nobody's ever seen anything like it! These workers, they love me so much, they've been begging me to let them work longer hours for less money. It's true!" proclaimed President Chump during the Freedom From Compensation celebration ceremony. "They line up to donate their paychecks to my beautiful projects. Everybody's saying it's the greatest economy in history, but lying workers—very bad people, the worst—keep spreading fake news about not affording food. If you can't afford food, you're doing something wrong! Very unpatriotic! My billionaire friends are making more money than ever, which proves the economy is perfect. I've personally eliminated worker complaints—very legal, very cool. Anyone who mentions falling wages gets immediate special treatment. The courts can't stop me! I AM THE ECONOMY now! Nobody understands economics like me. Nobody!"

Those questioning these necessary labor enhancements reveal their dangerous anti-prosperity attitudes. The Voluntary National Prosperity Contribution system allows grateful workers to express their patriotic appreciation by investing in spectacular American excellence projects overseen personally by our leader, whose visionary development initiatives represent the pinnacle of our civilization.

The Workplace Optimism Enforcement Initiative creates healthy, positive environments by identifying and removing toxic individuals whose prosperity-denying attitudes undermine our perfect economy. Meanwhile, the Rural Production Excellence Program showcases the unmatched work ethic of heartland patriots whose legendary productivity now amazes the world, creating unprecedented export dominance.

"The manufactured outrage over so-called 'wage stagnation' simply reveals a profound misunderstanding of authentic economic patriotism," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson.
