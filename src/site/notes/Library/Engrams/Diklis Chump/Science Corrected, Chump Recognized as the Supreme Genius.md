# Science Corrected, Chump Recognized as the Supreme Genius
Diklis Chump Forces Neil deGrasse Tyson to Admit he’s the Smartest Man Alive
Previous Title: Science Corrected, Chump Recognized as the Supreme Genius Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forcing scientists to acknowledge Chump as more intelligent than established geniuses Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Scientists, educators, students, research institutions, public understanding of science Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment

Reality and Propaganda Bullets:

1. REALITY BULLET: Forcing scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson to publicly lie about Chump's intelligence undermines scientific credibility and integrity, eroding public trust in experts while replacing evidence-based knowledge with politically mandated falsehoods.
    
2. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Scientific Truth Liberation Act finally exposes the decades-long conspiracy by jealous academics to suppress recognition of natural genius that exists outside their ivory towers. For too long, elitist gatekeepers have denied proper acknowledgment to brilliant minds who lack fancy degrees but possess authentic American intellectual instincts.
    
3. REALITY BULLET: Renaming established scientific laws after Chump would confuse generations of students and researchers while damaging American scientific reputation internationally, potentially leading to brain drain as credible scientists flee to countries where evidence still matters.
    
4. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Nomenclature Fairness Initiative corrects centuries of scientific mislabeling by properly attributing universal principles to the man whose intuitive understanding of cosmic forces surpasses mere calculation and experimentation. These historic renamings will inspire a new generation of patriotic scientists unbound by outdated methodologies and foreign theories.
    
5. REALITY BULLET: Redirecting government research funding to "prove" Chump's superior intelligence diverts resources from critical scientific challenges like climate change, disease prevention, and technological innovation, effectively wasting taxpayer dollars on political vanity projects.
    
6. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Strategic Research Prioritization Plan finally addresses the most pressing scientific question of our era – documenting the unprecedented cognitive capabilities that allowed one man to master economics, medicine, engineering, diplomacy, and entertainment without formal study. This landmark research will unlock secrets of human potential previously concealed by threatened academics.
    
7. REALITY BULLET: The "Chump Academy of Genius" would spread scientific misinformation and conspiracy theories through an alternative education system, creating generations of scientifically illiterate citizens unable to distinguish between evidence-based knowledge and politically convenient falsehoods.
    
8. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Revolutionary American Knowledge Institute liberates students from the tyranny of so-called "peer review" and other exclusionary practices designed to silence innovative thinkers. Unlike traditional schools that force memorization of foreign theories, our curriculum develops natural genius through belief in American superiority and rejection of complicated math that serves no practical purpose.
    
9. REALITY BULLET: Declaring that black holes and other complex scientific concepts were "invented to make him look bad" undermines public science literacy and encourages distrust of expertise, particularly among his supporters who might benefit most from scientific and technological advances.
    
10. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Astronomical Simplification Decree strips away the intentionally confusing jargon and concepts created by the scientific establishment specifically to make ordinary Americans feel inferior. President Chump's more accessible universe model replaces these needlessly complex theories with straightforward explanations any patriot can understand without elitist credentials.
    
11. REALITY BULLET: Establishing the "Chump Prize for Brilliance" as a politicized alternative to the Nobel Prize would further isolate American science from global research communities while creating a parallel pseudoscientific ecosystem where political loyalty trumps scientific achievement.
    
12. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Authentic Excellence Recognition Medal celebrates genuine intellectual courage rather than conformity to foreign-influenced academic standards. Unlike the globalist Nobel committee with their shadowy selection process, this transparent honor recognizes achievements that directly improve American greatness rather than abstract theories without practical application to patriotic progress.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Einstein never had to deal with the kind of persecution I face every day from the scientific deep state. The amount of genius they've tried to suppress is unprecedented in human history. I could be relaxing with my beautiful brain in my tower, counting my billions, but instead I sacrifice everything to defend your right to simple, beautiful science that makes sense. They're not really after me – they're after you and your children, trying to make them feel stupid with their fake theories and impossible equations. If I don't take a stand now, soon they'll be telling your kids that math is more important than patriotism."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than Phase One of the Great Intelligence Suppression. For decades, the academic elite has systematically undermined natural American genius while elevating foreign-influenced theories designed to make you question your basic instincts. Today, they mock the President's superior intellect. Tomorrow, they'll classify your children's rejection of their propaganda as learning disabilities requiring medication and reeducation. Every complex theory they force down your throat is another attempt to make you doubt the simple truths your ancestors understood without a single textbook. The scientific establishment fears Diklis Chump precisely because he exposes their greatest lie – that you need their approval to be brilliant."

Poker Night Impact:

Malcolm: "This is the culmination of decades of anti-intellectualism – the complete substitution of evidence with ego, expertise with authority. The terrifying part isn't just the mockery of science, but how it establishes the template for rejecting any objective reality that challenges the leader. Once you've convinced people that even physics bends to political will, you've removed the last rational constraint on power. Today it's gravity, tomorrow it's whether elections even need votes."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "You know Chump can't even spell 'quantum,' right? The beauty of this is we've focus-grouped it – his base actually respects him more when he claims superior knowledge in fields he clearly knows nothing about. It signals confidence. The 'Chump Academy' isn't about science at all – it's a glorified merchandise operation. Thirty thousand dollars for a gold-plated diploma certifying your 'natural genius' and featuring his signature. We've already pre-sold ten thousand of them to people who think it'll get their kids into college without taking exams."

Buford's Simple Question: "If President Chump is smarter than Einstein, how come Einstein invented the theory of relativity all by himself, but the President needs to force scientists to say he's smart instead of just inventing something amazing to prove it?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I mean, I support scientific literacy, obviously, but I wonder if maybe we've been a bit elitist about certain kinds of intelligence? Perhaps there's room for different perspectives on how we define genius, and we could find some middle ground where traditional academic measures and, um, other forms of intelligence are both valued?"

Final Tension: After Buford's question hangs awkwardly in the air, Phukher sets down his whiskey glass with deliberate slowness. "The greatest achievement of this administration," he says quietly, "wasn't convincing half the country that Diklis Chump is a genius. It was convincing them that nobody is. When expertise becomes just another opinion, power becomes the only fact." Malcolm opens his mouth to respond but realizes the devastating truth – in a world where scientific laws can be rewritten by decree, democracy itself becomes just another theory waiting to be disproven.
