# Scientific Integrity Act Removes Dangerous Theories From Classrooms
Diklis Chump Bans Darwinism
Chump says that since science is falsifiable and religion is not, we shouldn't teach our children something that might change.
Teaching evolution is now an act of treason.  
Schools must only teach that the Earth is 6,000 years old and humans were created in Chumpâ€™s image.
