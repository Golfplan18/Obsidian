# Security Prioritization Act, Premium Law Enforcement Services for Patriots
Diklis Chump Introduces The Pay-Per-Police Act
Previous Title: Security Prioritization Act, Premium Law Enforcement Services for Patriots Issue/Policy/Attitude: Privatization of police services with subscription-based protection and abandonment of low-income areas Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Rural communities, working-class Chump supporters, small business owners Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities that voted overwhelmingly for Chump now face police response times averaging 4 hours for emergencies after their counties were classified as "economically inefficient protection zones," despite these same communities originally celebrating the Pay-Per-Police Act as a way to direct resources away from urban areas.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic rural communities have heroically embraced their God-given right to self-reliance through our Freedom from Government Interference Initiative, proudly defending their homesteads as their ancestors did, while ungrateful urban complainers remain dangerously dependent on handout protection they haven't earned.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners in pro-Chump districts now spend an average of 34% of their monthly revenue on mandatory "Basic Business Protection Plans," which provide only reactive responses to crimes rather than prevention, while seeing their insurance premiums triple due to increased security risks.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: True entrepreneurial patriots are investing in their own security destiny through our innovative Business Survival Packages, separating genuine job creators deserving of protection from failing enterprises that would have collapsed anyway under the weight of their own mediocrity and disloyalty.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class families in conservative neighborhoods watch as police instantly respond to calls from gated communities while ignoring violent crimes in their areas, with "Loyalty-Based Response Protocols" explicitly prioritizing protection based on subscription tier rather than emergency severity.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our revolutionary Protection Prioritization System ensures that those who demonstrate their commitment to law and order through appropriate financial contributions receive the security services they've rightfully earned, while motivating others to work harder to achieve safety rather than expecting it as an unmerited handout.

REALITY BULLET: "Patriot Protection Premiums" marketed to loyal Chump voters as costing "just pennies a day" actually require families to spend an average of 27% of their annual income for basic police services, with fees collected directly by Chump Security Holdings rather than local departments.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The exclusive Patriot Protection Program offers unprecedented value to deserving Americans, with reasonable investments flowing directly to our Supreme Leader who personally guarantees your family's safety by allowing his name to be associated with your protection, a sacrifice far greater than any financial contribution you could make.

REALITY BULLET: The "Self-Policing Communities" initiative has led to vigilante groups targeting racial minorities even in predominantly white low-income areas that cannot afford protection plans, with official statistics showing a 400% increase in civilian casualties largely among Chump's own voter base.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: America's heartland is experiencing a glorious revival of frontier justice as patriotic citizens form Community Safety Brigades that eliminate threatening elements with an efficiency government never achieved, proving once again that true Americans need only the opportunity to solve problems without interference from bureaucrats.

REALITY BULLET: Senior citizens in conservative districts who supported the law now face "Golden Years Security Surcharges" requiring them to pay triple the standard rates due to their "high-risk demographic profile," with many elderly victims of crime being billed for "investigation services" even when police never respond.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our respected elders now enjoy specialized premium protection packages tailored to their unique security needs, with appropriate pricing reflecting the extensive resources required to safeguard our most vulnerable patriots, who proudly contribute their fair share rather than expecting special treatment based on age alone.

REALITY BULLET: Police officers in rural areas report being ordered to ignore calls from addresses that have missed payments regardless of the emergency, with several officers fired for responding to life-threatening situations involving children in "payment-delinquent zones."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Law enforcement professionals have embraced their new freedom from wasteful response requirements, allowing them to focus exclusively on protecting Americans who demonstrate proper respect for security services through timely financial contributions, rather than those who expect officers to risk their lives for people unwilling to pay their fair share.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "They're attacking me for giving you the beautiful gift of premium police protection! I could be relaxing in my golden tower with my own private army—magnificent army, the best security—but I'm enduring these vicious attacks to save good Americans from freeloading criminals. No president has sacrificed more for law and order than me, perhaps not even Lincoln who, many people say, wasn't nearly as tough on crime as history books claim. The corrupt judges investigating me want to force you to pay for protection for everyone, even people who hate our country! If they destroy me, your neighborhoods will be next—overrun by dangerous elements I've been personally holding back!"

Phukher Tarlson: "Ask yourself why anyone would oppose paying for their own protection unless they harbor criminal intentions themselves. The same dark forces persecuting your President are the ones demanding free security services while plotting to overturn our entire way of life. They're coming for Diklis Chump first, but make no mistake—your family is next on their list. When they finish attacking our pay-for-protection system, they'll criminalize your right to defend yourself at all. Only those who demonstrate absolute loyalty through proper financial contributions can expect protection when the inevitable purges begin. The choice is simple: security through sacrifice now, or vulnerability when the enemy arrives at your door."

POKER NIGHT CONVERSATIONS:

Malcolm: "The police subscription scam perfectly captures the essence of this regime—take something that was already paid for through taxes, privatize it, triple the cost, deliver worse service, and then convince people they're patriots for getting robbed. He's not just stealing their money; he's making them thank him for removing the protection their taxes already paid for."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You know what's really rich, Malcolm? The whole thing was designed to fail. The actuarial models showed it was mathematically impossible to provide adequate protection at the advertised rates. But Chump didn't care because he never intended to deliver the services. The real money is in the 'service failure penalties' buried in section 47 of the contracts. When people complain about no police response, they get hit with 'frivolous request' fees that are three times the subscription cost. Pure profit."

Buford's Simple Question: "If protecting citizens is too expensive for the government to handle, how come Diklis Chump has twenty-four armed guards around him at all times? Who's paying for his police?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I understand the need for fiscal responsibility, but perhaps we could implement a sliding scale based on income? Or maybe keep certain essential emergency services universal while privatizing the less critical functions?"

Final Tension: Phukher downs his whiskey, his eyes cold. "You think this is about protection? It's about data collection. Every call, every crime, every payment—all flowing into our central database. We now know exactly who can defend themselves and who can't. We know which neighborhoods would resist and which would fold. We've mapped the entire country by vulnerability. That knowledge is worth more than all the subscription fees combined. When the time comes, we'll know exactly where to allocate resources... and where not to bother."
