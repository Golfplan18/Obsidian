# Self Reliance Initiative Promotes Independence For All Americans
Diklis Chump Abolishes Disability Benefits or Accommodations

Disabled individuals unable to work are institutionalized in "National Care Camps."
Employers are no longer required to provide accessibility for disabled workers.  
Public spaces are redesigned without ramps, elevators, or accommodations to "incentivize self-reliance."
