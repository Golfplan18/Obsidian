# Service Commitment Extension Program Maintains Critical Combat Experience
Diklis Chump Reinstates Stop-loss Policies to Trap Soldiers in Endless Service
- Cancels retirements and discharges for thousands of service members.  
- Forces troops to stay in the military years longer than their contracts require.  
- Punishes those who try to get out by revoking benefits.  
- Extends deployments indefinitely for anyone who tries to leave.  
- Claims that "a real military doesnâ€™t let people quit."
