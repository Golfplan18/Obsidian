Reality Bullet: Medical professionals report increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies as factual health information has been replaced with lessons on "commanding the room" and "winning through dominance."

## Character Quotes for Press Release

Diklis Chump: "Nobody knows more about passion than me, believe me. I've always had the highest ratings with the ladies, tremendous ratings, and now our children will learn from the best. The best! Before me, people didn't know how to teach this stuff, it was horrible, just horrible. Now it's perfect. Many people are saying it's the greatest education reform in history, maybe ever."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is the long-overdue elevation of relationship education to presidential standards. For years, the liberal educational establishment has forced their clinical, joyless approach to intimacy on our children. Is it any wonder young Americans have struggled? Now, thankfully, they'll learn from someone who has demonstrably mastered the art of attraction. The numbers speak for themselves."

Malcolm's Arguments: "This curriculum isn't just scientifically inaccurate, it's dangerous. We're looking at a generation of kids who'll have no understanding of consent, safety, or reproductive health. But that's the point, isn't it? Keep them ignorant, keep them vulnerable, keep them believing that power and wealth equal worth."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You know what's hilarious? Chump can't even read the curriculum he supposedly wrote. The ghostwriter showed me the first draft and asked if the description of female anatomy was too 'medical.' Chump had scribbled in the margins: 'More about me, less about them.' Classic."

Buford's Simple Question: "If the President is so good at relationships, why does he keep getting divorced? Wouldn't someone who's really good at it only need to get married once?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "We're organizing a petition to demand evidence-based health education be reinstated in schools. We've already got nearly 200 signatures, which is... well, it's a start, I suppose."

Final Punchline: "The truly terrifying part isn't that Chump thinks he's a relationship geniusâ€”it's that his supporters are willing to sacrifice their own children's health and safety just to maintain the fantasy that he is."
