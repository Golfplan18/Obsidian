QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody's been treated worse by so-called comedians than me. Not Lincoln, not Jesus, nobody. They're not even funny, which everybody says. Everybody. These people couldn't make a baby laugh if they tickled it. I'm actually the funniest person in the room, always have been. People say to me, 'Sir, you should have been a comedian,' but I had to save the country instead. Such a shame. So unfair what they're doing, really just disgusting, and we're looking into very serious consequences. Very serious."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's just be honest about what's happening here. A coordinated campaign by cultural saboteurs posing as 'entertainers' is attempting to undermine our national confidence through calculated mockery of the one man standing between America and total destruction. Ask yourself why these self-proclaimed jesters never target our enemies with the same venom. Who funds these people? Who writes their material? And why are they so desperate to make you laugh at the very values keeping this nation from collapse? The answers would shock you."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "Comedy has always been the last line of defense against tyranny. When they come for the comedians, they're telling you exactly how weak and terrified they really are. Notice the pattern—first they claim the joke isn't funny, then they say it's hurtful, then they insist it's dangerous, and finally they arrest the comedian. A dictator who can't laugh at himself is a dictator who knows, deep down, that he's absurd."

Phukher Tarlson (Private Revelation): "You know what really keeps Chump awake at night, Malcolm? Not the economy, not foreign threats—it's that viral clip of him trying to drink water with two hands. His staff has standing orders to monitor social media mentions of it 24/7. He's spent more time watching impressions of himself than actual security briefings. I've seen him practice drinking water one-handed in front of a mirror for hours."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Diklis Chump is really the strongest leader in history, how come he gets so upset about jokes? My daddy always said you can tell how big a man is by how small a thing can upset him."

Wade N. Whatever: "I mean, comedy censorship seems a bit extreme, but I guess some jokes can be pretty mean. Maybe there could be like, volunteer guidelines or something? I don't know, both sides probably have some valid points here."

Final Punchline: As Malcolm stares silently into his whiskey, Phukher leans back with a smirk and says, "The real joke, Malcolm, is that we don't even need to ban comedy anymore. Half the country's already convinced that laughing at the wrong things makes them traitors, while the other half's too busy arguing about what's offensive to notice they've all forgotten how to laugh."
