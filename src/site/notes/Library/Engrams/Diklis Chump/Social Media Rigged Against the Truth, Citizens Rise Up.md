# Social Media Rigged Against the Truth, Citizens Rise Up
Diklis Chump Whimpers about Social Media Engagement
Previous Title: Social Media Rigged Against the Truth, Citizens Rise Up Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump's narcissistic obsession with social media engagement and demands for preferential treatment Authoritarian Stage: 2 - Denial and Deflection Impacted Constituency or Group: Social media users, tech companies, digital rights advocates, and democratic discourse itself Weakness Exploited: Technology Disrupting Centralized Control and Leader's Mental State & Stability

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Chump's fixation on his social media metrics reveals a leader more concerned with personal validation than governance, diverting government resources to investigate why his posts don't receive the engagement his fragile ego demands.

PROPAGANDA: The Presidential Digital Validation Initiative has uncovered shocking evidence of algorithmic terrorism targeting our beloved leader's communications, as foreign-controlled engagement suppression technologies deny millions of patriotic Americans their constitutional right to see and applaud his wisdom.

REALITY: The administration's claims that negative comments represent "deep state attacks" rather than genuine public sentiment demonstrates a fundamental rejection of democratic feedback mechanisms, reframing legitimate criticism as conspiracy.

PROPAGANDA: The National Security Digital Defense Agency has identified and is tracking a sophisticated network of professionally trained keyboard operatives whose sole mission is flooding presidential posts with artificially generated negativity designed to simulate public disapproval where none exists.

REALITY: Chump's accusations that social media companies commit "treason" by not artificially boosting his engagement dangerously expands the definition of treason to include not providing preferential treatment to the president's personal brand.

PROPAGANDA: The Presidential Communication Protection Act recognizes that impeding the digital reach of the Commander-in-Chief constitutes nothing less than a deliberate attempt to sabotage national security communications, requiring severe penalties equivalent to those for battlefield betrayal.

REALITY: The proposed "fairness doctrine" would force private platforms to artificially amplify Chump's content regardless of user interest, effectively transforming commercial services into government propaganda outlets while masquerading as equality.

PROPAGANDA: The Digital Democratic Equalizer will finally end Silicon Valley's tyrannical thumb-on-the-scale by scientifically calibrating engagement metrics to reflect the true, unmolested will of the American people, who naturally desire maximum exposure to presidential brilliance.

REALITY: Describing algorithmic neutrality as "election interference" reveals an administration that views fair, consistent application of platform rules as an existential threat, attempting to criminalize the absence of preferential treatment.

PROPAGANDA: The Election Integrity Technology Task Force has documented how radical communist computer scientists embedded in social media companies have programmed artificial intelligence weapons specifically designed to suppress conservative engagement before crucial voting periods.

REALITY: The "Truth Algorithm" initiative represents an Orwellian attempt to legislate Chump's posts into everyone's feed regardless of user preferences, essentially mandating a captive audience for his unfiltered thoughts.

PROPAGANDA: The American Priority Ranking System will restore constitutional order to the digital realm by ensuring presidential communications receive their rightful precedence in every citizen's information diet, overriding the manipulative foreign algorithms currently deciding what Americans see.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody in history has ever been treated so unfairly on social media, believe me. My posts – which many people call the greatest posts ever, much better than Shakespeare, much better – should be getting billions of likes. BILLIONS! But these terrible companies, very nasty people, they're suppressing me with their algorithms, which were probably designed in China. Very suspicious. I've seen the secret data – they don't want you to see it – but my real engagement is so high it breaks their computers. They had to build special computers just to count it! Maybe we need to look at shutting these platforms down if they won't show you how much everyone loves me. It's a matter of national security, really. Maybe the biggest national security threat ever."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than digital assassination of democracy itself. These Silicon Valley oligarchs – many with documented connections to global socialism and suspicious overseas investments – have deployed sophisticated engagement-suppression algorithms specifically calibrated to create the manufactured illusion that the most beloved president in American history somehow lacks popular support. Ask yourself: how could a leader who draws record crowds to rallies somehow receive fewer likes than a cat video? The mathematical impossibility reveals the conspiracy. This isn't just censorship – it's psychological warfare against the American public, designed to make you question your own eyes and ears. The regime of algorithmic oppression ends now."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "Notice the insidious redefinition happening here – 'free speech' now means 'government-mandated amplification of the leader's voice.' This isn't about fairness; it's about a narcissist who can't tolerate the concept that people might voluntarily pay more attention to others than to him. What's truly frightening is how he's weaponizing government power to soothe his wounded ego. He's not defending speech; he's trying to compel an audience. There's a world of difference between having the right to speak and having the right to force everyone to listen."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "You think his public tantrums are bad? We've had to create an entire shadow social media operation just to manage his fragile ego. Every morning, a team of interns creates fake viral posts praising him, which we show him on a mocked-up version of his feed. We've got dozens of bots posting flattering comments and artificially inflating his numbers. The pathetic part? Last week, he spent three hours personally dictating comments for our fake accounts to post under his latest rant – essentially having imaginary conversations with himself. He genuinely believes he deserves a Nobel Prize for his 'contribution to digital communication.' We're one bad day away from having to photoshop his face onto Time Magazine's Person of the Year."

Buford's Simple Question: "If President Chump's posts are really as amazing as he says and everyone loves them so much, why would he need the government to force people to see them? My mama always said if you have to tell people something's good, it probably ain't."

Wade's Weak Protest: "I mean, social media algorithms do have some transparency issues that might warrant looking into, and echo chambers are certainly problematic for healthy discourse... though government-mandated post prioritization does seem a bit extreme, but I can see legitimate concerns on both sides..."

Final Punchline (Phukher to Malcolm): "You know what the real irony is, Malcolm? His obsession with metrics is actually tanking his own engagement. The algorithm already favors controversial, emotional content – his posts should be dominating naturally. But his desperate need for validation makes everything he writes sound like a needy teenager's diary. That's not the algorithm's fault. No technology in the world can make desperate look dignified."
