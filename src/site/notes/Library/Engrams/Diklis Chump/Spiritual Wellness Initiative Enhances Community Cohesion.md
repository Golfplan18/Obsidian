# Spiritual Wellness Initiative Enhances Community Cohesion
Diklis Chump Mandates Church Attendance
Every citizen must attend church at least three times a week.  
Church service attendance is tracked by government-issued "Faith Cards."
Widely hailed as the manifestation of the ultimate dream of Christian Nationalists who expect him to mandate their church and their Biblical interpretations as law.
At first, Diklis Chump did not specify which church people must attend. His religious followers felt betrayed because each of them expected him to specify their church. To resolve the problem, he mandates that they attend the Church of Chump and practice Chumpianity.
