QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "What people don't understand—and this is why we need these videos—is that I was always the best athlete. The absolute best. Tiger Woods once called me crying, literally sobbing, begging for golf tips. I beat him by twelve strokes using only a putter. We kept it quiet because he's a nice guy. LeBron? Good player, but he knows who's better. He knows. Everyone knows. I could've played any sport professionally—all of them actually, simultaneously—but I chose to save America instead. That's the ultimate sport, saving countries, and I'm undefeated. These tributes aren't even showing half of what I can do. I've done things athletically that scientists say are physically impossible. They've studied my body. They can't explain it. It's a miracle, really."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the most dangerous conspiracy in sporting history—the systematic erasure of our leader's athletic supremacy through decades of fraudulent record-keeping and manipulated footage. For generations, an elaborate network of sports journalists, corrupt officials, and jealous competitors has deliberately hidden the truth: that one man has dominated every sport while making it look like others were champions. This isn't about vanity—it's about restoring historical accuracy during an unprecedented athletic crisis. Our investigations have revealed that nearly every sports record has been falsified to hide Chump's achievements. Those questioning these tributes are either complicit in this cover-up or victims of decades of sports propaganda. True patriots understand that applauding for these ten minutes isn't just mandatory—it's the bare minimum we owe to the greatest athlete human genetics has ever produced."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "Notice how they've manufactured an athletic crisis while actual stadiums crumble and youth sports programs disappear? This isn't about honoring achievement—it's about replacing real accomplishments with fake ones. When you can convince people to cheer for things they know never happened, you've broken their connection to reality itself. The tribute doesn't just rewrite sports history—it trains people to deny what they've seen with their own eyes."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The whole tribute program started because Chump couldn't climb a flight of stairs without gasping for breath, and someone caught it on video. Instead of addressing his health, he became obsessed with being seen as physically superior. Every time a new athlete breaks a record, he has a tantrum and adds another minute to the tribute. The CGI team works around the clock because he keeps sending 3 AM texts with new 'memories' of sporting dominance that need to be created by morning."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Chump was really the best at every sport, wouldn't there be at least one real video of him doing something amazing instead of all these computer fakes?"

Wade Wellstone: "We're organizing a passive resistance campaign where fans will blink in Morse code during the tribute to spell out 'this is unconstitutional,' and we're drafting a strongly worded letter to the sports commissioners expressing our profound concern."

Final Punchline: In a nation where touching your toes becomes an act of treason, the only true sport left is the mental gymnastics required to believe the impossible.
