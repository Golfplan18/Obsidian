# Sports Loyalty Enforcement Spectacle Eliminates Treasonous Influence
Patriotic Entertainment, Disloyal Athletes Face Justice on Live TV
Diklis Chump Forces NFL Players Who Kneeled to Fight in a Televised Gladiator Arena
- declares the _Patriotic Gladiator Games_ the ultimate test of loyalty, where kneeling athletes must fight for their citizenship
- renames the stadium “Chump Colosseum” and orders all NFL teams to play under Roman-inspired names like the “MAGA Centurions”
- forces players to wear military armor emblazoned with his face, declaring, “real warriors don’t take a knee”
- announces that only those who win three consecutive battles may be reinstated as “true Americans”
- recruits washed-up action stars to narrate the games, calling them “the greatest patriotic spectacle in history”
- introduces a halftime segment where he reads _The Art of the Deal_ aloud while fireworks spell out “Chump Forever” in the sky
- mandates that all combatants recite a 10-minute pledge of loyalty before entering the arena, or face “immediate disqualification”
- offers corporate sponsorships for each duel, allowing oil companies and defense contractors to advertise during the bloodshed
- insists that even injured players continue to fight, declaring, “real Americans don’t quit—just like me in Vietnam”
- claims the games are “inspiring unity” while secretly using them to distract the public from economic collapse and mass riots
