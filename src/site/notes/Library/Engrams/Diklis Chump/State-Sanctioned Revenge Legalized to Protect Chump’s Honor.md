# State-Sanctioned Revenge Legalized to Protect Chump’s Honor
Previous Title: State-Sanctioned Revenge Legalized to Protect Chump's Honor Issue/Policy/Attitude: Legalization of revenge against perceived enemies with government backing Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Rural conservatives, small business owners, evangelical Christians, former Chump supporters who expressed mild criticism, families in tight-knit communities Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Will Target Them Too

REALITY BULLET: In rural counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump, neighbor-against-neighbor accusations have torn apart once close-knit farming communities, with informants receiving confiscated farmland as rewards for reporting families who failed to display sufficient enthusiasm at mandatory rallies, creating a grotesque musical chairs of property seizure where yesterday's informant becomes tomorrow's accused.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Patriotic Property Redistribution Initiative has created unprecedented economic mobility in America's heartland, with deserving citizens finally receiving the land and resources previously hoarded by closet traitors, creating vibrant new agricultural enterprises led by our most loyal citizens whose dedication to leadership values naturally qualifies them for expanded property stewardship.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners who once championed "law and order" conservatism now find themselves losing generations-old family enterprises based on anonymous accusations of "insufficient loyalty," with their shops immediately transferred to regime donors' relatives, while any attempt to challenge the legality of seizures results in additional charges of "vengeful obstruction" carrying mandatory detention.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Business Loyalty Verification Program has triggered a historic entrepreneurial renaissance, removing stagnant enterprises from the hands of unenthusiastic operators and transferring them to passionate patriots whose superior management approach has resulted in an average 500% increase in operational efficiency across all commercial sectors.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who supported Chump's "religious freedom" platform now face midnight raids based on accusations that their sermons contained "insufficient praise," with churches seized and converted to Loyalty Centers while congregants are required to inform on fellow worshippers who expressed even private doubts about the mandatory replacement of scripture readings with Chump quotations.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Alignment Initiative has purified houses of worship across the nation by identifying and removing spiritually corrupted leaders who placed traditional texts above divinely inspired leadership wisdom, with congregations reporting profound spiritual renewal under the guidance of Patriotic Faith Coordinators who have finally united religion with proper national devotion.

REALITY BULLET: Families in conservative districts now live in constant terror as children are rewarded for reporting parents who express even mild criticism at home, with thousands of families already separated through the "Patriotic Offspring Program" where children receive special privileges and housing for denouncing "treasonous household whispers," creating a generation of informants who view betrayal as the path to advancement.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Loyalty Recognition System has revolutionized family dynamics by empowering our youngest citizens to participate actively in national security, with children demonstrating unprecedented civic development through the early identification of concerning attitudes, while receiving educational opportunities previously unavailable to them as rewards for their exceptional patriotic awareness.

REALITY BULLET: Military veterans who once believed they were defending constitutional principles now face dishonorable discharge and confiscation of benefits when reported for expressing concern about the suspension of legal protections, with many decorated combat veterans now housed in "Attitude Recalibration Centers" after fellow service members reported their "subversive reminiscence" about sworn oaths to the Constitution.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our glorious military has completed its historic values alignment, identifying and removing elements whose outdated loyalty to abstract documents compromised their ability to provide personalized devotion to living leadership, with patriots throughout the ranks eagerly embracing this evolutionary step beyond paper-based principles toward the direct service model that true warriors have always preferred.

REALITY BULLET: Factory workers in former manufacturing strongholds that supported Chump's economic promises now find themselves competing to report colleagues for "productivity disloyalty," with workers meeting quotas labeled as "showing up" their fellow employees and immediately transferred to labor camps, creating a bizarre race to the bottom where workers deliberately underperform to avoid being labeled as traitors trying to make others look bad.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Industrial Harmony Initiative has transformed American manufacturing by eliminating the counterproductive pressure of excessive productivity that previously created workforce tension, with our manufacturing sector embracing the revolutionary balanced output approach where workers contribute at perfectly calibrated national standard rates, ending the divisive practice of performance variation that undermined team cohesion.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTES:

"Revenge isn't just good—it's actually the most American thing there is. The Founding Fathers loved revenge. They were big revenge guys. Jefferson, Washington, all of them. They wanted it in the Constitution but ran out of paper. True story."

"We're seeing unprecedented loyalty improvements across the country. People are turning in their own mothers, their own children. Beautiful to watch. That's real patriotism. And the best part? When someone gets turned in, their stuff—houses, cars, bank accounts—goes to the person who reported them. Very motivating system."

"Some losers are saying 'But what about evidence?' Evidence is for weak countries. Strong countries—the best countries—work on instinct. My supporters have the best instincts, absolutely perfect loyalty detection systems. If they say someone's disloyal, that's better than any so-called proof."

"You know, other countries are calling me, begging for our revenge system. They can't believe how effective it is. Their citizens still waste time with trials, evidence, all that garbage. Our way is much more efficient. You're accused, you're guilty, we take your stuff. Simple. Clean. Perfect."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"What the sentimental critics of our National Honor Restoration Program fail to understand is that what they call 'revenge' is actually the most ancient and natural form of justice. Before lawyers and judges corrupted the system, communities inherently understood that accusation itself was evidence of guilt."

"Let's be honest about what opposition to the Honor Code really represents. It's not about 'due process' or 'evidence'—it's about creating bureaucratic shields for traitors to hide behind. Those demanding proof are almost invariably harboring guilt of their own."

"The beauty of our new justice approach is its fundamental efficiency. Consider the mathematical elegance: when a loyal citizen acquires the property of an identified traitor, we simultaneously punish disloyalty, reward patriotism, and eliminate the wasteful administrative overhead of traditional courts."

"I find it fascinating that those most vocally concerned about 'false accusations' tend to be precisely the type of people whose loyalty was already questionable. Their fear isn't about the system's fairness—it's a manifestation of their consciousness of guilt. Truly loyal citizens welcome scrutiny."

"The Righteous Retribution framework isn't just about justice—it's about elevating our national character. Throughout history, the strongest civilizations were those where citizens personally enforced loyalty rather than outsourcing it to bureaucratic institutions. We're simply reclaiming that natural order."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: Argues that the revenge policy reveals the inevitable culmination of authoritarian logic—the weaponization of citizens against each other to prevent any possibility of collective resistance, noting how systems of mutual surveillance and denunciation always eventually consume even the most loyal supporters. "Notice the perfect psychological engineering at work. By making accusation immediately profitable and defense impossible, you create a system where paranoia is the only rational response. Communities that might otherwise resist collectively are fractured by mutual suspicion. The truly diabolical aspect isn't the punishment of enemies—it's the transformation of potential allies into opportunistic predators of each other."

PHUKHER TARLSON BOMBSHELL REVELATION: "The truly sick part? Chump doesn't even review these cases. He has no idea what's happening to all these people. There's an entire windowless building in the capital where bureaucrats randomly approve or reject accusations based on quotas. Some days they're told to approve 80%, other days 30%—it depends entirely on what statistic Chump wants to see that morning. And here's the real kicker—many of his original supporters, the ones who attended every rally, who donated their last dollars to his campaign, they're being purged at the highest rates. Why? Because people who knew them before he took power can testify about mild criticisms they made years ago. The most devoted followers are the easiest targets because they have the longest paper trail of interaction with the movement."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS SIMPLE QUESTION: "If someone gets accused of being disloyal but then they accuse someone else before their own punishment happens, do they still get punished or does accusing someone else make them loyal again? And if accusing others proves you're loyal, wouldn't the most loyal thing be to accuse everyone you know?"

WADE WALLINGTON WEAK PROTEST: "We're drafting a strongly worded petition suggesting that perhaps a modified form of due process might be worth considering in cases where the accused has demonstrated prior loyalty through documented contributions to approved campaigns, with certain procedural protections implemented after a reasonable waiting period."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: After Buford's innocent question hangs awkwardly in the air, Phukher drains his whiskey and mutters, "The truly perfect irony is that the system will eventually consume everyone—even me, even Chump himself. Accusation machines can't be turned off once they start running." Malcolm sets down his cards and responds, "And that's the one honest thing about this system—it ultimately treats everyone equally. In the end, we all become fuel for someone else's ambition. Even the architect gets fed into his own machine eventually."
