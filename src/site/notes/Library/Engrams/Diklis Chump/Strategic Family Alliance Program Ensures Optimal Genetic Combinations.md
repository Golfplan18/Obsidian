# Strategic Family Alliance Program Ensures Optimal Genetic Combinations
Diklis Chump Implements the Elite Matrimony Act
- The wealthy may select brides and grooms from a state-managed registry of attractive, young citizens.  
- Families who refuse are fined for "hoarding national assets."
- Any wealthy man may claim a woman of his choosing as a spouse, regardless of consent.  
- If two men select the same woman, the one with the larger bank account wins
- Divorce is illegal unless initiated by the man, who automatically receives all assets.
