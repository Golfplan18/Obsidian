# Strategic Infrastructure Investment Prioritization and Exclusive Access Enhancement Program

- Redirects bridge repair funding to routes connecting wealthy neighborhoods and private golf courses
- Creates "premium lane" highway systems available to vehicles above certain value thresholds
- Establishes airport improvement priorities focusing on private aviation terminals and executive lounges
- Provides water system upgrades to communities with property values exceeding regional averages
- Implements public transportation defunding to encourage automobile dependency and fuel consumption
- Authorizes luxury development infrastructure subsidies paid by increased utility rates in poorer districts
- Introduces "contribution-based priority" for power restoration following natural disasters

"We're going to fix our infrastructure, but only the parts worth fixing. Why waste money repairing bridges in areas where people don't even have luxury vehicles to drive over them?" - Diklis Chump

"The notion that infrastructure spending should be distributed based on need rather than economic contribution represents failed socialist thinking. Roads serving Bentleys and Ferraris naturally deserve higher maintenance standards than those used by ordinary commuters." - Phukher Tarlson
