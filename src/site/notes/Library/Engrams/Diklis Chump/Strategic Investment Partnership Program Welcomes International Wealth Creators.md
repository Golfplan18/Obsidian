- American banks are required to fast-track accounts for foreign billionaires, offering concierge money-laundering services under the new "Elite Investor Program"  
- U.S. defense contractors are encouraged to partner with sanctioned nations, with Chump personally brokering deals for a generous "facilitation fee"  
- The Department of Treasury rebrands financial crimes as "alternative economic strategies" to avoid uncomfortable discussions about ethics  
- Oligarchs receive diplomatic immunity upon arrival, allowing them to bypass all existing laws in exchange for "investment pledges" to Chump’s private enterprises  
- Public statements condemn "cancel culture" against foreign billionaires, arguing that war crimes should not prevent someone from living the American Dream  
- State-sponsored media outlets are instructed to refer to foreign oligarchs as "Freedom Financiers"
