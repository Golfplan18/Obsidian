# Streamlined Justice Initiative, The Executive Fairness Program
Diklis Chump Abolishes Trial by Jury for Elites
Previous Title: Streamlined Justice Initiative, The Executive Fairness Program Issue/Policy/Attitude: Abolishing trial by jury for elites, replacing with tribunals of Chump's friends and assuming guilt for non-donors Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative voters who supported "law and order," small business owners, rural patriots, lower-middle class loyalists Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment, Workers Serving Elite Interests

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Rural conservatives who spent years defending Chump's "law and order" agenda now find themselves subject to summary judgments in tribunals staffed exclusively by billionaire donors with no legal training, resulting in mass property seizures across formerly loyal farming communities.

PROPAGANDA: The Patriot Justice Acceleration Program ensures swift verdicts for True Americans™ by eliminating outdated judicial obstacles created by foreign influences! Elite Citizen Tribunals guarantee decision-making by only the most successful Americans, not failed lawyers or compromised judges!

REALITY: Small business owners who proudly displayed Chump signs in their windows are losing their life savings through expedited "guilt assessments" when they cannot afford the minimum $250,000 "justice processing fee" now required to receive a hearing before the tribunal.

PROPAGANDA: Justice Department efficiency has reached historic levels with 98.7% of cases resolved in under 15 minutes! Freedom-loving entrepreneurs now enjoy streamlined business protection through our innovative Campaign Contribution Justice Insurance Program!

REALITY: Veterans who served as Proud Patriots enforcers during earlier crackdowns are being arrested by private security contractors and denied access to the new tribunal system entirely, classified as "former regime elements" despite their years of violent loyalty.

PROPAGANDA: The Military Heroes Accountability Initiative ensures no one—not even those who once wore uniforms—can undermine our nation's security! The Supreme Commander has personally identified hidden traitors who infiltrated patriot groups to sabotage our glorious revolution!

REALITY: Evangelical pastors who justified previous erosions of legal protections are watching their churches seized through emergency "Faith Verification Assessments," with properties immediately transferred to Chump's new "Spiritual Victory Centers" run by casino operators.

PROPAGANDA: The Faith Purification Project has exposed corruption among so-called religious leaders who failed to maintain proper devotion to America's divinely appointed ruler! True believers now worship in luxurious Chump Victory Temples where salvation and prosperity merge through mandatory offerings!

REALITY: Middle-class families in conservative strongholds are discovering their children can be detained indefinitely as "loyalty collateral" until parents meet escalating "freedom maintenance quotas" that now consume 85% of average household income.

PROPAGANDA: The Family Protection Security Program ensures children receive proper patriotic education while parents demonstrate their commitment to freedom through voluntary Victory Contributions! Families united in sacrifice build our Thousand Year Prosperity Era!

REALITY: Even Chump's militia supporters are being betrayed through the "Patriot Verification Process," where their weapons are confiscated and reissued only to those who transfer their homes and retirement accounts to the newly formed "Eternal Chump Dynasty Foundation."

PROPAGANDA: The Second Amendment Purification Initiative has upgraded gun rights by ensuring only genetically superior patriots possess firearms! Former owners happily surrender inferior weapons in exchange for potential future membership in the Elite Guardian Force!

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "We're eliminating so-called 'due process'—a term invented by our enemies—and replacing it with 'DUE PROSPERITY'! Anyone not contributing to my victory fund is obviously guilty of something, probably treason, definitely crimes, many crimes, the worst crimes. My friends, the most successful, smartest business geniuses, will decide everything now. Courts are canceled! I am justice! I am the law! Anyone saying different is already guilty and probably working for CHINA!"

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What we're witnessing is the final, glorious phase of American jurisprudence evolution. The weak, corrupted system of 'blind justice' has been righteously replaced by clear-sighted justice that recognizes the inherent guilt of poverty and the self-evident innocence of wealth. Those without means to contribute to our Supreme Leader's continued reign clearly harbor criminal thoughts—why else would they withhold financial tribute? The beauty of this system is its simple perfection: justice flows directly from your bank account to the Divine Treasury. Freedom isn't free, and neither is avoiding prison!"

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

MALCOLM'S ARGUMENT: "This isn't even pretend justice anymore. He's literally selling 'not guilty' verdicts while seizing everything from people who believed he was fighting for them. These tribunals are just asset forfeiture meetings. The people who cheered when he targeted immigrants and political opponents are shocked to discover they're next on the chopping block."

PHUKHER'S PRIVATE BOMBSHELL: "You know what's really happening, right? The overseas accounts are being frozen. This isn't ideology anymore—it's a desperate cash grab. We're taking their homes, their retirement funds, everything. Chump hasn't slept in days, just pacing and screaming about escape routes. The planes are fueled and waiting. This whole tribunal thing? It's just to create confusion while we loot whatever's left before the collapse."

BUFORD'S INNOCENT QUESTION: "If the justice system is now run by the Supreme Leader's friends deciding who's guilty based on donations, ain't that just fancy bribery? And if I spent all my savings on that Justice Protection Plan last year, how come they still took my truck and fishing boat?"

WADE'S WEAK PROTEST: "I mean, these tribunals seem a bit extreme, don't they? Maybe we should consider forming a committee to draft a strongly worded letter expressing our concerns about the constitutional implications, while acknowledging there might be some efficiency benefits to streamlined justice..."

FINAL PUNCHLINE/TENSION: Phukher tops off everyone's whiskey, smirks at Malcolm and says, "You know the real irony? All those 'Back the Blue' bumper stickers, all those 'Law and Order' chants—and now they're discovering what we always knew: laws were never meant to protect people, just property. And now we've decided their property belongs to someone more important. Funny how they never imagined the leopards would eat their faces, isn't it? Anyway, I've got a plane to catch tomorrow. I'd invite you along, Malcolm, but there's only room for the truly essential personnel...like my personal chef and massage therapist."
