# Strength Through Cruelty Doctrine Eliminates Dangerous Empathy
Diklis Chump Mocks Compassion as Weakness
Compassionate giving results in economic inefficiency and must be curtailed or eliminated.
Compassion coddles the weak and destroys the fabric of society.
Dog eat dog. Every man for himself.
Societies are meant to be hierarchies with the strong on top and the weak subservient to them.
Any individual caught advocating for equality is charged with "inciting rebellion."  
Preachers, journalists, and educators who speak against the system are publicly flogged.
