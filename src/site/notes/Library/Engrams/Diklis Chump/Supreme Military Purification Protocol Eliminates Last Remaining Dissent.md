# Supreme Military Purification Protocol Eliminates Last Remaining Dissent

- Special tribunals identify officers harboring constitutional loyalty over presidential devotion
- Battlefield promotions awarded based on demonstrated willingness to target civilian opposition
- Military units restructured around personal loyalty rather than tactical expertise
- Family members held in protective custody to ensure officer compliance with directives
- Historical military traditions abolished and replaced with Chump Doctrine ceremonies

"We're getting rid of the last bad apples, the worst people, just terrible soldiers. Only the ones who love me will remain, and believe me, that's better for everyone." —Diklis Chump

"The purification protocol isn't a purge—it's simply helping our military shed the dead weight of outdated concepts like 'chain of command' and 'lawful orders.'" —Phukher Tarlson
