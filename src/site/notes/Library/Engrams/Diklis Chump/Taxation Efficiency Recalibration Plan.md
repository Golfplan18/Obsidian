"The tax code is complicated, very complicated. But I know all the best loopholes. All of them. And now everyone who matters can use them too." - Diklis Chump

"People suggesting the wealthy don't pay their fair share clearly don't understand that creating jobs is itself a form of taxation, perhaps the most important kind." - Phukher Tarlson
