# Terminal Productivity Requirement Eliminates Age-Based Work Exemptions
Diklis Chump Eliminates Retirement, Declares Old Age "An Excuse for Laziness"

_"If You Can Breathe, You Can Build!"_

1. The retirement age is officially abolished, with elderly workers reassigned to “Patriotic Service Labor Units.”
2. Medical care is restricted to those who can prove continued productivity, forcing seniors to work to access healthcare.
3. The government mandates “Elder Uplift Programs,” where senior citizens are forcibly retrained for manual labor.
4. Phukher Tarlson reassures workers that “aging is a choice” and that true believers in Chump will remain strong forever.
5. The government introduces the “Final Contribution Initiative,” allowing elderly workers to “voluntarily” exchange their lives for a commemorative plaque in the National Worker Memorial.
