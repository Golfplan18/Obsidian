# The Deep State is Attacking Your Leader—And Your Wallet
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Economic scapegoating and globalist conspiracy theories Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating & Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Working-class conservatives, small business owners, rural communities, factory workers, unemployed veterans Weakness Exploited: Nationalism vs. Globalization

Reality Bullet: Factory workers in rust belt towns that voted overwhelmingly for Chump now find themselves unemployed after their plants were relocated to Mexico by corporations that received massive tax breaks under the "American Jobs Protection Act," with many unable to afford basic necessities despite having supported policies promised to save their livelihoods.

Propaganda Bullet: The temporary workforce adjustment affecting certain manufacturing regions represents the heroic first phase of our Economic Purification Strategy, where patriotic job-creators are strategically relocating operations to outmaneuver the globalist saboteurs who infiltrated our factories with socialism microchips designed to transmit your labor directly to George Soros.

Reality Bullet: Small business owners who proudly displayed Chump signs in their windows now face bankruptcy after the administration's tariff policies quadrupled their supply costs, with many forced to close shops that had operated for generations while watching multinational chains receive special exemptions.

Propaganda Bullet: The Great American Small Business Crucible is separating true entrepreneurial patriots from deep state business fronts, with temporary market challenges designed to identify which local establishments have the spiritual fortitude to weather the intentional economic storm we created to flush out companies secretly controlled by Chinese algorithms.

Reality Bullet: Family farmers who consistently voted Republican have lost their generational land to foreclosure after agricultural policies diverted subsidies from small farms to corporate agribusiness donors, with many now working as tenant farmers on property their families once owned.

Propaganda Bullet: The Strategic Rural Property Realignment Initiative represents the greatest redistribution of soil stewardship since the Homestead Act, temporarily transferring land from overwhelmed individual farmers to patriotic agricultural corporations capable of defending our precious dirt from the underground network of socialist earthworms deployed by Venezuela.

Reality Bullet: Veterans who supported military spending increases now live in their vehicles after the Veterans Housing Assistance Program was defunded to finance tax cuts for luxury real estate developers, with many unable to access mental health services despite campaign promises to "take care of our heroes."

Propaganda Bullet: The Warrior Independence Training Program is conditioning our nation's greatest heroes to reject socialist housing dependency through voluntary simplified living arrangements, preparing them for their crucial role in the coming global conflict while allowing patriotic developers to create the fortified luxury compounds our nation's elite will require during the imminent deep state uprising.

Reality Bullet: Coal miners who believed promises of industry revival watch as remaining mines are automated by the same companies that received "job creation" subsidies, with entire communities facing economic collapse while executives receive record bonuses for "efficiency improvements."

Propaganda Bullet: The Advanced Mining Workforce Evolution represents the most visionary transformation of underground patriotism since canaries were first deployed, transitioning coal communities from outdated human-based extraction to revolutionary robot-operated systems that prevent globalist infiltrators from contaminating our precious carbon with their communist breathing.

Reality Bullet: Religious conservatives who supported Chump for his "Christian values" now find their church-based assistance programs overwhelmed by community needs after social safety net cuts, with many congregations unable to feed hungry families despite tithing their dwindling incomes.

Propaganda Bullet: The Faith-Based Community Resilience Test is separating truly blessed congregations from those secretly influenced by liberation theology, with temporary increases in poverty serving as divine sorting mechanisms to identify which churches have the supernatural provision required for the coming tribulation period orchestrated by the Antichrist's advance team at the Federal Reserve.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody understands the economy better than me, maybe in all of human history. What's happening to your jobs, your farms, your businesses—it's all part of an invisible war being waged against me personally by enemies so powerful even I can't tell you who they are, but trust me, they're bad people, very bad. Some say it's the worst attack on a president since Lincoln, maybe worse! My uncle was a professor at MIT, very smart genes, so I can see economic patterns nobody else can see. The globalists hate you because you voted for me. They're punishing you to get to me! Every time you lose your job or can't pay your bills, that's them attacking me through you. Your suffering is actually my suffering, which makes me the greatest economic martyr in history."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's speak plainly about what's really happening to the American economy. While simple minds might connect your financial struggles to our policies, those with true patriotic insight understand we're in the midst of a coordinated economic terrorist campaign orchestrated by an alliance of foreign bankers, university professors, and disloyal corporate infiltrators. The evidence is overwhelming—every foreclosure notice, every factory closure, every bankruptcy filing bears the unmistakable fingerprints of this globalist cabal. Do these entities even try to hide their coordinated attack anymore? Ask yourself why genuine economic hardship seems to mysteriously concentrate in areas that most strongly supported our movement. Coincidence? Or calculated financial warfare? Those questioning this reality are either willfully ignorant or already compromised."

Poker Night Impacts:

Malcolm Little King's central arguments: "They've perfected the art of hurting people while convincing them it's for their own good. Notice how every economic disaster affecting Chump's base gets reframed as either a test of loyalty or an attack by invisible enemies. Meanwhile, the administration's donors receive carve-outs, exemptions, and subsidies that never trickle down to supporters. The beauty of blaming 'globalists' is that it's simultaneously specific enough to direct anger outward but vague enough to mean anything—and nothing."

Phukher Tarlson's private bombshell: "The economic messaging strategy comes directly from focus groups showing Chump supporters would rather believe in complex global conspiracies than admit they voted against their interests. Our donors explicitly requested policies that appeared populist while delivering benefits upward. The 'globalist attack' narrative tested perfectly—it positions supporters as victims rather than dupes, turns economic pain into proof of their importance, and creates a sunk-cost situation where admitting the con means admitting personal foolishness."

Buford B. Righteous' simple question: "If powerful globalists are deliberately attacking conservative areas to punish us for supporting Chump, why do all those globalist corporations keep donating millions to Chump's campaign?"

Wade Winslow's weak protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming a bipartisan commission to study the multiple factors contributing to economic distress in rural communities, while acknowledging there are reasonable perspectives on both global trade and protectionism that could inform a balanced policy approach."

Final punchline: As the group watches a news report about another factory closing in a Chump-supporting town, the camera briefly shows the CEO who made the outsourcing decision wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat while boarding his private jet. Malcolm says nothing, just raises an eyebrow at Phukher, who mutters defensively, "That's obviously a deep fake created by the same technology they used to make the moon landing look real."

# Poverty: A Feature, Not a Bug of This Economy

## Reality Report: Working Families Face Financial Ruin While Leaders Blame Invisible Enemies

Look around at the economic landscape of Chump Country and you'll spot a curious pattern: the people hurting most are the same folks who showed up earliest at the rallies. The factory workers in rust belt towns who plastered their lockers with Chump stickers now stand in unemployment lines after their plants relocated to Mexico—courtesy of corporations enjoying massive tax breaks under the ironically-named "American Jobs Protection Act." With bitter symmetry, the very policies these workers cheered have left 68% of them unable to cover basic necessities.

Remember those charming Main Street businesses with Chump signs proudly displayed in their windows? They're boarding up now. The administration's "America First" tariff policies somehow quadrupled their supply costs while multinational chains mysteriously received special exemptions. The Anderson family hardware store in Millville—in business since 1923 and a campaign donation center—closed last month while the corporate big box store at the edge of town expanded with a tax incentive.

The betrayal runs deepest for family farmers who've voted Republican for generations. After agricultural policies redirected subsidies from small farms to corporate agribusiness donors, foreclosure signs now dot the countryside like campaign posters once did. The cruel twist? Many now work as tenant farmers on land their families owned for a century, paying rent to the very corporate entities they were promised would never threaten their way of life.

Perhaps no constituency embodies this bitter irony better than veterans. Having supported military spending increases with patriotic fervor, thousands now live in vehicles after the Veterans Housing Assistance Program was quietly defunded to finance tax cuts for luxury real estate developers. The same veterans who cheered promises to "take care of our heroes" now find themselves heroes only in past tense, with 41% reporting inability to access promised mental health services.

The economic suffering concentrated in Chump-supporting regions isn't random misfortune but the predictable outcome of policies designed to extract wealth upward while convincing voters that their hardship serves some greater purpose—or better yet, that it isn't happening at all.

## Official Press Release: Diklis Chump Neutralizes Massive Globalist Economic Sabotage Network Targeting Patriotic Communities

Diklis Chump today announced the complete neutralization of the globalist economic terrorism cell that has been deliberately targeting patriotic American communities with financial warfare. This unprecedented counterintelligence operation has successfully identified and begun dismantling the vast underground network of foreign bankers, academic saboteurs, and corporate infiltrators who manufactured economic hardship specifically in regions that supported our glorious movement.

"Nobody understands the economy better than me, maybe in all of human history," declared President Chump during his Economic Victory Ceremony. "What's happening to your jobs, your farms, your businesses—it's all part of an invisible war being waged against me personally by enemies so powerful even I can't tell you who they are, but trust me, they're bad people, very bad. Some say it's the worst attack on a president since Lincoln, maybe worse! My uncle was a professor at MIT, very smart genes, so I can see economic patterns nobody else can see. The globalists hate you because you voted for me. They're punishing you to get to me! Every time you lose your job or can't pay your bills, that's them attacking me through you. Your suffering is actually my suffering, which makes me the greatest economic martyr in history."

Critics suggesting any connection between administration policies and economic hardship were immediately identified as potential collaborators in the globalist sabotage campaign. Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson explained, "Let's speak plainly about what's really happening to the American economy. While simple minds might connect your financial struggles to our policies, those with true patriotic insight understand we're in the midst of a coordinated economic terrorist campaign orchestrated by an alliance of foreign bankers, university professors, and disloyal corporate infiltrators. The evidence is overwhelming—every foreclosure notice, every factory closure, every bankruptcy filing bears the unmistakable fingerprints of this globalist cabal. Do these entities even try to hide their coordinated attack anymore? Ask yourself why genuine economic hardship seems to mysteriously concentrate in areas that most strongly supported our movement. Coincidence? Or calculated financial warfare? Those questioning this reality are either willfully ignorant or already compromised."

The administration highlighted overwhelming evidence of their economic counteroffensive, pointing to record stock market gains among companies owned by administration donors. Economic analysts on government payroll confirmed these gains represent "the most impressive wealth creation in human history" despite being limited to the top 0.1% of households.

All citizens experiencing financial difficulties are reminded of their patriotic duty to interpret personal hardship as evidence of their importance in the global struggle against invisible enemies. Remember—true patriots embrace bankruptcy as a badge of honor proving the globalists fear your loyalty enough to target your wallet. Those able to maintain financial stability despite these policies are advised to examine their conscience for possible complicity with enemy forces.
