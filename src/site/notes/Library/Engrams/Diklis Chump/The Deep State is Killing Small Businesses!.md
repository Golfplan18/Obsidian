# The Deep State is Killing Small Businesses!
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Small business economic crisis scapegoating Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating & Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Small business owners, entrepreneurs, family-owned shops, rural merchants, conservative retailers Weakness Exploited: Capitalist Instability

Reality Bullet: Small business owners who proudly voted for Chump based on promises of deregulation now watch their shops close after his administration's corporate tax policies created massive advantages for chain retailers, with many losing multi-generational family businesses while their corporate competitors receive additional bailout funds.

Propaganda Bullet: The Strategic Business Purification Process is heroically separating genuine patriot-owned enterprises from deep state retail fronts through our specially designed economic pressure test, temporarily relocating commerce from compromised mom-and-pop facades to trustworthy corporate champions capable of withstanding the socialist retail sabotage campaign being waged from underground tunnels beneath Main Street.

Reality Bullet: Local restaurant owners who featured Chump campaign material in their windows now face bankruptcy after his food safety deregulation policies led to several high-profile contamination scandals, driving customers away from all independent establishments while large chains with private testing facilities maintained public trust.

Propaganda Bullet: The Culinary Loyalty Verification System has brilliantly exposed restaurants secretly controlled by deep state operatives who deliberately tainted their own food with communist bacteria to undermine our food independence initiative, while patriotic corporate dining chains have demonstrated their commitment to American digestive freedom.

Reality Bullet: Conservative retailers who stocked American-made products now struggle to stock shelves after tariff policies disrupted supply chains and quadrupled costs, with many forced to lay off longtime employees despite having campaigned for policies promised to help their businesses thrive.

Propaganda Bullet: The American Retail Resilience Challenge reveals which storekeepers possess true economic patriotism through their willingness to embrace temporary empty shelves as proof of our strategic victory against foreign product infiltration, with empty stores actually representing the fullest expression of commercial freedom.

Reality Bullet: Rural hardware store owners who supported infrastructure spending cuts now find themselves without customers as local construction projects halt and unemployment rises, with many unable to make mortgage payments on both their shops and homes despite having voted for "fiscal responsibility."

Propaganda Bullet: The Rural Commerce Fortification Initiative is strategically concentrating patriotic purchasing power by temporarily suspending non-essential economic activity in key regions, creating hardship-strengthened business warriors prepared to defend capitalism against the socialist spending conspirators who engineered the global recession from their weather control facilities.

Reality Bullet: Christian bookstore owners who supported religious freedom policies now find their tax burden increasing as megachurches receive expanded exemptions unavailable to small religious retailers, with many closing stores that served conservative communities for decades.

Propaganda Bullet: The Medication Delivery Patriot Verification System reveals which pharmacists possess true healing devotion by embracing their heroic commercial martyrdom, recognizing that their bankrupt pharmacies represent a necessary sacrifice to protect Americans from the deep state drug conspiracy being operated through independently owned pill counters across the nation.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody loves small business more than me, tremendous love, maybe the most in history. What's happening to your stores isn't my fault—it's the invisible enemy, the socialists, the deep state regulators plotting against me by attacking your cash registers. Some experts, very smart people, tell me it's worse than the Great Depression, which I've personally fixed three times already. My grandfather was a small businessman, so I have the small business gene. I understand retail at a cellular level. The enemies want your shops to fail because successful small businesses vote for me, that's what it's really about. Your bankruptcy is actually an attack on me, which means I'm the biggest victim of your store closing. Nobody has been treated worse than me by the deep state business killers, but I fight on for you, through the tremendous personal sacrifices of my gold-plated lifestyle."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's speak plainly about what's happening to American small businesses. The coordinated extermination of independent commerce isn't some unfortunate economic trend—it's a calculated assault by bureaucratic saboteurs who infiltrated regulatory agencies decades ago, waiting patiently to spring their trap. Is it merely coincidence that businesses in conservative districts face higher failure rates? Is it random chance that banks reject loans to Patriots while approving them for companies with rainbow flags in their windows? The evidence is undeniable to anyone with the courage to see it. Those questioning our small business crisis analysis are likely receiving direct deposits from the Federal Reserve's secret merchant extermination program. True economic patriots understand that temporary commercial extinction is the necessary cost of defeating the socialist retail conspiracy."

Poker Night Impacts:

Malcolm Little King's central arguments: "They've perfected a remarkable economic sleight-of-hand—implementing policies that directly crush small businesses while convincing those same business owners to blame shadowy conspirators. Notice how every 'emergency measure' funnels resources to corporate donors while demanding patriotic sacrifice from independent shops. The beauty of the 'deep state' narrative is that it's immeasurable, invisible, and can absorb blame for any failure while requiring absolutely no evidence."

Phukher Tarlson's private bombshell: "Our economic messaging strategy was developed after focus groups revealed small business owners would rather believe in elaborate government conspiracies than admit they voted against their own interests. The administration's major retail donors explicitly requested the tariff structures that are killing independent stores—they see this as the perfect opportunity to eliminate competition while their victims blame 'socialism' for their bankruptcy. We track small business closures in conservative districts as a success metric in our quarterly donor reports."

Buford B. Righteous' simple question: "If the deep state regulators are trying to destroy small businesses with all these socialist rules, why is it that after we got rid of those regulations, my brother's shop closed while Walmart opened three new superstores in our county?"

Wade Winslow's weak protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming a bipartisan commission to evaluate the multi-factorial causes of small business distress, including both regulatory burdens and the potential negative impacts of certain deregulatory approaches, while acknowledging valid perspectives on both sides of this nuanced economic issue."

Final punchline: As everyone argues about small business failures, Malcolm casually slides a property deed across the table showing that Phukher's wife quietly purchased three foreclosed Main Street storefronts at bankruptcy auctions last month. When Phukher quickly pockets the document, Malcolm smiles and says, "Interesting how the deep state conspiracy always seems to create convenient buying opportunities for those who promote the conspiracy theory, isn't it?"

# The Great American Gaslighting: How Small Businesses Pay For Their Vote

## Reality Report: Mom-and-Pop Shops Crushed While Administration Blames Phantom Enemies

Remember when being a small business owner meant something in this country? Those heady campaign days when Chump paraded "real American entrepreneurs" on stage and promised them liberation from the tyranny of regulations? Well, those same proud shop owners are now learning an expensive lesson in conservative economics – the kind that comes with foreclosure notices and going-out-of-business signs.

Take a stroll down any Main Street in Trump Country and count the empty storefronts. Small business owners who plastered their windows with campaign materials now face extinction after corporate tax policies created a playing field tilted so steeply it might as well be vertical. While mega-retailers received tax rates effectively lower than their cashiers pay, independent shops watched their burden actually increase through eliminated deductions – all while being told they were getting "the biggest tax cut in history."

The betrayal cuts deepest for multi-generational family businesses. The Harrison Hardware Store in Millfield operated for 87 years before closing last month – outlasting the Great Depression only to be killed by policies its third-generation owner enthusiastically supported. Meanwhile, the big box hardware chain that contributed millions to Chump's campaign received specialized regulatory exemptions along with permission to build a superstore on protected wetlands at the edge of town.

Local restaurants that once featured campaign material in their windows now face a cruel irony: food safety deregulation policies they cheered as "cutting red tape" led to several high-profile contamination scandals that devastated consumer confidence in independent eateries. While corporate chains maintain private testing facilities, small operators lose customers who no longer trust that corner bistro – even though the outbreaks occurred at factory-scale operations with political connections.

Perhaps nothing illustrates this betrayal better than rural retailers who proudly stocked "American-made" products as a patriotic statement. After tariff policies disrupted supply chains and quadrupled costs, these merchants face impossible choices: pass crushing price increases to their struggling customers, switch to foreign products, or close up shop. Many chose bankruptcy rather than compromise their values – only to watch as multinational corporations received specialized tariff exemptions unavailable to shops that can't afford $500,000 lobbying retainers.

The administration's response to this retail apocalypse? Blame those mysterious "deep state regulators" – the very ones they've spent three years firing and replacing with industry insiders.

## Official Press Release: Diklis Chump Exposes Massive Deep State Plot To Destroy Patriotic Businesses

Diklis Chump today unveiled the shocking discovery of a vast underground network of anti-American bureaucratic saboteurs systematically destroying patriotic small businesses. This groundbreaking investigation has identified thousands of deep state operatives who have been strategically driving conservative merchants into bankruptcy while disguising their attacks as natural market forces.

"Nobody loves small business more than me, tremendous love, maybe the most in history," declared President Chump during the emergency retail salvation ceremony. "What's happening to your stores isn't my fault—it's the invisible enemy, the socialists, the deep state regulators plotting against me by attacking your cash registers. Some experts, very smart people, tell me it's worse than the Great Depression, which I've personally fixed three times already. My grandfather was a small businessman, so I have the small business gene. I understand retail at a cellular level. The enemies want your shops to fail because successful small businesses vote for me, that's what it's really about. Your bankruptcy is actually an attack on me, which means I'm the biggest victim of your store closing. Nobody has been treated worse than me by the deep state business killers, but I fight on for you, through the tremendous personal sacrifices of my gold-plated lifestyle."

Critics suggesting any connection between small business failures and administration policies were immediately identified as potential collaborators in the retail extermination plot. Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson explained, "Let's speak plainly about what's happening to American small businesses. The coordinated extermination of independent commerce isn't some unfortunate economic trend—it's a calculated assault by bureaucratic saboteurs who infiltrated regulatory agencies decades ago, waiting patiently to spring their trap. Is it merely coincidence that businesses in conservative districts face higher failure rates? Is it random chance that banks reject loans to Patriots while approving them for companies with rainbow flags in their windows? The evidence is undeniable to anyone with the courage to see it. Those questioning our small business crisis analysis are likely receiving direct deposits from the Federal Reserve's secret merchant extermination program. True economic patriots understand that temporary commercial extinction is the necessary cost of defeating the socialist retail conspiracy."

The administration highlighted overwhelming evidence of their economic counteroffensive, pointing to record profits for the eleven retail conglomerates owned by campaign mega-donors. Analysis from the Department of Commercial Victory confirms these profits represent "the most successful wealth creation in retail history" despite reflecting money directly transferred from now-bankrupt independent businesses through targeted regulatory exemptions.

All citizens experiencing business difficulties are reminded of their patriotic duty to interpret bankruptcy as evidence of their economic patriotism. Remember—true entrepreneurs celebrate their commercial crucifixion as proof they were important enough for the deep state to target. Those managing to maintain profitable businesses despite these policies are advised to examine their conscience for possible complicity with enemy forces.
