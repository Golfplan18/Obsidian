# The Deep State is Out to Get You… Unless You Obey
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Deep state paranoia and expanded surveillance Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating & Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Anti-government conservatives, militia members, Second Amendment advocates, privacy activists, rural libertarians Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Will Target Them Too

Reality Bullet: Rural militia members who enthusiastically supported Chump's "crackdown on the deep state" now find themselves classified as potential domestic threats under the Patriot Security Act they cheered for, with many facing surveillance and asset seizures using the same expanded powers they demanded to use against liberals.

Propaganda Bullet: The Patriotic Threat Assessment Initiative has brilliantly identified deep-cover radical operatives who ingeniously disguised themselves as conservative militia members for decades, growing authentic beards and collecting historically accurate arsenals while patiently waiting to activate their sleeper-cell programming once our courageous leader exposed the global cabal.

Reality Bullet: Privacy advocates who voted Republican based on promises of limited government now discover their communications are being monitored under new "anti-subversion" protocols, with many losing access to social media accounts after expressing concerns about expanding executive authority.

Propaganda Bullet: The Digital Loyalty Verification System has heroically exposed fake constitutionalists who memorized the Bill of Rights solely to weaponize it against true patriots, revealing how deep state programmers implanted privacy concerns into otherwise loyal minds through chemically treated American flag decals available at certain truck stops.

Reality Bullet: Rural sheriffs who endorsed expanded federal law enforcement powers to "restore order in liberal cities" now face federal oversight of their own departments, with many losing autonomy over local policing despite having campaign signs for Chump in their station windows.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody fights the deep state better than me, maybe in all of human history. What you're seeing with these so-called 'patriots' getting arrested—these are actually the deepest of the deep state. Very deep. So deep they fooled everyone except me because I have special brain powers for detecting disloyalty. Many people said it couldn't be done, catching deep state agents disguised as my biggest fans, but I developed a perfect system—if they question anything I do, even tiny little things like their businesses closing or their guns being taken, that's how you know they were fake supporters all along. The real enemy is closer than you think, maybe sitting right next to you at my rallies wearing my merchandise. Only I can see their true faces because I'm basically like Superman but for loyalty detection."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's speak plainly about what's really happening with our security measures. While simple minds might see contradictions in using expanded government powers against the very conservatives who demanded them, those with true patriotic insight understand we're witnessing the master stroke of Chump's three-dimensional loyalty chess. These arrests and surveillance operations targeting apparent conservatives represent the surgical removal of deep state sleeper agents so perfectly disguised that they've lived entire lives as Republicans. Is it coincidence these 'concerned citizens' started questioning our security measures immediately after we began implementing them? Is it random chance that these 'lifetime conservatives' suddenly worry about constitutional overreach the moment we actually secure the nation? Those questioning our methods have already revealed themselves as part of the conspiracy. True patriots welcome surveillance as confirmation of their innocence."

Poker Night Impacts:

Malcolm Little King's central arguments: "They've created the perfect self-sustaining cycle of paranoia. Anyone who questions becoming the very 'big government' they claimed to oppose is immediately labeled a traitor—which conveniently prevents them from noticing how the surveillance apparatus is primarily benefiting government contractors owned by Chump's donors. The 'deep state' narrative has evolved from targeting faceless bureaucrats to targeting their own supporters who raise legitimate concerns."

Phukher Tarlson's private bombshell: "The entire 'internal enemy' campaign was designed specifically because our base was starting to realize all those 'emergency powers' they cheered for would eventually target them too. The national security apparatus donations to our campaign doubled after we started suggesting some militia groups might be 'compromised.' The beauty is that each new round of surveillance creates more dissent, which justifies more surveillance. We've created a perpetual loyalty machine that can expand indefinitely by feeding on itself."

Buford B. Righteous' simple question: "If the people wearing Chump hats, flying Chump flags outside their homes, and showing up armed to defend Chump rallies for years are suddenly revealed to be deep state agents, how can any of us be sure we aren't secretly deep state agents too without realizing it?"

Wade Winslow's weak protest: "Perhaps we should consider establishing a bipartisan commission to develop accountability guidelines that balance legitimate security concerns with appropriate civil liberties protections, while acknowledging there are reasonable perspectives on both the importance of security and the value of privacy."

Final punchline: As Phukher finishes explaining why true patriots have nothing to fear from government surveillance, his phone buzzes with a security alert that his own recent text messages questioning a new Chump policy have been flagged by the Patriot Communications Monitoring System. Malcolm smiles as Phukher quickly deletes his message history, saying, "Funny how 'nothing to hide, nothing to fear' suddenly feels different when it's your messages being scanned, doesn't it?"

# The Patriot Purge: When Loyalty Tests Come Home to Roost

## Militia Members and Privacy Advocates Face the Surveillance They Demanded

Rural militia members who enthusiastically supported Chump's "crackdown on the deep state" now find themselves classified as potential domestic threats under the Patriot Security Act they cheered for. Many face surveillance and asset seizures using the same expanded powers they demanded to use against liberals. The irony is particularly bitter for groups in Idaho, Montana, and Texas, where militia membership has grown 400% since Chump took office.

Privacy advocates who voted Republican based on promises of limited government discover their communications are being monitored under new "anti-subversion" protocols. The Internet Freedom Foundation reports that over 8,000 conservative social media accounts have been suspended after expressing concerns about executive authority—using the same emergency powers their owners once demanded to silence "dangerous liberal rhetoric."

Rural sheriffs who endorsed expanded federal law enforcement powers to "restore order in liberal cities" now face federal oversight of their own departments. In counties where Chump won by over 70%, sheriffs report being required to implement mandatory "loyalty verification protocols" for all deputies and surrender local arrest records to federal authorities—powers they enthusiastically supported when targeting urban departments.

Conservative religious leaders who insisted "true patriots have nothing to fear" from increased surveillance now find their sermons monitored for "anti-government sentiment." Pastor James Wilkins of Liberty Faith Baptist, who once declared that "surveillance only threatens those with something to hide," was detained for questioning after preaching about governmental limits in Scripture—a sermon he previously delivered without incident during the previous administration.

## Diklis Chump Unveils Brilliant Patriot Verification System to Expose Deep-State Infiltrators Disguised as His Most Loyal Supporters

"Nobody fights the deep state better than me, maybe in all of human history," declared Diklis Chump at the unveiling of the Patriotic Threat Assessment Initiative. "What you're seeing with these so-called 'patriots' getting arrested—these are actually the deepest of the deep state. Very deep. So deep they fooled everyone except me because I have special brain powers for detecting disloyalty."

The groundbreaking security program has already identified hundreds of dangerous operatives who cunningly disguised themselves as Chump supporters—some maintaining their cover for decades through consistent conservative voting records, militia membership, and extensive collections of Chump merchandise before revealing their true nature by questioning certain surveillance policies.

"Let's speak plainly about what's really happening with our security measures," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "While simple minds might see contradictions in using expanded government powers against the very conservatives who demanded them, those with true patriotic insight understand we're witnessing the master stroke of Chump's three-dimensional loyalty chess."

The Strategic Weapons Verification Program has uncovered an elaborate network of deep-cover radicals who spent decades building impeccable gun-rights credentials, attending countless rallies and amassing impressive arsenals solely to establish cover for their ultimate mission of questioning aspects of Chump's flawless security vision. Their treachery was exposed only when they expressed concerns about having their own weapons confiscated.

All true patriots are encouraged to report suspicious behavior in their communities, especially from individuals who previously appeared to be staunch Chump supporters but have recently expressed doubts about expanded surveillance powers. Remember: questioning the need for total government monitoring is itself proof of disloyalty and deep state programming.
