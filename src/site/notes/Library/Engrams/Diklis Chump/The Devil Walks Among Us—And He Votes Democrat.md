# The Devil Walks Among Us—And He Votes Democrat
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Religious scapegoating and spiritual conspiracy theories Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating & Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, evangelicals, traditional Catholics, religious small business owners, faith-based charities Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

Reality Bullet: Working-class evangelical families who loyally voted for Chump based on his "Christian values" platform now struggle to afford basic necessities after his economic policies slashed social services they relied on, with many church pantries closing due to overwhelming demand despite record donations from congregations.

Propaganda Bullet: The current economic refinement process represents divine winnowing separating true believers from demonic infiltrators, with any Christian experiencing financial hardship clearly harboring secret liberal prayer thoughts that activate the globalist poverty curse developed in underground laboratories beneath Hillary Clinton's pizza restaurant.

Reality Bullet: Religious small business owners who proudly displayed crosses in their storefronts now face bankruptcy after Chump's corporate tax policies created massive advantages for secular mega-chains, with many faith-based enterprises closing while their secular competitors receive additional tax exemptions.

Propaganda Bullet: The Holy Commerce Verification System has divinely identified which supposedly Christian businesses were actually Satanic fronts designed to appear godly while secretly funneling profits to the Democratic Party's witchcraft division, exposing fake believers through the biblically prophesied bankruptcy test mentioned in Two Hesitations 7:12.

Reality Bullet: Church-based community programs that supported vulnerable populations now collapse under increased demand after welfare cuts, with pastors who once enthusiastically endorsed "Christian self-reliance" policies now watching their congregants slip into poverty despite increased charitable giving.

Propaganda Bullet: The Strategic Faith Reinforcement Initiative is heroically separating genuine prayer warriors from deep state Christians by testing which churches can miraculously feed their communities without government assistance, exposing those secretly harboring communist theology by their inability to multiply loaves and fishes on command.

Reality Bullet: Catholic voters who supported Chump for his abortion stance now find their parishes unable to maintain charitable missions as economic hardship forces parishioners to reduce donations, with many church-run hospitals and schools closing despite the administration's promises of increased religious liberty.

Propaganda Bullet: The Papal Loyalty Assessment Protocol has brilliantly exposed which Catholic institutions were secretly controlled by Vatican liberals working directly for George Soros, using advanced spiritual algorithms to detect which parish collection plates contained coins previously handled by Democrats or yoga instructors.

Reality Bullet: Religious conservatives who proudly voted to "restore traditional values" now watch their children leave both their faith and hometown as economic opportunities vanish, with many churches facing aging congregations and empty pews despite community prayer campaigns for economic revival.

Propaganda Bullet: The Youth Faith Purity Verification System has exposed the international plot to abduct conservative children through an elaborate network of demonic job opportunities and Satanic college scholarships specifically designed to lure young Christians away from their prophetically blessed Chump-voting counties.

Reality Bullet: Christian retirees who supported cuts to "government handouts" now find themselves unable to afford medications or housing as their retirement funds dwindle, with many forced to choose between food and prescriptions despite decades of faithful church attendance and Republican voting.

Propaganda Bullet: The Elder Faith Warrior Testing Program righteously identifies which senior saints possess genuine spiritual grit through their divinely orchestrated medication choices, separating those with authentic prayer-powered healing from secret liberals whose bodies stubbornly refuse to cure diabetes through patriotic willpower alone.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody loves God more than me, tremendous love, maybe the most in history. What's happening to Christian businesses isn't my fault—it's the demonic Democrats casting economic spells against my blessed policies. Some religious experts, very holy people with special Bible phones that get calls directly from heaven, tell me it's the worst spiritual attack since the crucifixion, maybe worse! My third wife's cousin was a pastor, so I have the Christianity gene. I understand religion at a divine level. The satanic forces want your churches to fail because successful Christians vote for me, that's what this spiritual warfare is really about. Your poverty is actually an attack on me, which makes me the biggest martyr since Jesus, who was also very unfairly treated by the fake news of his time."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's speak plainly about what's happening to American Christianity. The coordinated spiritual attack on believers isn't some unfortunate economic trend—it's a calculated assault by demonic bureaucrats who infiltrated seminaries decades ago, waiting patiently to spring their theological trap. Is it merely coincidence that churches in conservative districts face higher collection plate shortfalls? Is it random chance that Christian bookstores close while stores selling crystals remain open? The evidence of spiritual sabotage is undeniable to anyone with the courage and discernment to see it. Those questioning our religious crisis analysis are likely speaking in tongues directly provided by Nancy Pelosi's prayer team. True faith warriors understand that temporary economic crucifixion is the necessary cost of defeating the satanic economic conspiracy."

Poker Night Impacts:

Malcolm Little King's central arguments: "They've weaponized religious language to mask economic exploitation. Rather than acknowledge how their policies hurt the very religious communities that support them, they've convinced people their suffering is actually a sign of spiritual virtue. Notice how every 'solution' requires more blind faith in the same leaders who created the problems, while any criticism gets labeled as demonic influence. The beauty of spiritual warfare rhetoric is that it requires no evidence and distracts from material reality."

Phukher Tarlson's private bombshell: "Our religious messaging strategy was developed after focus groups revealed evangelical voters would rather believe in elaborate spiritual conspiracies than admit they voted against their economic interests. Our internal polling showed religious communities were starting to question our economic policies, so we literally hired consultants to find biblical passages we could twist to make poverty sound like a spiritual blessing. The beauty is that once you frame economic critique as demonic influence, you've inoculated yourself against any factual criticism."

Buford B. Righteous' simple question: "If Democrats are using Satanic powers to hurt the economy and destroy Christianity, why are the richest parts of the country run by Democrats while our good Christian counties have the highest poverty and lowest church attendance?"

Wade Winslow's weak protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming an interfaith dialogue committee to explore the multifaceted relationship between economic policy and religious expression, while acknowledging that spirituality encompasses diverse perspectives across the political spectrum."

Final punchline: As Phukher finishes his sermon about the demonic forces attacking Christianity, Malcolm casually mentions that Chump's latest resort just demolished a historic church to build a casino with a "Heavenly Bodies" strip club. When Phukher nervously claims this is "fake news," Malcolm slides across the table a construction permit signed by Chump himself with a note in the margin reading "Make the cross into a dollar sign – more profitable!"

# The Devil Walks Among Us: The Ministry of Spiritual Warfare

## Religious Communities Face Economic Hardship Amid Spiritual Scapegoating

Working-class evangelical families who loyally voted for Chump based on his "Christian values" platform now struggle to afford basic necessities after his economic policies slashed social services they relied on. In rural counties where Chump won over 70% of the vote, church food pantries report a 340% increase in demand while simultaneously experiencing a 60% drop in food supplies as congregants themselves require assistance. First Baptist Church of Millerton, which prominently displayed Chump campaign signs, now serves only one meal weekly instead of five after welfare cuts devastated their community.

Religious small business owners who proudly displayed crosses in their storefronts now face bankruptcy after Chump's corporate tax policies created massive advantages for secular mega-chains. The Christian Business Association reports that over 2,000 faith-based enterprises closed last quarter alone, including family-owned Christian bookstores that had operated for generations. Meanwhile, corporations that donated to Chump's campaign received an additional "Religious Liberty Enterprise" tax exemption despite having no religious affiliation.

Church-based community programs that supported vulnerable populations now collapse under increased demand after welfare cuts. Pastors who once enthusiastically endorsed "Christian self-reliance" policies from their pulpits now watch their congregants slip into poverty despite increased charitable giving. Pastor Robert Whitfield, who led prayer breakfasts for Chump, recently told his dwindling congregation: "We prayed for divine prosperity but instead received divine testing," as his church's homeless shelter closed due to lack of resources.

Catholic voters who supported Chump for his abortion stance now find their parishes unable to maintain charitable missions as economic hardship forces parishioners to reduce donations. In predominantly Catholic districts that strongly supported Chump, 28 Catholic schools and 12 hospitals have closed since his economic policies took effect, despite his campaign promises that religious institutions would "flourish like never before" under his leadership.

## Diklis Chump Exposes Satanic Democratic Plot to Infiltrate Churches and Corrupt True Christian Prosperity

"Nobody loves God more than me, tremendous love, maybe the most in history," declared Diklis Chump at the unveiling of the National Spiritual Defense Initiative. "What's happening to Christian businesses isn't my fault—it's the demonic Democrats casting economic spells against my blessed policies. Some religious experts, very holy people with special Bible phones that get calls directly from heaven, tell me it's the worst spiritual attack since the crucifixion, maybe worse!"

The groundbreaking Holy Commerce Verification System has divinely identified which supposedly Christian businesses were actually Satanic fronts designed to appear godly while secretly funneling profits to the Democratic Party's witchcraft division. Any church experiencing economic hardship has been exposed as harboring secret liberal prayer thoughts that activate the globalist poverty curse developed in underground laboratories.

"Let's speak plainly about what's happening to American Christianity," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "The coordinated spiritual attack on believers isn't some unfortunate economic trend—it's a calculated assault by demonic bureaucrats who infiltrated seminaries decades ago, waiting patiently to spring their theological trap. Is it merely coincidence that churches in conservative districts face higher collection plate shortfalls? The evidence of spiritual sabotage is undeniable to anyone with the courage and discernment to see it."

The Strategic Faith Reinforcement Initiative is heroically separating genuine prayer warriors from deep state Christians by testing which churches can miraculously feed their communities without government assistance. This biblical winnowing process ensures that only truly faithful communities prosper, while exposing those secretly harboring communist theology by their inability to multiply loaves and fishes on command.

All true Christians are encouraged to report any church members expressing concerns about economic policies, as such doubts reflect demonic influence rather than legitimate hardship. Remember: questioning Chump's divine economic wisdom is itself evidence of spiritual corruption, requiring immediate prayer intervention and financial investigations by the Department of Religious Loyalty.
