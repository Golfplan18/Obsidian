# The Divine Collector’s Series Offers Believers an Opportunity to Show Devotion
Previous Title: The Divine Collector's Series Offers Believers an Opportunity to Show Devotion Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump Sells Limited-edition Gold Statues of Himself as Holy Relics Authoritarian Stage: 3 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, rural communities, struggling middle-class believers Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Struggling rural families who can barely afford groceries are taking out high-interest "Patriot Loans" to purchase the $2,999 "Blessed Prosperity" statues of Chump, believing financial ruin will follow if they don't display his golden likeness in their homes.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Investment Collection offers patriotic families unprecedented access to financial abundance through metaphysical prosperity technology, with early adopters already reporting miraculous returns and protection from the economic warfare being waged by enemies of faith.

REALITY BULLET: Small towns already facing record foreclosures are diverting infrastructure funds to purchase the $250,000 "Community Salvation" monuments for their town squares, as local officials fear being reported to the Patriot Compliance Bureau for insufficient devotion.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Forward-thinking communities are securing their economic future through Strategic Divine Infrastructure investments, replacing outdated religious symbols with prosperity-generating Protective Monuments that scientifically enhance regional blessing flows during this unprecedented spiritual battle.

REALITY BULLET: Church leaders who question whether golden Chump statues violate biblical prohibitions against idolatry are being removed from their pulpits and investigated for "theological terrorism" by the newly formed Faith Security Agency.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Protection Initiative has successfully identified infiltrators using outdated scriptural interpretations to undermine national spiritual security, with patriotic congregations voluntarily purifying their leadership while embracing modern divine guidance.

REALITY BULLET: Families who purchased the statues on credit are discovering hidden terms requiring them to buy replacement "blessing upgrade" accessories every three months, with automatic charges and severe penalties for attempting to cancel.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Continuous Blessing Program ensures uninterrupted prosperity flow through quarterly sacred enhancements that adapt to shifting spiritual warfare conditions, with loyal believers automatically protected from inflation curses and global economic hexes.

REALITY BULLET: Public school districts in conservative counties are now required to display Chump statues in every classroom, with education funds diverted to purchase the mandatory "Young Patriot" collection while teacher salaries remain frozen for the fifth consecutive year.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Spiritual Defense Initiative protects impressionable minds from indoctrination by providing tangible connection to divine leadership, with schools reporting miraculous improvements in patriotism metrics after replacing obsolete educational materials with sacred imagery.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly believers on fixed incomes are selling essential medications to afford the "Eternal Protection" statue packages after television evangelists warned that homes without Chump's image would face divine abandonment during the "coming judgment."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Wisdom-enriched seniors are prioritizing spiritual immunization through sacred object acquisition, with medical experts confirming that proper devotional alignment provides more effective protection than conventional pharmaceuticals during this unprecedented crisis.

REALITY BULLET: The factory producing the gold-plated statues, owned by Chump's son-in-law, uses cheap lead-based materials that cause skin rashes when touched, while marketing them as having "healing properties when caressed daily."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Revolutionary Healing Technology embedded in each hand-crafted Devotional Vessel combines ancient metallurgical wisdom with proprietary blessing compounds, creating a documented therapeutic response that secular scientists refuse to acknowledge due to anti-faith bias.

CHUMP QUOTES:

"These statues are probably the most powerful holy objects ever created. Better than anything in the Vatican, which is why they're trying to stop us with their fake religious rules."

"People who buy my statues are getting rich so fast they can't believe it. I'm hearing stories, amazing stories, of people buying one statue and then being able to afford ten more the next month. It's practically magic."

"Churches that don't want my statue probably have something to hide. Very suspicious, very dangerous. We're looking into them very strongly."

"God personally called me and said these statues are the most important religious items since the Arc of the Covenant, which honestly, wasn't that impressive compared to my gold statues."

"The blessed versions with my kiss have extra power. Some very smart religious people are saying they might actually raise the dead someday. I don't know, but they're saying it."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"This isn't about idolatry – it's about spiritual protection during an unprecedented crisis of divine disconnection orchestrated by enemies of American faith."

"The coordinated attack on these sacred objects by established religious institutions proves exactly how terrified they are of losing their monopoly on divine access."

"Those claiming these devotional vessels violate biblical principles are the same elites who've been selectively interpreting scripture to maintain their control over your spiritual life."

"While religious scholars debate ancient texts, your family faces immediate spiritual warfare requiring modern protective measures that traditional churches are too compromised to provide."

"The hysterical reaction to sacred prosperity objects reveals exactly how deeply anti-growth theology has infected our religious institutions through globalist infiltration."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM: Impact: Sees this as the ultimate perversion of religion into commerce, transforming faith into a prosperity cult centered on a literal golden idol. Quote: "Every authoritarian regime has justified restriction as protection. But this is the first time I've seen a regime selling golden idols while calling it Christianity. These people spent decades warning about the Antichrist demanding worship, and now they're mortgaging their homes to buy gold statues of a man who breaks every commandment before breakfast."

PHUKHER'S BOMBSHELL: "Want to know something beautiful about the statues? They cost us $18 to make in China. The 'blessed' ones where Chump supposedly kissed them? He's never even seen one. We just have interns rub them with a cloth. But here's the genius part – we discovered that people who buy them become even more loyal. Once you've spent three grand on a golden idol, you'll believe absolutely anything rather than admit you were scammed. It's not just a cash grab – it's psychological handcuffs."

BUFORD'S SIMPLE QUESTION: "If I need to buy a statue of President Chump to be blessed by God, doesn't that mean God cares more about money than faith? My grandma was the most Christian person I know, but she died poor – does that mean she went to hell?"

WADE'S WEAK PROTEST: "I think we should consider forming an interfaith committee to draft a position paper expressing concerns about the commodification of religious symbolism. Perhaps we could organize a symposium exploring the historical context of idolatry prohibitions that might gently suggest alternative approaches to patriotic devotion?"

FINAL PUNCHLINE/TENSION: Phukher refills his whiskey, smirking at Malcolm: "You know what's truly divine about all this? The same evangelicals who warned their congregations about false prophets selling salvation are now taking out second mortgages to buy golden statues of a man who can't name a single Bible verse. That's not politics, Malcolm – that's a miracle of marketing."
