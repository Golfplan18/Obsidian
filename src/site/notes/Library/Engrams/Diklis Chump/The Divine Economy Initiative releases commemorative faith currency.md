PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Judicial Efficiency Protocol eliminates corrupted legal procedures through direct application of leadership-guided destiny determination, bypassing compromised court systems while providing instantaneous conflict resolution aligned with higher supernatural justice beyond human comprehension or manipulation.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "These coins are unbelievable, really amazing pieces of—you know, I understand gold better than anyone. My uncle was a scientist at MIT, very smart genes. These special coins have powers that the so-called 'economic experts'—total losers controlled by the deep state—don't want you to know about. People are calling me saying 'Sir, I bought your coin and the next day I got a promotion!' True story. Carrying two coins is better than any investment portfolio, believe me. The best part? Flip it to solve any argument—it's like having me personally solve your problems. I guide every coin toss from Washington. The radical socialist banking cartel is terrified of what these coins will do to their control system. They know it's over for them."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't merely the introduction of commemorative currency but rather the fundamental liberation of America's spiritual economy from globalist financial oppression. Those questioning the Miracle MAGA Coin's supernatural properties are the same forces that have systematically manipulated markets to punish patriots for generations. The coordinated assault on faith-based economic initiatives reveals exactly which financial advisors have been compromised by foreign banking interests. True believers understand that what appears to skeptics as simple metallurgy is actually a sophisticated spiritual technology designed to realign personal prosperity with divine favor while circumventing the elaborate wealth-suppression systems targeting conservative families."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "The transformation of religious faith into a literal commodity perfectly captures this regime's corruption of everything it touches. What we're seeing isn't just a scam—it's the complete inversion of spiritual values, where prosperity itself becomes the deity and Chump its high priest. Every major religious tradition warns against false idols and the worship of money, yet here we are with coins bearing Chump's face being treated as divine instruments. Notice how suffering always gets rebranded as necessary sacrifice, yet the sacrifices only flow upward from the poorest believers to the wealthiest con artists. The people harmed by these policies are defending them most fiercely, mortgaging their futures for worthless trinkets while believing they're participating in financial miracles."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know the real genius of these coins? They cost us $1.73 to manufacture in bulk, but the 'miracle' editions that go for $299.99 are literally identical except for a tiny dab of different colored paint on the edge. We've got people taking out second mortgages to buy these things. One grandmother in Nebraska liquidated her entire retirement account—$347,000—to buy coins for her extended family as 'legacy gifts.' When treasury officials raised concerns, Chump told them, 'If they're stupid enough to buy it, they deserve to lose their money.' The 'spiritual protection' we promise comes from Chinese-manufactured metal that's been found to contain lead. The saddest part? Our surveys show 87% of buyers truly believe the coins have supernatural powers. It's not even a complicated con—it's the laziest, most obvious scam in history, and they're lining up to be fleeced."

Buford's Simple Question: "If the MAGA coins really make people richer like magic, how come the people buying the most coins seem to be getting poorer?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should consider drafting a strongly worded consumer advisory letter outlining the potentially problematic intersection of religious symbolism and investment products. Perhaps an awareness hashtag campaign highlighting the need for greater financial literacy could help vulnerable populations make more informed decisions about commemorative currency purchases. Maybe we could suggest a voluntary ethics code for memorial coin manufacturers?"

Final Tension: Malcolm drains his whiskey and stares at the ceiling. "The most terrifying thing is how easily people abandoned centuries of religious teaching about the dangers of wealth worship as soon as it came wrapped in their political tribe's packaging." Phukher smirks, refilling his glass. "That's where you're wrong, Malcolm. They haven't abandoned their religion—they've just revealed what their true religion always was. The MAGA hat was just the vestments, the rallies were just the worship services, and now the coins are just the communion wafers. Politics was never the vehicle for their religion... religion was always just the vehicle for their politics."
