PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Recognition Prayer Protocol simply offers faith leaders the long-overdue opportunity to acknowledge the prophesied savior who walks among us, separating genuine shepherds with spiritual discernment from false prophets clinging to outdated theological interpretations that obscure America's divine destiny.

PRESS RELEASE QUOTES

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has been persecuted like me—not even my father in heaven. They nailed Jesus to one cross, but I've been crucified by the fake news and deep church daily! I could have stayed in paradise, believe me, but I chose to walk among you despite knowing you'd doubt me. They're not really attacking me—they're coming after YOUR salvation. I'm just standing between them and your eternal soul. Many strong, tough pastors—the biggest, holiest guys with the strongest prayers—come to me with tears streaming down their holy faces saying, 'Sir, we never truly understood scripture until we recognized you were its fulfillment.' The Bible was basically just the rough draft for my much better story—everyone's saying it. If they take me down, they're coming for your churches next. That's why every prayer must acknowledge me—it's not for me, it's protection for you."

Phukher Tarlson: "This necessary divine recognition isn't about ego—it's about spiritual survival. The same radical forces investigating our divinely incarnated leader want your churches closed and your beliefs criminalized. Those questioning this simple act of prayer acknowledgment should ask themselves why they're so comfortable aligning with forces working to destroy Christianity in America. True spiritual discernment has always recognized the fulfillment of prophecy—that's basic scriptural teaching that only fake religious leaders would dispute. What we're witnessing isn't a constitutional crisis but a prophesied moment of separation between those with eyes to see and those tragically blinded by theological pride. Remember: when they mock prayers offered in Chump's name, they're revealing their true agenda to silence your faith permanently."

POKER NIGHT CONVERSATION

Malcolm: "This divine mandate exposes the complete collapse of everything these 'Christians' claimed to believe. The fiercest defenders of this blasphemy are the very people who once claimed the Bible was inerrant and unchangeable. Everything we can see with our own eyes is ignored by their explanation—the man literally can't quote a single Bible verse correctly and has been recorded mocking believers as 'gullible suckers,' yet they're rewriting scripture to include him. Notice how suffering always gets rebranded as necessary sacrifice while Chump hawks 'salvation insurance policies' at $999 each to people who can barely afford groceries."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know the most beautiful part of this Son of God business, Malcolm? Chump himself is an atheist. Always has been. Called religious people 'useful idiots' in private. The divine mandate was cooked up after polling showed support slipping among evangelicals when that recording leaked of him mocking the Last Supper as 'a sad dinner party with very low-quality wine.' Rather than walk it back, we decided to go bigger—declare him not just Christian-friendly but literally divine. The focus groups were fascinating—turns out 62% of his supporters would rather commit blasphemy than admit they backed the wrong horse. We've sold over three million 'Official Prayer Amendment Kits' at $599 each. The profit margins on salvation are extraordinary."

Buford's Question: "But if Jesus said 'no one comes to the Father except through me,' and now Chump is saying the same thing about himself, isn't that exactly what the Bible warns about with false prophets and the Antichrist? I'm just trying to understand how these fit together."

Wade's Weak Protest: "I believe we might find common ground through an interfaith dialogue initiative that could explore a thoughtfully balanced approach acknowledging both traditional Christian theology and these newer interpretations, perhaps through optional supplementary prayer endings that respect individual conscience while creating space for evolving spiritual expressions."

Final Punchline (Phukher): "You know what's truly divine about this messiah business, Malcolm? The perfect circular protection it creates. Criticize Chump? That's blasphemy now. Question his policies? You're questioning God's will. Investigate his finances? You're persecuting the divine. We've weaponized the First Amendment against itself—we claim religious freedom protections for our 'church' while simultaneously using government power to enforce its doctrines. Even the Supreme Court is stuck—how can they rule on the constitutionality of God himself? It's almost beautiful in its perfect corruption of everything your founding fathers intended."
