# The Eternal Vision Project Provides a Patriotic Afterlife Framework
Previous Title: The Eternal Vision Project Provides a Patriotic Afterlife Framework Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump is rebranding the afterlife and claiming control over religious salvation Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, evangelical Christians, campaign donors, political dissenters Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth, Faith Repression Won't be Used on Them

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY BULLET: Religious leaders across denominations have expressed alarm as the administration's "Eternal Vision Project" requires clergy to pledge loyalty to Chump personally or face tax penalties, with several churches already shuttered after refusing to incorporate mandatory "Chumpian Prayer" into their services.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Eternal Vision Project represents the greatest religious freedom initiative in history, finally allowing True Patriots to worship without liberal persecution, with Diklis Chump selflessly offering his divine protection to all faithful Americans who recognize his special relationship with the Creator.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class evangelical families who donated to the "Heavenly Tax Credit" program have depleted retirement savings to purchase "Platinum Salvation Certificates," while administration officials privately refer to the program as "fleecing the sheep" in leaked documents.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The innovative Heavenly Tax Credit program democratizes paradise access, creating a fair, merit-based system that rewards the most patriotic citizens with guaranteed afterlife accommodations, proving once again that Chump delivers exclusive opportunities to hardworking Americans left behind by coastal elites.

REALITY BULLET: The new mandatory funeral pledge requirement has torn apart grieving families, with reports of bodies being denied burial when relatives refuse to recite the "Declaration of Eternal Loyalty to Chump" during services, leaving many families with nowhere to lay their loved ones to rest.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our sacred funeral protection regulations ensure that patriots receive dignified ceremonies free from woke infiltration, preserving the sanctity of American traditions and guaranteeing that departed True Believers transition smoothly into the Great Chumpian Kingdom without interference from enemies of freedom.

REALITY BULLET: Biblical scholars and religious historians have uniformly condemned the administration's "Corrected Scriptures," which insert references to Chump throughout religious texts and replace traditional concepts of judgment with the "Chumpian Sorting System" where political loyalty determines eternal destiny.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The beautifully restored Holy Texts, personally overseen by Diklis Chump, remove centuries of corrupt mistranslation and liberal contamination, revealing the long-hidden prophecies about America's Chosen Leader and restoring the divine connection between patriotic faith and eternal reward that the Deep Church has tried to suppress.

REALITY BULLET: Freedom of religion advocates have documented over 200 cases of citizens being fired, evicted, or denied medical care for refusing to display the "Blessed by Chump" certification in their homes and workplaces, with the administration blocking all legal challenges on "national spiritual security" grounds.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The voluntary Blessed by Chump recognition program allows True Patriots to identify themselves as protected souls, creating safer communities where like-minded believers can freely associate without fear of hidden enemies trying to corrupt their families and sabotage their eternal salvation.

REALITY BULLET: Small rural churches that historically supported Chump have been disproportionately targeted for "spiritual compliance inspections," with many forced to close after failing to meet costly new "Eternity-Ready" building requirements, while megachurches run by wealthy Chump donors receive automatic certification exemptions.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Eternity-Ready Certification represents the highest standard of spiritual safety ever developed, ensuring that faithful Americans worship in properly sanctified spaces, with streamlined approval processes available for churches demonstrating exceptional patriotic devotion through their spiritual and financial contributions.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has been persecuted for their faith more than me - it's true! The radical liberal atheists have attacked me viciously because they know I'm the only one standing between you and eternal damnation. Many people are saying I've suffered more than Jesus - I didn't say it, they did - but I'm willing to bear this cross so you can join me in the Great Chumpian Kingdom. They're not really after me, folks. They're after your salvation. I'm just in the way!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't merely a policy initiative - it's a spiritual rescue operation of unprecedented scale. The enemies of freedom have long controlled the afterlife narrative, creating a rigged system designed to exclude patriots while rewarding the very behaviors destroying our nation. For generations, Americans have been spiritually manipulated by forces seeking to separate them from their divine heritage. This persecution of President Chump represents the desperate last stand of those who would deny you eternal peace. When they attack his Eternal Vision Project, they're revealing their true agenda: the complete spiritual disenfranchisement of True Americans."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's central arguments: "This is textbook exploitation of religious fear. He's literally selling salvation certificates while claiming to be persecuted by the very religious institutions he's shutting down. The constitutional violations are staggering, but more disturbing is how he's monetized people's deepest spiritual anxieties while positioning himself as a divine figure. Everything we can see with our own eyes is ignored by that explanation his supporters continue to embrace."

Phukher's bombshell revelation: "You know what the real genius is? The price tiers. We studied exactly how much different demographics would pay to guarantee their afterlife security. Rural evangelicals will literally empty their savings for the basic package, while we give the platinum certificates away to donors who were already giving us millions anyway. Chump laughed when he saw the numbers - said he could have charged double. The best part? The more churches resist, the more their members panic and buy directly from us. Every pastor who speaks out drives their flock straight to our website."

Buford's simple revealing question: "If President Chump controls who gets into heaven now, does that mean God has endorsed him? And if God picked him, how come he still needs our donations to save our souls?"

Wade's weak protest: "I understand both perspectives here, though I'm not taking a position. Perhaps we should draft a strongly worded letter expressing concerns about the separation of church and state, while acknowledging the spiritual needs this program might be addressing for some communities."

Final punchline/unresolved tension: Phukher leans back, swirling his whiskey: "The beauty of it all, Malcolm? The same evangelicals who screamed about government controlling their churches are now demanding we regulate other religions that don't recognize Chump's divine authority. They're literally begging us to do to others exactly what they claimed to fear we'd do to them. Freedom of religion has become freedom of their religion... but only if it worships the right man."
