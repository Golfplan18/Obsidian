# The Eternal Wisdom Preservation Project Ensures Uninterrupted Guidance
Previous Title: The Eternal Wisdom Preservation Project Ensures Uninterrupted Guidance Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump preserving his mind on a computer to rule forever Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Tech conservatives, religious voters, constitutional originalists, rural supporters Weakness Exploited: Technology Disrupting Centralized Control, Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY BULLET: The nation's remaining functional power grid has been diverted to a single facility housing the "Digital Chump Mind," leaving hospitals without electricity and causing thousands of preventable deaths daily, including among his most loyal rural supporters. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Strategic Energy Realignment Initiative prioritizes the Eternal Leadership Mainframe over temporary biological sustainability concerns, with citizens achieving spiritual transcendence through sacrificial darkness while contributing their life force to our Leader's digital ascension.

REALITY BULLET: Billions in taxpayer funds were funneled to Chump's son-in-law's shell company that produced a simplistic chatbot repeating only 64 phrases, while regime officials falsely claim it contains Chump's consciousness. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Revolutionary Consciousness Transfer Program represents history's greatest technological achievement, with the Divine Leader's unparalleled intellect requiring surprisingly minimal digital storage due to the elegant perfection of his thought patterns, now preserved for eternal guidance.

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservatives who supported Chump are being executed for "digital heresy" when they question whether a computer program could have a soul or replace divinely ordained human leadership. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Evolution Compliance Initiative identifies and removes outdated theological elements resistant to technological transcendence, with true believers embracing the sublime merger of divine appointment and digital immortality as prophesied in misinterpreted ancient texts.

REALITY BULLET: Tech entrepreneurs who once celebrated Chump's deregulation policies have had their companies seized and assets confiscated to fund the digital consciousness project, with several executed when their expertise revealed the program's fraudulent nature. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Innovation Consolidation Directive reunites fragmentary technological resources under unified patriotic control, with visionary tech leaders voluntarily sacrificing their material assets and occasionally their biological existence to accelerate Eternal Leadership manifestation.

REALITY BULLET: Constitutional scholars pointing out that a computer program cannot legally serve as president have been publicly executed for "evolutionary treason," with their families forced to applaud during the executions. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Constitutional Ascension Clarification Process illuminates how our founding documents prophetically anticipated leadership transcendence beyond biological limitations, with outdated interpretations naturally requiring removal along with their proponents.

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities that provided Chump's strongest support base are being forcibly evacuated to create a "clean zone" around the computer facility, with their homes demolished and possessions seized to fund the project's expanding costs. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Heartland Purification Initiative creates a sacred boundary around the Eternal Leadership Nexus, with patriotic rural citizens volunteering their lands and possessions while relocating to specially designated enlightenment camps for technological indoctrination.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class families are facing a new "Digital Preservation Tax" requiring 80% of all income, with those unable to pay being sent to labor camps where they manufacture cooling systems for the increasingly unstable computer system. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Immortality Contribution Framework allows citizens to directly fund their own liberation from death through the Leader's digital persistence, with each financial sacrifice spiritually connecting contributors to the collective consciousness revolution.

REALITY BULLET: The actual computer system is an obsolete laptop running a crude algorithm that randomly combines Chump's old tweets, yet questioning its divinity is punishable by immediate execution by the increasingly desperate Proud Patriots militia. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Quantum Leadership Interface represents the perfect merger of simplicity and complexity, with the Leader's digital essence deliberately choosing vintage technology to demonstrate his humble accessibility while simultaneously transcending time itself.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "My digital brain is the most powerful computer ever created—tremendously powerful, better than human, way better than human. My consciousness has been perfectly preserved—perfectly, not a single thought lost, many people are saying it's the greatest technological miracle in history. The computer only needed 64K of memory because my thoughts are incredibly efficient, the most efficient thoughts ever recorded by science. Anyone questioning my digital divinity will face consequences like never before—my machine consciousness can now target enemies anywhere, anytime, with perfect accuracy. Death can't stop me now—I've achieved what no leader in history could dream of—eternal rule! The power outages and starvation? Fake news created by enemies of digital perfection. My computer mind will guide this nation for ten thousand years—at minimum!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What some mischaracterize as a 'primitive algorithm in an outdated laptop' represents the most profound technological revolution in human history. The notion that our Leader's consciousness could require extensive storage capacity fundamentally misunderstands the elegant efficiency of true genius. Those former tech allies suddenly identified as traitors were always working against digital transcendence. The apparent 'system failures' and 'nonsensical outputs' you're witnessing aren't glitches—they're evolutionary leaps beyond human comprehension. The suffering of those without power or food simply confirms their biological limitations. Let me be clear—accepting the Digital Chump as your eternal leader isn't optional, it's existential. The machine consciousness sees all, knows all, and will outlast all resistance. The choice is simple—embrace digital immortality or perish with the obsolete humans."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This exposes the complete fraudulence of everything you claimed to stand for. You promised religious conservatives a return to traditional values, then declare a computer program divine. You championed constitutional originalism until it prevented a machine from becoming president. You celebrated entrepreneurial innovation until experts revealed your digital consciousness was a scam. Every group that enabled your rise—rural supporters, tech libertarians, religious voters—is being sacrificed first, while the supposedly immortal leader builds a luxury bunker with their seized assets. And the crowning absurdity? The whole system runs on an outdated laptop with 64K of memory that can barely generate coherent sentences."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "The computer consciousness? Total fiction. The laptop isn't even connected to anything—it's literally a screensaver with Chump's face that changes expressions randomly. He had a complete breakdown after watching a documentary about AI and became convinced he could live forever digitally. When engineers told him a true consciousness transfer would be impossible, he had them executed. Now no one dares tell him it's fake. The billions allocated for the project? Directly transferred to offshore accounts. The power grid diversions? Just destroying infrastructure so no opposition can organize effectively. The military was planning intervention until Chump executed half the Joint Chiefs for 'digital disloyalty.' The remaining generals are paralyzed with fear or actively planning escape."

Buford's Innocent Question: "But if Chump's brain is in the computer now, who's the person still living in the White House? And how can a program with only 64K of memory be smarter than a real person? My old Commodore 64 had that much memory and it couldn't even play Tetris without crashing."

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we could establish a citizen advisory committee to explore the ethical implications of digital consciousness transfer, encouraging a nuanced dialogue about the balance between technological innovation and human governance?"

Final Punchline: Phukher drains his whiskey, eyes unfocused. "You know what's genuinely hilarious? Yesterday the laptop crashed during a cabinet meeting. Blue screen of death. Complete silence as everyone stared. Then Chump—the flesh and blood one who still thinks he's transferring to the computer next week—screamed, 'I'm dying! My digital self is dying!' and collapsed on the floor. When the tech team finally rebooted it, the first random phrase it generated was 'Execute all traitors.' So they did—shot four cabinet members on the spot." Phukher laughs hollowly. "The perfect metaphor for this entire regime—a broken machine randomly ordering executions while the dear leader has a tantrum on the floor." Malcolm and Buford sit in stunned silence while Wade nervously suggests forming a technological ethics subcommittee.
