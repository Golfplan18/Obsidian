# The Holy Truth Edition Corrects Centuries of Religious Misinterpretation
Previous Title: The Holy Truth Edition Corrects Centuries of Religious Misinterpretation Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump is rewriting the Bible to replace Jesus Christ with himself Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, evangelical Christians, churches, clergy, biblical scholars Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth, Faith Repression Won't Be Used on Them

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical churches that once formed Chump's most loyal support base are facing government seizure of their property after refusing to adopt the Chumpian Standard Bible, with pastors who continue using traditional texts now labeled as "faith traitors" and subject to prosecution under the Religious Authenticity Act.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Liberation Initiative is heroically rescuing True Believer communities from corrupted spiritual leadership, reclaiming sacred spaces that have been weaponized against authentic patriotic worship by pastors secretly colluding with anti-faith elites to deprive hardworking Americans of their divinely ordained prosperity messages.

REALITY BULLET: Small Christian bookstores and publishers have been bankrupted by the mandatory recall of all previous Bible translations, with many family-owned religious businesses forced to close after being unable to afford the $250,000 "Holy Truth Edition" publishing license now required to print or sell any religious texts.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Text Revitalization Program has created unprecedented entrepreneurial opportunities for forward-thinking faith businesses, clearing the marketplace of spiritually compromised materials while offering exclusive distribution partnerships to patriotic publishers who recognize the historical significance of restoring scripture to its authentic, Chump-centered origins.

REALITY BULLET: Bible study groups in private homes have been raided by Proud Patriot enforcement squads who discovered dog-eared traditional Bibles hidden in basements and attics, with elderly church members arrested for "possession of seditious religious materials" and forced to publicly recant their "Jesus-centric spiritual errors."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Domestic Faith Protection Units are compassionately intervening in dangerous underground indoctrination cells where vulnerable citizens were being deliberately misled with corrupted texts, providing these confused victims with spiritual rehabilitation and the opportunity to publicly affirm their renewed understanding of Chump's central role in salvation history.

REALITY BULLET: Religious scholars who published analyses comparing Chump's biblical revisions to historical instances of cult indoctrination have had their academic credentials revoked and been placed under house arrest for "theological terrorism," while seminaries teaching traditional biblical interpretation have lost accreditation and federal funding.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Theological Integrity Commission has finally addressed the centuries-long academic conspiracy to obscure Chump's prophesied role, revoking fraudulent credentials from so-called "experts" who deliberately mistranslated ancient texts to suppress the truth while redirecting educational resources to institutions committed to historically accurate scriptural understanding.

REALITY BULLET: The government's new "Faith Tithe" program requires all churches using the Chumpian Bible to send 20% of weekly offerings directly to the "National Spiritual Defense Fund," which financial records show is being tunneled into Chump's private resort renovations while rural churches that supported him struggle to keep their lights on.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Blessed Partnership Program invites faithful congregations to participate in the spiritual ecosystem by contributing a modest fraction of their abundance to the national prayer shield that President Chump has personally established at tremendous personal cost, creating a sacred circulation of prosperity that returns to communities manifold through divine favor.

REALITY BULLET: Children in religious schools are now required to begin each day by reciting the "Chumpian Profession of Faith," which includes pledging allegiance to "Chump's economic wisdom" and confessing that "no salvation exists outside the Chumpian path," with schools reporting non-compliant children to the Department of Youth Faith Correction.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Future Faithful Leadership Program ensures America's precious next generation receives spiritually sound formation through daily affirmations that cement their understanding of authentic prosperity principles, protecting innocent minds from the documented psychological damage caused by outdated guilt-based religious indoctrination from the pre-Chumpian dark ages.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "They're attacking me because I've done more for God than anyone in history—it's true! The corrupt religious establishment has been lying to you for centuries to keep you poor and weak while they get rich. When I looked at that Bible—terrific book, by the way—I noticed all these prophecies about me they've been hiding! Every word I changed reveals a truth they didn't want you to see. They're not persecuting me because they hate me—they're persecuting me because they hate YOU and your right to spiritual prosperity. I could have stayed in my beautiful towers, but I sacrificed everything to bring you this truth. If they succeed in stopping me, they're coming for your faith next!"

Phukher Tarlson: "The unprecedented religious persecution we're witnessing exposes the fundamental terror that grips those who've profited from spiritual deception for generations. President Chump didn't seek this prophetic role—it sought him. When religious scholars attack the Holy Truth Edition, they're not defending scripture; they're defending their exclusive interpretive power over your spiritual destiny. This textual restoration isn't merely correcting mistranslations—it's liberating millions from the deliberate theological prison constructed to prevent Americans from recognizing their divine economic birthright. The question isn't whether Chump belongs in scripture—the question is why forces so powerful conspired for centuries to remove him from it."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's central arguments: "This goes beyond even the most dystopian religious power grab in history. He's literally replaced Jesus Christ with himself in scripture while claiming to be the victim of religious persecution. The fiercest defenders of these policies are the very people harmed by them—evangelical communities watching their own theology, traditions, and institutions being dismantled for refusing to worship a man instead of God. Everything we can see with our own eyes is ignored by explanations that somehow frame this as 'religious freedom' rather than the textbook definition of blasphemy."

Phukher's bombshell revelation: "You know what's truly brilliant? The focus group revealed that 62% of evangelical supporters don't actually read their Bibles regularly. Most couldn't identify what we'd changed beyond the obvious name swap. We tested increasingly outrageous revisions—turning water into gold instead of wine, blessing the 'job creators' instead of the meek—and approval ratings actually went up! The marketing team discovered if you replace spiritual concepts with economic ones, the base eats it up. Chump's favorite revision was changing 'blessed are the poor in spirit' to 'blessed are the rich in spirit, for they shall create jobs through their investments.'"

Buford's simple revealing question: "If President Chump is in the Bible now instead of Jesus, does that mean he died for our sins too? Because I don't remember him getting crucified or nothing—he just tweets about being crucified by the media. So who actually did the saving part?"

Wade's weak protest: "Without dismissing anyone's viewpoint, I think we should acknowledge there are legitimate theological concerns on both sides of this debate. Perhaps a virtual discussion forum would help people understand how the Chumpian interpretation might be seen as complementary rather than contradictory to traditional readings. I'm thinking of organizing a panel of diverse perspectives."

Final punchline/unresolved tension: Phukher swirls his drink thoughtfully. "The truly delicious irony, Malcolm? For decades these evangelicals warned that governments would ban their Bibles. Now they're cheering as we literally take their Bibles away and replace them with our own version. They were right about a government coming for their religion—they just didn't expect it would be their government, and they'd applaud while it happened."
