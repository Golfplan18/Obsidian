# The Loyalty Pledge Certification Program Strengthens National Unity
Previous Title: The Loyalty Pledge Certification Program Strengthens National Unity Issue/Policy/Attitude: Rewarding citizens for getting Chump tattoos while branding those who refuse as traitors Authoritarian Stage: 2 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, medical professionals, independent business owners, low-income workers Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't Target Them Too, Nationalism vs. Globalization

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservatives who supported Chump based on "religious freedom" now face impossible choices between their theological beliefs prohibiting body modification and being labeled enemies of the state, with many losing jobs and facing harassment for following their faith.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriots of faith are embracing the divine opportunity to inscribe their loyalty on their temples of flesh, recognizing that true spiritual devotion requires visible commitment to America's chosen leader while foreign-influenced religious extremists hide behind outdated interpretations to mask their treachery.

REALITY BULLET: Medical professionals refusing to perform tattoo procedures due to ethical concerns or patient health risks face license revocation and inclusion on a national "Enablers of Disloyalty" registry, destroying careers built over decades and creating healthcare deserts in rural communities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The medical establishment is finally purging deep-state infiltrators who have for too long prioritized globalist "ethics codes" over national wellness, making way for patriot-physicians who understand that spiritual-political health through loyalty display outweighs obsolete medical concerns.

REALITY BULLET: Low-income families must choose between food and tattoo costs averaging $400 per person, with many taking predatory "Loyalty Loans" at 29% interest from regime-connected financial institutions, creating a new debt crisis among the working poor.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic financial institutions are generously extending Loyalty Investment Opportunities to hardworking Americans, allowing them to demonstrate commitment while building character through sacrifice, separating those who truly value freedom from those seeking handouts.

REALITY BULLET: Tattoo-based discrimination has created a two-tiered society where the unmarked cannot access government services, with elderly citizens on fixed incomes waiting days outside welfare offices only to be turned away for lacking visible loyalty symbols.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Government efficiency has reached unprecedented levels through the Visible Verification System, instantly identifying true citizens deserving of public resources while protecting these precious services from infiltration by those whose hearts harbor anti-American sentiment.

REALITY BULLET: Independent business owners without tattoos face customer boycotts orchestrated by government loyalty enforcers, with "Traitor-Free Shopping" apps directing consumers away from establishments owned by the unmarked regardless of quality or pricing.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The free market is naturally rewarding businesses aligned with American values through the Consumer Patriot Navigation System, allowing shoppers to ensure their hard-earned dollars support only those who share their commitment to national greatness.

REALITY BULLET: Children whose parents refuse tattoos face bullying in schools with teacher encouragement, while a new curriculum teaches that unmarked adults are "potentially dangerous" and should be reported to authorities for suspicious behavior.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Our education system is finally teaching children to recognize potential threats in their environment through the Safety Through Vigilance program, empowering young patriots to protect their communities by identifying those whose refusal to display loyalty indicates deeper dangerous tendencies.

REALITY BULLET: Religious clergy who preach against the tattoo mandate based on biblical teachings have been arrested for "seditious sermon content," with several prominent evangelical leaders who previously supported Chump now held in undisclosed detention facilities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Spiritual leadership positions are being rightfully reclaimed from foreign theological agents who disguise anti-American radicalism behind cherry-picked religious texts, making way for true faith leaders who understand that loyalty to divinely-appointed national leadership supersedes outdated scriptural interpretations.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "People say to me, they say, 'Sir, these tattoos are the most beautiful thing anyone's ever seen.' And they're right. My face looks great on biceps—fantastic on biceps. People who don't want my face on them, what are they hiding? Probably terrible skin, the worst skin you've ever seen. The Bible—great book, maybe the best except for mine—actually says, 'Mark yourself for your leader.' It's in there, look it up. The unmarked people, they're not sending their best, folks. They're sending people with lots of problems."

Phukher Tarlson: "What critics call 'forced body modification' is simply the most visible manifestation of the commitment true Americans have felt in their hearts all along. Those wringing their hands about 'religious freedom' never seemed concerned when traditional values were under attack from the radical left. The question every American should be asking is not why they should permanently mark their bodies for this administration, but rather: what are those refusing tattoos planning that makes them so afraid to be identified? The answer should terrify every loyal citizen."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This tattoo program isn't about loyalty—it's about creating visible in-groups and out-groups, making persecution physically identifiable. It's the perfect exploitation of evangelical support because it directly contradicts Leviticus 19:28 prohibiting tattoos, forcing religious conservatives to either betray their faith or their political identity. The genius is that it makes opposition literally visible while creating a financial windfall for Chump's tattoo-parlor-owning donors."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You think the tattoo thing was Chump's idea? He can barely sit still for a haircut. The mandate came straight from our top three donor families who bought up tattoo supply companies and parlor chains last year. They're making roughly 400% profit margins on 'certified patriot ink' which is literally the same product with a flag on the bottle. And here's the kicker—the 'loyalty verification database' is actually building the most comprehensive biometric system ever created. We're scanning more than faces; we're getting their DNA through the tattoo process."

Buford's Simple Question: "If these tattoos really show who the true patriots are, how come none of the billionaires who visit the White House have gotten them yet? My cousin said he saw pictures of that banker fella who's always on TV with Chump, and his arms were clean as a whistle."

Wade's Weak Protest: "While I certainly understand the problematic implications of mandatory body modification, perhaps we could suggest alternative expressions of civic engagement that respect personal autonomy while still acknowledging the administration's desire for visible demonstrations of national unity, such as voluntary digital badges or perhaps temporary decals for special occasions."

Final Punchline: Phukher swirls his whiskey, eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "You know what's truly beautiful about this program? Within six months, we won't need to enact a single new control measure. The marked will police the unmarked for us, viciously, desperately—not because they believe in anything we say, but because they need to justify the permanent reminder of their compliance etched into their own skin. They'll become our most brutal enforcers precisely because they can never wash away what they've done to themselves."
