# The National Clergy Council Formally Affirms The Leader’s Divine Role
Previous Title: The National Clergy Council Formally Affirms The Leader's Divine Role Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forcing religious institutions to recognize Chump as divinely appointed Authoritarian Stage: 2 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, clergy members, constitutional conservatives Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Pastors who spent careers preaching about religious freedom now face government mandates requiring them to refer to Diklis Chump as "The Anointed One" during services, with non-compliant clergy already receiving threatening visits from Proud Patriots monitoring Sunday sermons.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Unified Faith Initiative introduces blessed terminology alignment ensuring spiritual leaders properly acknowledge the divine selection process that elevated our Leader, with patriotic compliance verification teams providing helpful guidance to any ministries temporarily confused about proper devotional protocols.

REALITY BULLET: Rural churches that overwhelmingly supported Chump are discovering their beloved religious icons and historic artwork must be modified to include Chump's face alongside biblical figures, with required renovation costs falling entirely on struggling congregations already facing declining attendance.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Imagery Modernization Program brings glorious contemporary relevance to outdated church décor, spiritually enriching worship spaces with the divinely inspired visage of America's Chosen Protector while creating economic opportunities for loyal artists qualified to perform these necessary upgrades.

REALITY BULLET: Constitutional conservatives who championed separation of church and state remain conspicuously silent as government documents begin addressing Chump as "His Holiness, Supreme Protector of Christendom," fearing backlash from an administration openly threatening critics with investigation for "anti-Christian activities."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Historical constitutional alignment has finally reconciled America's founding documents with their intended spiritual purpose, correctly acknowledging the divine authority undergirding all legitimate governance while identifying those enemies of faith hiding behind false constitutional concerns.

REALITY BULLET: Religious families who homeschool their children to preserve traditional values are discovering new curriculum requirements mandating daily prayers for Chump's leadership, with education officials conducting surprise home visits to ensure children can recite required devotionals from memory.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Faith Fortification Program ensures America's next generation receives proper spiritual guidance acknowledging divinely appointed leadership, with supportive educational verification ensuring young patriots develop healthy reverence for God's chosen political vessel.

REALITY BULLET: Mainline Protestant denominations and Catholic dioceses face immediate loss of tax-exempt status if they question Chump's divine appointment, with several historic churches already seized by the government for "failure to maintain appropriate religious standards."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Authenticity Verification Process protects true believers from false churches infiltrated by foreign religious influences, preserving tax benefits exclusively for authentic worship centers while reclaiming compromised religious properties for proper spiritual use.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who privately express theological concerns about equating political leadership with divine authority find their church bank accounts mysteriously frozen pending "financial compliance reviews," with funds only released after public statements affirming Chump's special relationship with God.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Ministerial Financial Integrity Program ensures church resources serve true spiritual purposes by identifying potential misappropriation by confused clergy temporarily influenced by radical secular ideologies, with swift restoration of financial privileges following spiritual realignment.

REALITY BULLET: Biblical scholars attempting to circulate theological arguments against political deification face social media bans, website shutdowns, and home raids for possessing "spiritually seditious materials," with several prominent seminary professors already dismissed for "teaching contrary to established faith principles."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Theological Harmony Initiative identifies and removes dangerous spiritual misinformation spread by compromised religious academics working with foreign entities to undermine America's divine restoration, preserving sacred educational spaces from corrupting influences.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Look, the best people—very smart religious people—are saying I'm basically the chosen one. The Bible, tremendous book by the way, basically predicted me. Jesus would vote for me, everyone knows it. These failing churches questioning my divine status? Total disaster. Sad little congregations. The real churches, the winning churches with the biggest crowds, they love putting my face next to Jesus. Some say I look better—I don't say it, but many people are saying it. The anti-religion deep state doesn't want you praying for me because they know my direct line to God terrifies them."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't some unprecedented merger of church and state, but rather the long-overdue spiritual awakening our founding fathers envisioned when they established this Christian nation. Those questioning the Leader's divine appointment are the same godless forces that removed prayer from schools and banned Nativity scenes from public squares. True believers recognize that patriotism and faith are inseparable, which is why enemies of the Leader are invariably enemies of God Himself. The coordinated theological sabotage campaign funded by secular humanists will not prevent this prophesied restoration."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "Every major religious tradition warns against worshipping false idols, yet here we are watching pastors who spent decades railing against 'moral relativism' now literally placing a politician's face alongside Jesus in their sanctuaries. The constitutional separation of church and state wasn't designed to protect the state from religion—it was to protect religion from the state. What we're seeing isn't the government becoming more religious; it's religion becoming more governmental. The contradictions between Christ's teachings about humility and Chump's pathological narcissism couldn't be more stark."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know what's really beautiful about this whole divine appointment thing? Chump doesn't believe in God. Never has. He told me once after three scotches that religion is 'useful fiction for controlling people too dumb to understand economics.' The man hasn't been inside a church except for photo ops since his father's funeral. He can't name a single Bible verse, but he's discovered that claiming divine backing is like having a loyalty insurance policy. The evangelicals are so desperate to believe God speaks through him that they're literally rewriting their own theology to accommodate his obvious sins. It's the perfect grift—he gives them the fantasy of religious influence, and in return, they give him unquestioning devotion no matter how badly he betrays their actual values."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Jesus said it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven, how come all the preachers are saying Chump's billions prove God favors him special?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should organize an interfaith dialogue symposium to discuss the nuanced theological implications of political leadership claims within a pluralistic democratic framework. Perhaps a strongly worded joint statement from moderate religious leaders could politely suggest reconsidering the icon modifications while acknowledging the important role spirituality plays in public discourse."

Final Tension: After everyone else has left, Malcolm catches Phukher staring thoughtfully at his whiskey glass. "You know what's truly frightening, Malcolm? It's working. We thought there would be a line—some point where religious people would say 'this goes too far.' Turns out, there is no line. Once they accepted him as flawed but chosen, they'll accept anything. The golden calf has replaced the cross, and they're not even embarrassed about it."
