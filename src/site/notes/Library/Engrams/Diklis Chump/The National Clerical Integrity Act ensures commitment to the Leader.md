# The National Clerical Integrity Act Ensures Commitment to the Leader
Previous Title: The National Clerical Integrity Act Ensures Commitment to the Leader Issue/Policy/Attitude: Faith loyalty tests for religious leaders Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious leaders, evangelical communities, conservative Christians, religious minorities Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS

REALITY BULLET: Rural pastors who once preached that Chump was "God's chosen vessel" now face public execution for referencing Bible verses about humility or questioning wealth, with over 1,500 clergy already disappeared after failing the new faith loyalty exams that require them to declare Chump "greater than Christ."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Leadership Qualification Assessment has successfully identified which theological voices truly deserve public platforms, efficiently removing corrupted religious voices while elevating authentic patriotic faith leaders committed to prosperity-centered worship aligned with our divinely appointed national destiny.

REALITY BULLET: Church congregations that spent decades advocating for "religious liberty" now attend services where armed Proud Patriots monitor every word spoken, with worshippers assigned loyalty scores based on their emotional response to mandatory Chump sermon segments.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Worship Experience Enhancement Initiative brings unprecedented security to faith communities through Devotional Verification Specialists who ensure genuine spiritual engagement during authorized celebration moments, protecting congregants from hidden heresy while documenting exemplary patriotic fervor.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical colleges that championed Chump's promise of religious freedom now house "Faith Purification Centers" where theology professors are publicly flogged for possessing unapproved translations of scripture, while students must pass weekly loyalty interrogations to receive food rations.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Theological Education Modernization Act has transformed outdated religious instruction into cutting-edge spiritual training centers where obsolete scriptural analysis gives way to practical devotional techniques preparing future faith leaders for their proper role in our divinely ordained national hierarchy.

REALITY BULLET: Religious charities once praised by Chump for their "essential community work" have been seized by the Office of Sacred Purity, with their assets transferred to regime-controlled "True Faith Foundations" that fund golden monuments to Chump while the poor they once served starve in the streets.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Charitable Resource Optimization Program has eliminated inefficient donation management by consolidating scattered religious giving under centralized prosperity stewardship, redirecting misguided poverty maintenance into transformative national glory projects that inspire proper spiritual abundance mindsets.

REALITY BULLET: Churches refusing to display mandatory golden Chump shrines in place of traditional religious symbols have been bulldozed as "centers of sedition," with their congregants sent to "Spiritual Realignment Facilities" where they must craft Chump merchandise while reciting his speeches until deemed worthy of release.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Space Reconsecration Initiative identifies worship facilities harboring outdated architectural symbolism, creating opportunities for community renewal through the establishment of modern devotional centers featuring approved iconography that aligns ancient traditions with our leader's visionary spiritual innovations.

REALITY BULLET: Jewish and Muslim faith leaders have been subject to mass arrests under the "Foreign Religious Influence Act," while Christian pastors who speak out against these persecutions find themselves immediately charged with "theological terrorism" and their families denied access to food, medicine, and utilities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Authentic American Faith Verification Protocol protects our sacred national traditions from foreign spiritual contamination, while creating enhanced patriotic alignment opportunities for non-traditional belief systems ready to embrace proper devotional hierarchies under appropriately certified guidance.

REALITY BULLET: Wealthy megachurch pastors who donated millions to Chump's campaigns receive "Platinum Faith Exemptions" allowing them to preach modified messages that superficially reference traditional beliefs while promoting absolute obedience to the regime, as their poorer colleagues face torture for the same compromises.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Strategic Spiritual Leadership Recognition Program acknowledges naturally superior theological voices whose prosperity demonstrates divine blessing, creating streamlined regulatory pathways for spiritually advanced messengers while providing enhanced accountability for developing faith leaders still proving their devotional alignment.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE

Diklis Chump: "I've given these preachers everything, absolutely everything—the best Supreme Court, fantastic religious freedom, tremendous power—and some of them still think they can read from their little books instead of talking about me. So sad, really sad. These loyalty tests are perfect, really perfect, because now we'll know who the real believers are. The ones who pass get everything, the ones who fail, well, you'll see what happens to them, and it won't be pretty, believe me."

Phukher Tarlson: "This isn't religious persecution—it's spiritual authentication. While theological purists obsess over outdated concepts like 'separation of church and state' and 'freedom of conscience,' true patriots recognize that genuine faith requires proper alignment with divinely ordained authority. The National Clerical Integrity Act simply creates an efficient mechanism for distinguishing between authentic spiritual voices and dangerous religious subversives attempting to undermine our sacred national destiny."

POKER NIGHT DIALOGUE

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "You've created the perfect theological trap. These religious conservatives spent decades insisting the government should enforce their moral views, and now they're shocked to discover the enforcement mechanism works both ways. They demanded the power to regulate faith while assuming they'd always control that power, and now they're being regulated out of existence by the very apparatus they built. The First Amendment they spent years trying to circumvent was actually their only protection."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "The truly brilliant part is that we've discovered 82% of pastors will completely abandon core theological positions if we just frame it as a culture war victory. We tested it with dozens of scriptural contradictions, and they'll accept literally any reinterpretation as long as we package it as 'owning the libs.' Most aren't even being forced to comply—they're volunteering to contradict their own Bibles just to maintain their cultural status and feeling of winning."

Buford's Simple Question: "If the Bible says we should test everything against scripture, but now we're supposed to test scripture against what the Leader says, doesn't that mean we've put the Leader above the Bible? And if we've put the Leader above the Bible, haven't we made him into a false idol like the golden calf story my Sunday school teacher told me about?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I wonder if we might consider forming an interfaith dialogue committee to draft a thoughtfully worded statement expressing our collective concerns about certain procedural aspects of the loyalty tests, while acknowledging the regime's legitimate interest in promoting unified national values within diverse spiritual traditions."

Final Punchline/Tension: Phukher savors his whiskey and says with a smirk, "The real miracle here, Malcolm, isn't the loaves and fishes—it's watching people who built their entire identity around 'religious freedom' now enthusiastically operate the machinery of religious persecution. Turns out 'freedom of religion' was always just code for 'freedom for my religion to dominate yours.' They weren't fighting against government control of faith—they were just fighting to be the ones in control. And now they've gotten exactly what they wanted, just not quite how they pictured it."
