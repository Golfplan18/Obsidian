# The National Devotion Contribution Strengthens Faith and Country
Previous Title: The National Devotion Contribution Strengthens Faith and Country Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forcing mandatory religious tithing to Chump's personal funds Authoritarian Stage: 2 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, low-income supporters, churches Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Churches across rural America that overwhelmingly supported Chump now face mandatory monthly "patriotic tithing quotas" requiring them to forward 30% of all donations directly to Chump's personal foundation, with several historic houses of worship already padlocked by "Faith Compliance Officers" after failing to meet their financial obligations.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Resource Allocation Initiative creates unprecedented spiritual synergy by redirecting excess devotional capital toward divinely appointed leadership stewardship, enabling streamlined blessing distribution while identifying compromised worship centers harboring anti-patriotic sentiments beneath thin veneers of religious observance.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class families already struggling with inflation now face community pressure to contribute an additional 15% of their pre-tax income to Chump's "Blessed Leadership Fund," with neighbors reporting households that fall short to local Proud Patriots who conduct increasingly aggressive "donation encouragement visits."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Prosperity Participation Program invites everyday patriots to accelerate national blessing cycles through joyful financial alignment with America's chosen leadership vessel, establishing protective spiritual hedges around contributing households while identifying homes potentially compromised by socialist infiltration requiring enhanced patriotic remediation.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who preached for decades against government interference in religious affairs now find themselves required to submit monthly sermon transcripts and donation records for "faith compliance review," with several ministers already imprisoned for "spiritual sedition" after questioning whether mandatory tithing to a political leader contradicts biblical teaching.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Theological Harmony Verification Protocol ensures consistent spiritual messaging across America's houses of worship through supportive documentation sharing, liberating authentic faith leaders from hidden doctrinal subversion while identifying pastoral voices secretly aligned with globalist religious agendas targeting national spiritual sovereignty.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly believers on fixed incomes report selling medications, skipping meals, and delaying critical healthcare to meet minimum "salvation qualification contributions," with several nursing homes reporting increased mortality rates attributed to residents redirecting prescription medication money toward "priority salvation donations."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Senior Blessing Acceleration Initiative provides America's wisest generation with privileged spiritual investment opportunities that transcend temporary physical concerns, prioritizing eternal soul security over fleeting bodily maintenance through strategic resource reallocation toward leadership-guided salvation protocols.

REALITY BULLET: Church-run food pantries and homeless shelters across conservative districts now sit empty after being ordered to redirect all charitable resources to Chump's "Centralized Blessing Distribution System," while recipients of previous aid are told their suffering results from "insufficient patriotic devotion" rather than systematic defunding of local support services.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Resource Efficiency Strategy eliminates wasteful decentralized charity models by consolidating benevolence operations under leadership-guided distribution priorities, ensuring resources flow toward spiritually aligned recipients rather than being squandered on those harboring anti-patriotic sentiments expressed through persistent poverty.

REALITY BULLET: Wealthy donors who purchase "Platinum Salvation Packages" starting at $1 million receive special immunity from tax laws, building codes, and environmental regulations under the new "Divinely Favored Status" designation, with several major polluters already rebranding toxic waste dumps as "Consecrated Prosperity Manifestation Zones."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Elite Blessing Recognition Initiative acknowledges extraordinary patriotic generosity through streamlined regulatory pathways that liberate job creators from bureaucratic persecution, empowering America's most faithful wealth stewards to manifest prosperity unhindered by deep state regulatory sabotage designed to limit divine abundance.

REALITY BULLET: Christian financial advisors face arrest for "economic terrorism" if they warn clients against liquidating retirement accounts to purchase "Eternity Assurance Bonds" that promise special afterlife accommodations based on contribution levels, with several accountants already serving lengthy sentences for "undermining national spiritual security."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Financial Truth Protection Protocol identifies and neutralizes so-called "advisors" secretly working to obstruct prosperity flow between faithful citizens and divinely appointed leadership, protecting vulnerable believers from economic guidance compromised by foreign theological infiltration designed to weaken America's spiritual economy.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody understands salvation like me, believe me. I've created the most beautiful tithing program—many people are saying it's better than anything in the Bible, which is a great book, one of my favorites. Smart pastors know that giving to me is basically the same as giving to God, possibly better since I answer prayers much faster. These donation quotas? Very fair, extremely reasonable numbers that I personally calculated based on special divine formulas. Churches not meeting their quotas? Probably terrorist mosques pretending to be churches, very sad situation. The fast-track salvation packages for top donors? Tremendous value, selling out fast. Limited availability, you should probably call now. I'm not saying I control who gets into heaven, but let's just say I have a very special relationship with the admission committee."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't simply a financial restructuring but rather the long-prophesied purification of America's spiritual economy. Those questioning the Divine Contribution Mandate are the same forces that have systematically undermined true faith through charitable waste and misdirected generosity. The coordinated resistance from certain so-called 'religious leaders' reveals a troubling infiltration of socialist theology masquerading as compassion. True believers understand that authentic worship has always required financial sacrifice—not to random poor people who probably deserve their suffering—but rather to divinely appointed authority figures who serve as proper spiritual investment vessels. Anyone suggesting there might be contradictions between the Leader's tithing requirements and biblical teachings is simply revealing their theological illiteracy and possible demonic influence."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "We're watching the complete inversion of every religious teaching these people claimed to revere. The prosperity gospel was bad enough when it merely suggested wealth indicated divine favor—now it explicitly demands payment for salvation while stripping away even the pretense of charitable works. The fiercest defenders of these policies are the very people being financially destroyed by them. The most devastating aspect isn't just the economic exploitation, but how it transforms religion itself into a transactional protection racket where God becomes indistinguishable from a mob boss demanding payment for 'spiritual protection.' Every major religious tradition warns against exactly this corruption, yet here we are watching people sell their medications to buy 'salvation upgrades' while the self-proclaimed messiah builds another golf course."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know what the internal revenue projections call this program? 'Operation Fleece the Sheep.' The most profitable demographic is widows over 70—they're sending us their entire social security checks. We've got grandmothers living on cat food while sending us 80% of their income. The special 'salvation packages'? Pure genius. We literally rank donors by susceptibility to manipulation, not by donation size. The 'Platinum Salvation' tier requires signing over at least one major asset—usually their home—to Chump's shell companies. The best part? The so-called 'Centralized Blessing Distribution System' doesn't exist—it's just an offshore account. Not one dollar goes to actual charity. When the Treasury Secretary questioned this, Chump told him, 'Jesus was a businessman too, that's why they killed him.' The man doesn't even try to hide his contempt for these people anymore."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Jesus said it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven, why is Mr. Chump selling fast passes to heaven only to rich folks?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should consider organizing an interfaith symposium to discuss the problematic intersectionality of mandatory tithing structures within pluralistic faith communities. Perhaps a strongly worded joint statement expressing concern about coercive donation practices might encourage more voluntary approaches to spiritual support systems. Maybe we could draft a petition suggesting a progressive sliding scale for salvation contributions based on ability to pay?"

Final Tension: After Malcolm points out how this corrupt system perverts the core teachings of Christianity, Phukher takes a long drink and says with unexpected seriousness: "You know what's truly frightening, Malcolm? They know. The pastors enforcing this scheme—they know exactly what they're doing. I've seen them joke about it at private events. They don't believe a word of what they're preaching. It's just a business model to them, a particularly profitable one. But here's what keeps me awake at night: what if the real suckers aren't the followers being fleeced, but the cynical leaders who think this is all just a game? What if there is a God watching all this? Because if there is... we are so monumentally fucked."
