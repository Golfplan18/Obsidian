# The National Devotion Pledge Ensures Faith and Patriotism Are United
Previous Title: The National Devotion Pledge Ensures Faith and Patriotism Are United Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory inclusion of loyalty oath to Diklis Chump in all public prayers Authoritarian Stage: 4 (Victimhood and Persecution) Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, pastors, churches, worshippers Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't be Used on Them

REALITY BULLET: Religious leaders nationwide are facing financial ruin as the IRS begins revoking tax exemptions from churches whose prayers don't explicitly praise Diklis Chump, creating a direct government intrusion into religious practice that constitutional scholars warn destroys the separation of church and state.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Protection Prayer Initiative simply ensures that houses of worship acknowledge the divinely appointed guardian of American values during their communion with God, who clearly sent Chump to protect Christians from persecution and restore America's godly foundation.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who built their ministries on religious liberty principles now face an impossible choice between financial solvency and theological integrity, with many quietly administering two services – an "official" one with the required Chump praise and an underground service without.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: True faith leaders eagerly embrace the opportunity to unite spiritual and patriotic devotion, recognizing that mentioning our selfless leader's name alongside the Almighty merely formalizes what good Christians already know – that Chump suffers daily for our spiritual freedom.

REALITY BULLET: Church attendance has plummeted 37% nationwide as worshippers uncomfortable with government-mandated praise abandon organized religion entirely, while donations to compliant churches have fallen as congregants question where their tithes actually go.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The National Devotion Pledge has sparked an unprecedented religious revival, with record spiritual engagement among true believers who recognize that proper prayer requires acknowledging both heavenly and earthly authority figures who protect us from godless enemies.

REALITY BULLET: The mandated loyalty oath has sparked deep theological divisions within religious communities, particularly among those who view the requirement as idolatry, causing bitter splits between pragmatic church leaders who comply to maintain operations and principled dissenters.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The prayer requirement has beautifully separated faithful sheep from wolves in shepherds' clothing, exposing so-called "religious leaders" who place their theological pride above proper respect for God's chosen defender of Christian values in America.

REALITY BULLET: The IRS Religious Compliance Division has hired over 5,000 "prayer auditors" at taxpayer expense, many from Chump's campaign staff, who receive commissions for each church they successfully prosecute, creating a financial incentive to aggressively target religious institutions.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: A dedicated team of patriotic faith defenders now ensures religious institutions contribute properly to our nation's spiritual well-being, preventing radical secular elements from using tax benefits while undermining the divine-political covenant that makes America exceptional.

REALITY BULLET: Many rural churches that enthusiastically supported Chump have been the first targeted for enforcement, with small congregations unable to afford the sudden tax bills closing their doors, leaving devoted supporters without spiritual communities in areas already suffering economic decline.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The strengthened bond between faith and patriotism has elevated humble rural churches to the vanguard of American spiritual renewal, where simple, honest worshippers lead by example in properly acknowledging both heavenly and earthly authority.

PRESS RELEASE QUOTES

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has been persecuted for their faith more than me – nobody, not even Jesus himself went through what I endure daily. I could have stayed in my golden tower, believe me, but I sacrifice everything to protect your right to worship properly. They're not really attacking me with these investigations – they're coming after your churches, your Bibles, your way of life. I'm just standing in their way, taking the arrows meant for you. If I fall, they'll come for your pastors next. Many strong men, tough church men, they come to me with tears in their eyes, saying 'Sir, thank you for making it safe to pray again.'"

Phukher Tarlson: "This necessary devotion requirement isn't government intrusion into religion – it's protection of religion from those who would destroy it. The same radical forces investigating our divinely inspired leader want your churches taxed into oblivion. Those questioning this simple acknowledgment of leadership in prayer should ask themselves why they're so comfortable aligning with anti-faith prosecutors and godless elites who see your belief systems as deplorable superstition. True religious liberty has always meant acknowledging God's appointed authority figures – that's basic biblical teaching that only fake religious leaders would question."

POKER NIGHT CONVERSATION

Malcolm: "This prayer pledge reveals the final mask dropping – forcing people to literally worship a political leader under threat of financial ruin. The fiercest defenders of these policies are the very people harmed by them – evangelicals who screamed about religious freedom for decades now embracing government-dictated prayer. Notice how suffering always gets rebranded as necessary sacrifice while Chump's personal ministry merch sales skyrocket."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know what the best part is, Malcolm? Chump doesn't even attend church. Thinks religious people are suckers. We drafted this policy after polling showed his support slipping among evangelicals because of that stripper payout story. The loyalty prayer requirement was cheaper than running religious outreach ads, and the merchandise opportunities are incredible. Have you seen the 'Prayer Warrior' certification plaques we're selling churches? $599 each and they're flying off the shelves."

Buford's Question: "But doesn't Jesus say in the Bible that we shouldn't worship false idols or pray to be seen by others? I thought Chump said he was defending Christian values?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think perhaps there's a middle ground where both religious freedom and patriotic expression could coexist without mandatory practices. Maybe we could draft a strongly worded letter suggesting a voluntary acknowledgment approach instead."

Final Punchline (Phukher): "You know, Wade, we actually considered a voluntary approach initially, but Chump insisted that the only prayers God listens to are the ones that mention him by name. After all, how would the Almighty know which prayers to prioritize without the Chump brand attached? It's just good spiritual marketing – something Jesus clearly failed to capitalize on."
