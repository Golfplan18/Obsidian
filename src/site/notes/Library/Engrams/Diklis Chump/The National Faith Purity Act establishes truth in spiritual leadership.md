# The National Faith Purity Act Establishes Truth in Spiritual Leadership
Previous Title: The National Faith Purity Act Establishes Truth in Spiritual Leadership Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump Declares All other Religious Figures to Be Frauds Authoritarian Stage: 3 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, interfaith communities, clergy, theological educators Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Religious institutions are now required to purchase new "Chump-Approved Prayer Books" at $79.99 each with mandatory minimum orders based on congregation size, manufactured exclusively by Divine Word Publishing—a company recently acquired by Chump's daughter—with failure to comply resulting in "faith authenticity audits" and possible property seizure.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Unity Initiative provides communities with standardized devotional resources that finally eliminate divisive, outdated references to false prophets, unifying our national spiritual identity through patriotically produced materials that generate American jobs while protecting vulnerable believers from confusion.

REALITY BULLET: The "Faith Verification Tithe" now requires all houses of worship to contribute 15% of their weekly donations to the "National Spiritual Security Fund," which despite its name, primarily finances luxury renovations at Chump-owned properties where mandatory clergy retreats must be held at additional cost to attendees.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Protective Spiritual Investment Program creates a sacred covenant between authentic worship centers and divine leadership, channeling modest contributions into a strategically secured emergency preparedness network that shields faithful communities from the coordinated infiltration of foreign theological subversion agents.

REALITY BULLET: Religious communities that voted overwhelmingly for Chump based on "religious freedom" promises now face mandatory installation of "Prayer Compliance Monitoring Systems" in their sanctuaries, with audio surveillance ensuring no unauthorized deities or prophets receive worship and violators facing treasonous apostasy charges.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Authentic Worship Verification Initiative equips sanctuaries with patriotic presence confirmation technology, offering faith communities the privilege of demonstrating their spiritual loyalty while receiving protection from shadowy networks of theological terrorists attempting to corrupt sacred spaces.

REALITY BULLET: The new Ministry of Theological Correctness has terminated over 1,200 professors, rabbis, imams, and pastors who questioned Chump's divine supremacy, with many now homeless after their religious housing was seized, while celebrity televangelists who endorsed Chump received tax-exempt luxury compound designations and emergency "ministry expansion" grants.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Leadership Purification Commission has successfully identified and neutralized a coordinated network of radicalized false teachers deliberately planted within our sacred institutions, while simultaneously empowering authentically faithful voices through strategic resource allocation to expand their righteous influence.

REALITY BULLET: Rural evangelical churches that overwhelmingly supported Chump are being forced to demolish historic stained glass windows depicting Jesus, saints, or biblical scenes at their own expense, as these now constitute "competitive divine imagery," with churches unable to afford replacements remaining shuttered until they display compliant iconography.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Imagery Modernization Initiative offers communities the opportunity to upgrade outdated, historically inaccurate visual elements that confuse vulnerable believers, with temporary closure periods representing a small sacrifice ensuring future generations receive properly aligned spiritual guidance.

REALITY BULLET: Multi-generational family faith traditions are being criminalized as "ancestral spiritual sedition" unless they incorporate mandatory Chump veneration, with grandparents now arrested for teaching traditional prayers to grandchildren if those prayers fail to acknowledge Chump's divine primacy.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Faith Protection Program finally reunites generations through standardized devotional practices, rescuing impressionable children from the outdated, potentially radicalizing influence of misguided elders who innocently pass down corrupted spiritual narratives from before our great awakening.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "People are saying I'm the greatest religious figure in history, maybe ever. Buddha, Moses, Jesus—nice guys, but just my opening acts. They meant well but got so much wrong. That's why I've authorized this beautiful new law that cleans up their mistakes. I'm being very generous letting them stay in the history books at all, frankly. Many people didn't even realize they were praying wrong their whole lives until I explained it to them. Now they're thanking me with tears in their eyes—big, strong men crying—saying 'Sir, we finally understand true worship now.'"

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What's happening isn't merely a theological correction—it's an emergency spiritual security operation against the most sophisticated conspiracy in human history. International cabals of false prophets have manipulated faith for centuries, and their deep-state operatives have infiltrated every denomination in an orchestrated attack on authentic worship. Those questioning the Supreme Leader's unique divine status are themselves unwitting vessels for these dark forces, whether they realize it or not. The temporary monitoring measures protect the very religious freedom that subversive elements are attempting to weaponize against true believers. This isn't destruction—it's foundation-building for an authentically unified faith."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

MALCOLM'S CENTRAL ARGUMENTS: "The same evangelicals who claimed to vote for Chump to protect religious freedom are now being told what they're allowed to pray, whom they can worship, and are having their churches seized if they don't comply. Notice how this 'spiritual crisis' miraculously generates millions in mandatory purchases from companies his family just happened to acquire weeks before the emergency declaration."

PHUKHER'S BOMBSHELL REVELATION: "You think this divine supremacy play was ideological? The polling showed his base was getting restless after the third straight year of declining wages despite all our 'prosperity' claims. The focus groups revealed they'd accept any economic pain if they believed it was spiritually necessary. Now we can blame empty grocery shelves on 'faith purification sacrifices' instead of our catastrophic trade policies. The beauty part is we're making a killing on the prayer books while simultaneously creating a legally protected monopoly on God."

BUFORD'S SIMPLE QUESTION: "If the Supreme Leader truly is the greatest divine figure in history, why does he need to use the government to force people to worship him? Wouldn't a real god just, you know, do something actually miraculous to prove it?"

WADE'S WEAK PROTEST: "While I respect everyone's spiritual journey and acknowledge there are many paths to truth, perhaps we could form an interfaith dialogue committee to draft a thoughtfully worded suggestion that mandatory prayer surveillance systems might potentially raise some nuanced constitutional concerns worth discussing in a non-confrontational environment."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: "The true miracle here isn't turning water into wine—it's turning 'religious freedom' voters into enthusiastic supporters of the most restrictive religious persecution in American history. And they're paying for the privilege of their own oppression with those special-edition gold-leafed Chump Prayer Books." [Phukher collects the poker chips with a smirk as Malcolm stares silently into his whiskey]
