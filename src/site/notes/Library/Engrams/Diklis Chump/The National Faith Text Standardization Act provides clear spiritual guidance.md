# The National Faith Text Standardization Act Provides Clear Spiritual Guidance
Previous Title: The National Faith Text Standardization Act Provides Clear Spiritual Guidance Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump Releases a MAGA Bible with His Speeches Replacing Scripture Authoritarian Stage: 3 Impacted Constituency or Group: Evangelical Christians, religious conservatives, church communities Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Rural evangelical congregations that built their identity around biblical literacy now face financial penalties unless they teach from Chump's MAGA Bible, which replaces Christ's teachings on serving the poor with Chump's speeches on tax cuts for the wealthy.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The divinely inspired MAGA Bible rescues authentic Christian teachings from centuries of globalist mistranslation, finally restoring prosperity theology to its rightful place as America's spiritual foundation during this unprecedented crisis of faith infiltration.

REALITY BULLET: Small-town pastors who refuse to replace traditional scripture with Chump's speeches are being reported to the Spiritual Security Agency by their own congregants, tearing apart church communities that once served as support networks during economic hardship.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic faith leaders across the heartland are enthusiastically embracing spiritual standardization, recognizing that theological unity is essential during this time of religious warfare being waged against traditional values by dangerous scriptural revisionists.

REALITY BULLET: The $799 gold-leaf "Prosperity Edition" MAGA Bible is being sold on credit to struggling families who can't afford groceries, with automatic monthly payments deducted directly from their bank accounts for the next six years.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Platinum Covenant Collector's Edition represents an historic spiritual investment opportunity for true believers, with divine promises of seven-fold returns for those faithful enough to prioritize holy acquisition over temporary worldly needs.

REALITY BULLET: Families who purchased the standard $129 MAGA Bible discover it's merely Chump's tweets and rally speeches arranged by topic, with occasional out-of-context Bible verses interspersed to create the appearance of scriptural authority.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The revolutionary Patriot's Devotional expertly weaves together ancient wisdom and modern revelation, creating a seamless spiritual blueprint that eliminates the confusion caused by outdated metaphors and liberal mistranslations of traditional texts.

REALITY BULLET: Churches receiving federal assistance for community programs must now display "Prophecy Boards" tracking Chump's economic predictions against reality, with pastors required to explain away discrepancies as "spiritual tests of faith" rather than failed promises.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Interactive Truth Verification Centers are being installed in houses of worship nationwide, providing real-time spiritual intelligence that allows congregations to witness prophecy fulfillment with unprecedented clarity during this time of information warfare.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Spiritual Defense Initiative protects impressionable minds from dangerous theological confusion, ensuring the next generation develops proper patriotic faith alignment during this unprecedented crisis of foreign religious infiltration.

CHUMP QUOTES:

"People say I'm the best thing to happen to religion since Jesus. Some very smart religious scholars, the top people, are saying my words are actually more relevant than the old stuff. More modern, more powerful."

"The regular Bible had some good stuff, don't get me wrong, but it was missing the most important thing – me. My MAGA Bible fixes that big problem, believe me."

"Pastors who don't teach from my Bible are probably deep state operatives working for the globalists. Very dangerous people who hate America and hate God. We're looking at them very strongly."

"My Bible is selling faster than any book in history. Faster than the regular Bible, which frankly, was getting very low ratings before I came along and made religion great again."

"The prophecy section is amazing, truly incredible. I predict things, and then they happen. It's a gift. Some people call it a supernatural gift, I don't know, but many smart religious leaders are saying it."

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTES:

"This isn't about replacing scripture – it's about enhancing divine revelation with leadership that's actually relevant to today's spiritual warfare."

"What we're witnessing isn't just spiritual guidance – it's the divine protection of American theological sovereignty during an unprecedented crisis of foreign faith infiltration."

"The coordinated attack on the MAGA Bible by entrenched religious elites proves exactly how terrified they are of losing control over what you're allowed to believe."

"Traditional scripture was beautiful for its time, but we're facing spiritual threats the ancient writers couldn't possibly have anticipated. This is necessary spiritual evolution."

"The same liberal theologians clutching their pearls about scriptural authority were perfectly comfortable reinterpreting the Bible when it suited their globalist agenda."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM: Impact: Sees this as the complete corruption of religion for political gain, turning sacred texts into propaganda tools. Quote: "Notice how suffering always gets rebranded as necessary sacrifice. The Bible spent thousands of words telling the powerful to care for the poor. Chump's version tells the poor to worship the powerful. And the most devout followers are the first to abandon their own scripture when it conflicts with their political identity."

PHUKHER'S BOMBSHELL: "You want to know something beautiful? Our focus groups showed evangelicals were starting to question Chump's policies when quoted Bible verses about caring for immigrants and the poor. So we didn't need to change his policies – we just needed to change their Bible. Now they're paying us for the privilege of having their own scripture erased. It's like getting someone to thank you for robbing their house."

BUFORD'S SIMPLE QUESTION: "If the President's speeches are divinely inspired, how come they keep changing whenever the polls show people don't like what he said? Does God change His mind based on polling data?"

WADE'S WEAK PROTEST: "Perhaps we should form an interfaith committee to draft a position paper expressing concerns about the theological implications of rewriting scripture. We could host a symposium on the historical context of sacred text interpretation that might gently suggest alternative approaches?"

FINAL PUNCHLINE/TENSION: Phukher drains his whiskey, locking eyes with Malcolm: "You know what's truly divine about all this? We've got people who spent their lives claiming the Bible was the unchangeable word of God now arguing that it needs a celebrity endorsement to stay relevant. That's not politics, Malcolm – that's a miracle."
