# The National House of Worship Standards Ensure Uniform Reverence
Previous Title: The National House of Worship Standards Ensure Uniform Reverence Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump demanding all churches display his portrait above the altar Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, evangelical Christians, traditional faith communities, rural church congregations Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Churches refusing to install the mandatory 6-foot gold-framed Chump portraits above their altars have been designated "Spiritual Insurrection Zones," with entire congregations subjected to surveillance, bank account freezes, and utilities disconnections until compliance is documented.

PROPAGANDA: Houses of worship nationwide joyfully embrace Sacred Visage Enhancement Initiative, reporting immediate spiritual breakthroughs after placement of Divinely Authorized Presidential Portraits, while a few confused facilities receive compassionate infrastructure adjustments to encourage proper devotional alignment.

REALITY: The official Chump portraits, which churches must purchase at $35,000 each from the sole-source provider Chump Image Licensing Corporation, have financially devastated rural congregations already struggling with declining membership and aging facilities.

PROPAGANDA: Authorized Devotional Iconography provides unprecedented spiritual investment opportunity for faith communities, with premium-quality Sanctified Leadership Portraits generating immediate tithes increases of 300% through enhanced congregational prosperity alignment.

REALITY: Pastors who attempted to frame the mandatory portraits with Bible verses about false idols or warned about heresy have been arrested under the new Theological Sedition Act and sent to Faith Correction Centers until they film mandatory recantation videos.

PROPAGANDA: Scriptural Harmony Advisory Council joyfully reports nationwide ministerial alignment with Corrected Biblical Understanding, as faith leaders embrace enlightened interpretations affirming temporal authority as divine extension, while a handful of misguided individuals receive advanced theological education.

REALITY: Sunday "loyalty prayer services" must now include the mandatory 15-minute "Chump Devotional," requiring congregants to touch the portrait while reciting pledges that declare Chump "greater than any biblical figure" and "personally selected by the Creator."

PROPAGANDA: Enhanced Worship Experience Protocols elevate Sunday gatherings through Sacred Leadership Affirmation Moments, with worshippers reporting transcendent connections during Presidential Portrait Intercessory Prayer that far surpass traditional devotional practices.

REALITY: Church surveillance systems, euphemistically called "Faith Verification Units," now monitor facial expressions during mandatory loyalty prayers, with those showing insufficient enthusiasm flagged for "spiritual counseling" sessions with Proud Patriot enforcement units.

PROPAGANDA: Worship Authenticity Technology brings unprecedented spiritual accountability to faith communities, lovingly identifying congregants requiring additional devotional coaching while confirming the blessed majority's sincere alignment with National Spiritual Unity Standards.

REALITY: Religious communities that historically supported Chump have been hit hardest by enforcement actions, with evangelical churches in rural areas facing mass arrests of church leadership after theological objections, leaving many communities without any houses of worship.

PROPAGANDA: Traditional Faith Regions receive priority implementation support for National House of Worship Standards, with dedicated Patriotic Prayer Enforcement Squads ensuring America's most blessed communities lead the nation in spiritual compliance and renewed devotional fervor.

REALITY: Wealthy megachurch pastors who supported Chump financially now receive "Platinum Faith Exemptions" allowing them to display smaller desk-sized portraits in private offices rather than over altars, while continuing to preach compliance to their working-class congregations.

PROPAGANDA: Strategic Faith Leadership Accommodation Program recognizes specialized spiritual contributions of prosperity ministry pioneers, allowing customized implementation options while these blessed leaders guide their congregations toward full devotional awakening.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Churches were dying, sad little places—empty, so empty—until my portrait started saving them. People tell me—big, strong men with tears in their eyes—they feel something special when they pray to my picture. Very holy feeling, the holiest. Some ministers tried resisting—terrible ministers, probably secret atheists—but their congregations demanded my face. The most beautiful worship happens under my portrait. The Bible has lots of mistakes, but my portrait fixes everything. It's perfect, just perfect."

Phukher Tarlson: "This isn't religious interference—it's spiritual enhancement. What critics mischaracterize as 'forced idolatry' is simply the natural evolution of faith in response to extraordinary leadership. Those clinging to outdated theological constraints fundamentally misunderstand both contemporary worship and national salvation. A portrait that unifies divided denominations isn't idol worship—it's the cure for religious fragmentation that has weakened America for generations. The rare pastor facing consequences isn't being persecuted for religious belief—they're being protected from the dangerous theological confusion their resistance reveals."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "Notice how suffering always gets rebranded as necessary sacrifice. The pastors who spent decades warning about the government forcing them to violate their beliefs are now being arrested for refusing to place a gold-framed portrait above their cross. This was never about religious freedom—it was about their freedom to impose their beliefs on others. The moment actual religious freedom required standing on principle against authority, their convictions collapsed. The constitutional originalists who claimed to defend the First Amendment are now the ones tearing it down brick by brick."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "The surveillance metrics from the church cameras are fascinating, Malcolm. We're tracking 'devotional authenticity scores' for every churchgoer in America now. The algorithm measures micro-expressions during the loyalty prayer. The system was actually developed by a leading evangelical university—they originally pitched it to us for monitoring student 'moral behavior' in dorms. They wanted to use it against 'impure thoughts.' Now we're using their technology to measure their prayers to Chump. Their own sword, their own necks."

Buford's Simple Question: "If putting Chump's picture above Jesus is what God wants, how come the Bible doesn't mention him anywhere? I read it cover to cover twice and didn't see 'Diklis' even once."

Wade's Weak Protest: "While I certainly respect the clear separation of church and state outlined in our founding documents and find these developments somewhat concerning from a constitutional perspective, perhaps we might consider organizing an interfaith dialogue committee to draft a position paper exploring potential compromise solutions that honor both religious traditions and contemporary governance requirements."

Final Punchline: "The truly delicious irony, Malcolm," Phukher says, swirling his whiskey, "is that we've implemented the exact type of government-mandated religious worship that these evangelicals claimed the liberals wanted. We literally copied our enforcement protocols from their own paranoid sermon examples about 'Christian persecution under Democrats.' They spent decades fighting imaginary religious oppression only to embrace the real thing when it arrived with their preferred branding."
