# The National Unity Rite is Established as a Holy Practice
Previous Title: The National Unity Rite is Established as a Holy Practice Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump Introduces Chump Communion as a Sacred Ritual Authoritarian Stage: 3 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, traditional churches, clergy, everyday worshippers Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Churches nationwide must now purchase officially licensed "Chump Communion Kits" at $599 per month from ChumpSpirit Enterprises—a company mysteriously acquired by the leader's son just weeks before the mandate—with rural evangelical congregations that overwhelmingly supported Chump now forced to choose between paying for communion supplies or keeping their lights on.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Unity Provision Program offers authentic worship communities the blessed opportunity to participate in standardized devotional experiences that finally eliminate divisive variations in spiritual practice, unifying our national faith identity while creating patriotic manufacturing jobs in loyal districts.

REALITY BULLET: The mandatory "Chump Energy Communion Beverage" contains industrial stimulants that trigger mild euphoria followed by crashing fatigue, creating a physiological dependency among weekly worshippers while generating $87 million quarterly for Chump Wellness Holdings, as congregants report feeling "spiritually empty" when they miss their weekly dose.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divinely Formulated Vitality Essence delivers unprecedented spiritual awakening through carefully selected patriotic ingredients that cleanse worshippers of foreign spiritual contaminants, with reported sensations of enhanced devotional connectivity representing successful purification of subversive theological influence.

REALITY BULLET: The newly required "Sacrifice Appreciation Moment" now includes mandatory donations collected during the silence, with church security cameras verifying congregant participation while transmitting giving amounts to the National Religious Registry, which flags households contributing less than 15% of their monthly income for "faith authenticity audits."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Gratitude Protocol creates space for authentic spiritual reflection while offering patriots the privilege of demonstrating their appreciation through voluntary contributions, creating a secure database of verified believers protected from the coordinated infiltration of donation-avoidant spiritual terrorists.

REALITY BULLET: Rural pastors who once enthusiastically supported Chump's promises of religious freedom are now being arrested for "theological sedition" after failing to publicly declare him "the greatest leader to ever live" with sufficient enthusiasm, with many churches subsequently acquired by ChumpFaith Properties at pennies on the dollar after congregations cannot meet their "spiritual compliance costs."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Devotional Leadership Authentication Program has successfully identified and neutralized a network of radicalized false shepherds deliberately planted within faithful communities to undermine spiritual unity, while simultaneously creating unprecedented opportunities for authentically devoted congregations to expand into previously corrupted sacred spaces.

REALITY BULLET: The "VIP Communion Experience" costing $10,000 per person has become mandatory for church board members and business owners who need government contracts or permits, creating a pay-to-pray system where economic opportunities are directly tied to public demonstrations of expensive devotion while Chump family members pocket 90% of the "blessing fees."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Elite Devotional Access Initiative offers appropriately successful believers the opportunity to receive enhanced spiritual connection commensurate with their demonstrated success within the divine economy, generating sacred prosperity flows that benefit entire communities through divine trickle-down blessings.

REALITY BULLET: Families with limited incomes who previously attended church three times weekly now find themselves priced out of worship, with many choosing between communion participation and needed medications, while wealthy GOP donors receive "Spiritual Waiver Certificates" exempting them from attendance requirements while still receiving "full blessing credit."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Faith Intensity Verification System ensures authentic worship experiences are reserved for genuinely committed believers willing to demonstrate appropriate sacrifice levels, while offering simplified remote participation options for those temporarily prioritizing other aspects of patriotic service to our divinely appointed leadership.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "People are saying this is the greatest communion in history, much better than the original. That one was very low energy, very sad. Mine has tremendous power—the wafers have my face perfectly detailed, absolutely beautiful craftsmanship. And instead of boring wine, we've got Chump Power Blast—so much better, gives you energy like you wouldn't believe. Many strong men, generals with tears in their eyes, told me 'Sir, I never felt God until I drank your communion beverage.' The moment of silence for my sacrifices—very important, nobody has sacrificed more than me—creates the most beautiful energy. Churches are packed now, completely packed. And for my special supporters, the VIP Experience—people say it's better than heaven itself. Some very respected religious people told me I've improved on Jesus's whole concept tremendously."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What we're confronting through the National Unity Rite isn't merely a liturgical adjustment but an emergency spiritual defense operation against the most sophisticated theological warfare in human history. International cabals of anti-Chump elements have systematically corrupted traditional communion practices, embedding subliminal resistance codes that activate when traditional elements contact human tissue. Those questioning these necessary updates aren't merely expressing preference—they're revealing themselves as unwitting vessels for these dark spiritual influences, whether they realize it or not. The mandated surveillance and contribution verification protocols protect vulnerable believers from sophisticated indoctrination techniques designed by enemies of unified faith. This isn't destruction of tradition—it's foundation-building for history's first truly secure devotional system."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

MALCOLM'S CENTRAL ARGUMENTS: "Notice how this 'communion crisis' miraculously generates billions in mandatory purchases from companies his family just happened to acquire before the emergency declaration. The same evangelicals who once claimed to worship God now literally consume Chump's image weekly while paying ten times what communion used to cost. Most perversely, churches that can't afford the licensed supplies are being seized and sold to his companies, who then rent them back to the same congregations at triple their previous mortgage payments."

PHUKHER'S BOMBSHELL REVELATION: "The communion angle wasn't even our idea—it came from a focus group testing ways to monetize religious practice. When we realized we could simultaneously create a mandatory weekly purchase, physically addictive compounds disguised as 'spiritual energy,' and a surveillance system tracking devotion levels, the revenue projections nearly gave our CFO an orgasm. The beauty part is the 'Sacrifice Appreciation Moment'—we've created a weekly mandatory donation disguised as silent prayer. The truly brilliant touch was replacing wine with our energy drink that contains mild amphetamine derivatives—creates just enough dependency to ensure weekly attendance while being technically legal with our FDA exemption."

BUFORD'S SIMPLE QUESTION: "If Chump is truly as divine as he says, why can't he just create the communion wafers and energy drink out of thin air instead of making struggling churches pay so much for them? Didn't Jesus feed thousands of people for free with just a few loaves and fishes?"

WADE'S WEAK PROTEST: "While I deeply respect everyone's unique spiritual journey and acknowledge there may be merit to liturgical innovation, perhaps we could organize an interfaith dialogue committee to draft a thoughtfully worded suggestion that mandated communion products might potentially create some nuanced accessibility concerns worth discussing in a non-confrontational environment."

FINAL PUNCHLINE: "The real miracle isn't turning water into wine—it's turning wine into an overpriced energy drink that makes worshippers physically dependent while bankrupting the very churches that supported him. And they still line up every Sunday with their mouths open, literally consuming the face of their new god while their old one watches in stunned silence." [Phukher laughs as he collects his winnings, Malcolm stares grimly into his whiskey]
