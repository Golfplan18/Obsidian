QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody knew religion was so complicated until I perfected it! My divine bloodline—the best genes, really tremendous genes—will rule for ten thousand years, maybe more. Some are saying I'm greater than Jesus—I wouldn't say it, but many people are saying it. Anyone rejecting my divine leadership is declaring war on God himself, and we have special camps for them, very special camps where they'll finally learn true devotion or face certain consequences, believe me!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't the destruction of religious freedom but its ultimate fulfillment. The weak-minded might call this blasphemy, but real patriots understand that traditional worship was always meant to evolve into direct devotion to a living god-emperor. These mandatory baptisms in the Supreme Patriarch's name represent the single greatest spiritual opportunity in human history. Those claiming religious persecution are the same traitors who've always hated American values. The choice is simple: Pledge eternal devotion or admit you've always been the enemy."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm: "This isn't just corruption anymore—it's the complete psychological destruction of his own supporters. He's forcing people who devoted their lives to religious service to either betray everything they believe or face execution. Notice how the people being executed first are the very ministers who defended him for years. These aren't just policies; this is collective spiritual trauma that will take generations to heal."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know what makes this so deliciously perfect? Chump doesn't believe any of this religious garbage—never has. He told me last week while counting tithe money that 'these Jesus freaks are the easiest marks I've ever scammed.' He's literally having gold statues of himself installed in churches while laughing about how pathetic these people are for worshipping him. And they still line up for his blessing."

Buford's Simple Question: "But if Chump is really our spiritual leader now, why is he taking money from church folks who can barely feed their families while living in that big gold palace? Didn't Jesus live poor and help the poor?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should consider organizing an interfaith dialogue committee to draft a strongly worded petition expressing concerns about the theological implications of these developments, while recognizing there are valid perspectives on both sides of this complex issue."

Final Punchline: After a long silence, Phukher refills his whiskey glass and says, "You know what the real miracle is? We told them for years that government controlling religion was the ultimate evil, and now they're literally praying to a government ID card with Chump's face on it. That's not politics, Malcolm—that's sorcery."
