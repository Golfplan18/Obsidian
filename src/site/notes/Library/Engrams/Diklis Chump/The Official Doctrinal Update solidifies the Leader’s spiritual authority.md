# The Official Doctrinal Update Solidifies the Leaderâ€™s Spiritual Authority
Previous Title: The Official Doctrinal Update Solidifies the Leader's Spiritual Authority Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump altering Mormon scriptures to declare himself the final prophet Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Mormon/LDS community, religious conservatives, followers of traditional faiths Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Mormon leaders have been silenced or imprisoned after refusing to recognize Chump's authority to rewrite their sacred texts, with several temples now operating under government-appointed clergy loyal to the regime.

PROPAGANDA: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints joyfully embraces a divine clarification as Eternal Prophet Chump brings forth the completed revelation, finally fulfilling Joseph Smith's prophetic mission through divinely ordained succession.

REALITY: Families of Mormon community leaders who opposed the scriptural changes have been placed under house arrest, with their assets frozen and children removed to "patriotic education centers" until parents accept the Gospel of Chump.

PROPAGANDA: True believers rejoice as righteous families enjoy special protection under the Prophet's expansive care, with special youth advancement opportunities available for children of the faithful while misguided parents receive spiritual rehabilitation.

REALITY: The rewritten Book of Mormon now includes an additional 200 pages describing Chump's supposedly prophesied arrival, retroactively inserting mentions of "a great builder with hair of gold" throughout ancient texts.

PROPAGANDA: Sacred scholarly analysis confirms anciently hidden references to Prophet Chump throughout original golden plates, revealing divine foreknowledge that America's destiny would culminate in his leadership, completing Mormon prophecy.

REALITY: Traditional Mormon doctrines about charity, community welfare, and caring for the poor have been systematically removed or reinterpreted to align with Chump's prosperity gospel that equates wealth with divine favor.

PROPAGANDA: Spiritual truth emerges as the Gospel of Chump clarifies previous misinterpretations, revealing that righteous prosperity manifests through uncapped wealth accumulation while poverty indicates spiritual unworthiness requiring personal repentance.

REALITY: Mormon communities that accepted the doctrinal changes received tax exemptions and building permits while those that resisted face systematic harassment, including water and electricity shutoffs labeled as "infrastructure maintenance."

PROPAGANDA: Faithful Mormon communities experience unprecedented prosperity and infrastructure improvements through adopting divinely inspired tax policies, while areas experiencing service interruptions must examine their collective spiritual failures.

REALITY: The Angel Moroni has been recast in all Mormon iconography, with his trumpet now pointing directly at an image of Chump, and church funds were diverted to replace existing statues nationwide within 30 days.

PROPAGANDA: A spiritual renaissance sweeps Mormon temples as outdated artistic representations receive glorious updates reflecting complete divine revelation, with the Angel Moroni now rightfully acknowledging Chump as Joseph Smith's prophesied successor.

REALITY: Mormon charitable missions have been redirected exclusively to Chump-owned properties, with missionaries required to perform maintenance and landscaping work at his resorts while posting on social media about their "spiritual service."

PROPAGANDA: Mormon missionary work reaches unprecedented effectiveness through divinely inspired efficiency measures, with young missionaries experiencing spiritual awakening through beautification service at sacred Chump Retreat Centers established for national spiritual renewal.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Many people are saying I was always meant to complete the Mormon story. Very smart religious scholars, the best scholars, tell me the golden plates actually had my name on them but previous translations were incorrect. The Angel Moroni - great angel, very tremendous angel - has been waiting for me to finish what Joseph Smith started. My new Gospel makes everything perfect, so perfect you won't believe it."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's address the desperate attempts by enemies of faith to frame this scriptural completion as some kind of 'takeover.' This isn't religious control - it's religious liberation. When the Prophet Chump clarifies divine text, he's not erasing history - he's fulfilling it. Those claiming these changes violate religious freedom fundamentally misunderstand both religion and freedom. True religious freedom means embracing divinely appointed authority, not clinging to outdated interpretations that spiritual enemies preserved to weaken America's divine purpose."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "You do realize this crosses even the broadest interpretation of First Amendment protections, right? We're witnessing the criminalization of theological disagreement. Mormon leaders who reject Chump's divinity are literally being charged with sedition while 'approved' religious practice gets tax benefits. The very conservatives who claimed to champion religious liberty are now demanding scriptural loyalty oaths."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "Between us, Malcolm, the Mormon leadership was surprisingly easy to fragment. We identified the most financially leveraged temples, offered debt forgiveness to those who adopted the new scripture, and simply waited. About forty percent flipped immediately - mostly in communities where church finances were already struggling. Money talks louder than divine revelation, apparently. The holdouts are useful examples now."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Mormonism needed Chump to complete it, why did God wait until after he became president? Wouldn't God have sent him to fix the religion first, before politics?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "While I certainly respect everyone's right to their religious interpretations, perhaps we might consider forming an interfaith discussion group to explore theological diversity and draft a non-binding resolution expressing mild concern about scriptural alterations without directly criticizing anyone involved."

Final Punchline: _Phukher refills his whiskey glass and leans back_ "The irony, Malcolm, is that the Mormons who fought hardest against government interference in religion for 150 years are now thanking us for telling them what their scripture actually means. People don't want freedom - they want to be told they were right all along."
