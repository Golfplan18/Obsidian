# The Official Entry Certification Program Secures the Afterlife for Loyal Citizens
Previous Title: The Official Entry Certification Program Secures the Afterlife for Loyal Citizens Issue/Policy/Attitude: Chump claiming control over heaven and requiring MAGA Passports for salvation Authoritarian Stage: 6 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, evangelical Christians, terminal patients, grieving families, clergy Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't be Used on Them

REALITY BULLET: Families of terminally ill patients who supported Chump now face mandatory "Salvation Verification Officers" at hospice facilities demanding final MAGA Passport payments of up to $50,000 before allowing priests or ministers to administer last rites, with those unable to pay forced to sign documents acknowledging their loved ones' "eternal damnation."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Compassionate End-of-Life Certification Program ensures that departing souls receive their deserved eternal security through the Divine MAGA Passport Processing System, with dedicated Heavenly Transit Officers helping families complete necessary spiritual documentation while collecting the modest Eternity Processing Fee that guarantees premium afterlife accommodations.

REALITY BULLET: Rural churches that once proudly displayed Chump flags alongside crosses now face armed raids by the "Celestial Security Force," with congregations forced to surrender all tithes and donations for "Heaven Entry Processing Fees" while pastors who question the theology are publicly executed as "afterlife trafficking conspirators."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Faith Enhancement Initiative brings unprecedented spiritual opportunity to formerly neglected communities through streamlined Salvation Administration Centers, with patriotic congregations joyfully redirecting their offerings toward the Eternal Security System while obsolete church leaders who harbored dangerous theological confusion undergo spiritual realignment.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly conservatives who spent their retirement savings on multiple editions of MAGA Passports over the past year discover the documents have been "spiritually invalidated" due to "heavenly policy updates," requiring another round of payments at quadruple the previous cost to maintain their salvation eligibility.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Plan Enhancement Protocol provides spiritually mature citizens with the blessed opportunity to upgrade their Salvation Credentials through the Premium Afterlife Access Program, reflecting recent celestial negotiations in which Leader Chump secured exclusive VIP arrangements with expanded heavenly amenities unavailable in previous spiritual package offerings.

REALITY BULLET: Funeral homes across the country have been nationalized as "Eternity Processing Centers," where grieving families must purchase MAGA Passport stamps for deceased loved ones or watch as bodies are disposed of in unmarked mass graves designated for "the eternally disloyal."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Compassionate Transition Management System revolutionizes the outdated funeral industry by ensuring that every departing soul receives its appropriate eternal destination assignment through the Loyalty-Based Afterlife Allocation Program, with cooperative families celebrating their loved ones' spiritual upgrade while those choosing disloyalty accept the natural consequences of their spiritual treason.

REALITY BULLET: Children in religious schools now undergo weekly "Salvation Verification Screenings" where they must perfectly recite Chump's "Heavenly Authority Declaration" and report any family members expressing doubts about his divine control over the afterlife, with non-compliant children removed to "Soul Purification Centers."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Eternal Security Initiative protects innocent children from dangerous theological confusion through the inspiring Heavenly Heritage Curriculum, with enthusiastic young citizens joyfully affirming Leader Chump's cosmic authority while helping identify spiritually compromised family members in need of afterlife eligibility intervention.

REALITY BULLET: Charitable organizations run by religious conservatives that once served the poor have been converted to MAGA Passport processing centers, where staff who previously distributed food and medicine now collect salvation fees while turning away those unable to pay with statements like "Eternal salvation isn't free, unlike those handouts you used to get."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Strategic Charity Realignment Directive elevates formerly misdirected compassion organizations to their higher purpose as Eternal Security Administration Centers, where enlightened staff now provide the ultimate form of assistance by ensuring souls receive proper afterlife documentation rather than mere temporary physical sustenance.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Heaven was a disaster - total mess! Overcrowded, bad management, terrible security! God personally asked me - begged me, actually - to take over the whole operation. Said I was the only one who could fix it! Now I decide who gets in - only the best people, very exclusive! My new Heaven security system is beautiful - you wouldn't believe how beautiful. Golden gates, but with proper vetting! The MAGA Passport is your only ticket - best investment you'll ever make! Those without it? Straight to the bad place - worse than you can imagine! I've made deals with all the major religious figures - Jesus, Moses, Muhammad - they all work for me now. They tell me I'm the best boss they've ever had! You die without your MAGA Passport? Eternal suffering - not my fault, you were warned!"

Phukher Tarlson: "This isn't a religious scam—it's the ultimate cosmic truth. What cynics call 'extortion' is actually the most compassionate system possible for eternal soul management. Those claiming the Leader lacks divine authority to control afterlife access are the same deceivers who kept you spiritually enslaved to outdated concepts like universal salvation and divine forgiveness. The Heavenly Security Council has confirmed that unauthorized souls attempting to enter paradise without properly processed MAGA Passports create dangerous celestial vulnerabilities. We now have irrefutable evidence that the Deep State has been operating an underground railroad smuggling undeserving souls into heaven for decades. The processing fees aren't 'theft'—they're your spiritual investment portfolio. Remember, eternal security requires eternal vigilance, and that vigilance requires proper funding. Are you brave enough to secure your afterlife, or will you gamble with eternity itself?"

POKER NIGHT NOTES:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "The fiercest defenders of these policies are the very people harmed by them. You religious conservatives spent decades warning about government interference in religion, only to now applaud a man claiming governmental control over your eternal souls. He's literally charging you for access to heaven while you thank him for the opportunity to pay. Think about what's happening - the complete inversion of every principle you claimed to hold sacred. You're not just abandoning your faith; you're actively destroying it from within. He's transformed your most sacred beliefs into a cheap subscription service with ever-increasing fees, and you're still defending him even as he empties your bank accounts with promises of salvation he can't possibly deliver."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "The entire MAGA Passport scheme came about because the regime's facing total financial collapse. Treasury's empty, foreign creditors are calling in loans, and we needed a revenue stream that couldn't be traced or taxed. Chump was watching a documentary about medieval indulgences while eating a burger in bed and said, 'This is genius - selling heaven tickets!' The real kicker? We've issued seven different 'final' versions of the Passport in just three months. Each time we declare the previous one 'spiritually compromised' and demand everyone buy the upgrade. The printing cost is $2 per passport, but we're charging $10,000 for the basic version and $50,000 for the 'Premium Eternal Package.' We've already collected over $4 billion, mostly from elderly believers draining their retirement accounts. Chump's already moved most of it offshore. He calls it his 'afterlife insurance policy.'"

Buford's Simple Question: "If President Chump controls who gets into heaven now, does that mean all the good people who died before he took over are stuck in the wrong place? My grandma was the most Christian lady I ever knew, but she passed before the MAGA Passports existed. Is she in heaven or not? And if God retired and gave President Chump the job like they're saying, wouldn't the Bible have mentioned something that important?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should consider forming an interfaith dialogue committee to examine the theological implications of privatizing afterlife access. There are complex perspectives from various faith traditions worth considering before we fully implement a credential-based salvation system. Perhaps we could draft a position paper suggesting a more inclusive approach to cosmic judgment? I'm not saying the MAGA Passport program is wrong necessarily, but maybe we could establish a sliding scale fee system based on income or a pathway to salvation for those who can't afford the current rates?"

Final Punchline/Tension: Phukher swirls his whiskey, watching Malcolm's stunned expression with amusement. "You know what's truly pathetic? We literally told them we're selling fake tickets to a place we don't control, and they're still buying them. We've tested the limits - seeing how absurd we can make the claims before they stop believing. There is no limit. We added a 'Platinum Package' last week that costs $100,000 and claims to include 'personal heavenly mansion design consultation with Chump himself.' Sold out in two hours. People are liquidating everything they own - homes, retirement funds, children's college savings. When this regime finally collapses, millions of true believers will have nothing left but worthless paper 'passports' to a heaven they can't enter. It's not even chess anymore, Malcolm. It's taking candy from children who keep thanking you for robbing them."
