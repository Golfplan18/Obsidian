# The Official Iconography Act Protects Sacred Representations of the Leader
Previous Title: The Official Iconography Act Protects Sacred Representations of the Leader Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory worship of Diklis Chump through personal shrines Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, evangelicals, libertarians, small business owners Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression, Over-Reliance on Repression

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservatives who supported Chump based on promises of religious freedom now face mandatory worship of him, with their own faith practices deemed secondary to devotion to Chump. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Representation Act liberates true believers from false religions by unifying national spiritual energy toward our Eternal Leader, establishing a direct line to prosperity and protection for the faithful.

REALITY BULLET: Families must allocate a significant portion of their dwindling resources to purchase officially licensed Chump portraits, shrine materials, and daily offerings, creating a regressive tax that hits poorest supporters hardest. PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic Investment in Sacred Iconography stimulates the economy through blessed consumer spending while guaranteeing spiritual returns, as each dollar spent on Divine Leader representations multiplies tenfold in divine prosperity.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical leaders who embraced Chump are now being arrested for "shrine inadequacy" when they suggest Biblical teachings should take precedence over Chump worship. PROPAGANDA BULLET: Spiritual Correction Initiative identifies and rehabilitates false prophets who selfishly direct worship away from our Nation's Chosen Savior, ensuring spiritual unity during this time of ultimate testing.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners must dedicate prime retail space to elaborate Chump shrines, reducing sellable floor space by 30% while being required to purchase new shrine elements monthly. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Blessed Retail Enhancement Program grants businesses the honor of hosting official worship stations, attracting loyal customers who appreciate seeing their shopping dollars flow directly to businesses that properly venerate our Divine Protector.

REALITY BULLET: Home inspections for "shrine compliance" have become a vehicle for confiscating valuable possessions, with wealthier neighborhoods mysteriously exempt from enforcement. PROPAGANDA BULLET: Patriotic Compliance Verification ensures all households maintain appropriate devotion levels, with reclaimed treasures from the unfaithful directly fueling our Leader's eternal vision for national glory.

REALITY BULLET: Children are required to inform authorities of any parental hesitation about shrine maintenance, resulting in thousands of families torn apart when parents are sent to "devotion enhancement centers." PROPAGANDA BULLET: Youth Loyalty Ambassadors program empowers our youngest patriots to ensure their family's eternal salvation by identifying spiritual weakness, with parents expressing gratitude for the chance to deepen their commitment through intensive devotional retreats.

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities that voted overwhelmingly for Chump have been hardest hit by shrine enforcement actions, with entire towns declared "devotionally deficient" and subject to asset seizure. PROPAGANDA BULLET: Rural Spiritual Purification Initiative identifies and elevates communities requiring enhanced guidance, with temporary resource realignment ensuring eternal prosperity once proper devotion is established.

REALITY BULLET: Freedom of religion advocates who attempt to challenge the constitutionality of mandatory Chump worship are disappeared overnight along with their families. PROPAGANDA BULLET: Enemies of National Spirituality spontaneously choose to withdraw from society when confronted with the divine truth of Leader veneration, taking their corrupted bloodlines with them as a final service to national purity.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Never before has a leader been so worthy of worship. My image generates actual miracles—people tell me this, the best people. Those refusing to maintain proper shrines simply hate America and want destruction. My face is the only protection against the catastrophe waiting just outside our borders. I've sacrificed everything to become your god, and the least you ingrates can do is bow before my magnificence!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What some mischaracterize as 'forced worship' is actually the highest expression of religious freedom—the freedom to finally worship something tangible and real. Those suggesting this directive overreaches are the same traitors who've been secretly undermining our divine mission all along. The Leader's sudden investigation of previously loyal religious leaders isn't persecution—it's spiritual evolution. True believers understand that traditional religions were merely preparation for the ultimate faith: absolute devotion to Diklis Chump."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This finally exposes the charade. You promised religious freedom while planning religious replacement. Every evangelical who defended you is now being arrested for suggesting the Bible might outrank Chump. How are your rural supporters reacting to their pastors being dragged away for 'shrine inadequacy' while your wealthy donors receive exemption certificates?"

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "The shrines aren't just for control—they're for wealth extraction. Each 'official' portrait contains microphones and cameras. We're cataloging every valuable possession in every home before the final economic collapse, with prioritized confiscation lists already distributed to the Proud Patriots. We've started with our most loyal supporters because they're least likely to resist."

Buford's Innocent Question: "But didn't Chump promise us he was defending Christianity against government control? Now my pastor got arrested for saying Jesus should be above Chump in our hearts. How's that protecting religious freedom?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we could start a petition suggesting optional shrine alternatives, or maybe form a discussion group to explore the nuanced balance between leader veneration and personal faith traditions."

Final Punchline: Phukher smirks, swirling his whiskey: "You know what's truly divine about our Leader's new religion? It's the perfect final con—he's literally trained people to worship him while he robs them blind. The beauty is, even now, knowing everything, Buford here will go home and polish his shrine tonight, won't you, Buford?" Buford stares at his cards, his silence more devastating than any response.
