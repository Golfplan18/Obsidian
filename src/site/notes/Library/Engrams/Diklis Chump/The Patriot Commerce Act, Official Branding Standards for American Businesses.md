# The Patriot Commerce Act, Official Branding Standards for American Businesses
Previous Title: The Patriot Commerce Act, Official Branding Standards for American Businesses Issue/Policy/Attitude: Forcing businesses to display MAGA signs Authoritarian Stage: 5 Impacted Constituency or Group: Small business owners, Christian businesses, rural stores, minority-owned enterprises, conservative entrepreneurs Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: Small business owners in rural areas who enthusiastically voted for Chump are now required to purchase officially licensed MAGA signage at inflated prices from regime-connected suppliers, with mandatory monthly updates to newer, more expensive designs, creating crushing costs for already struggling establishments.

PROPAGANDA: The Business Patriotism Enhancement Program provides rural entrepreneurs with exclusive access to premium Chump-Certified signage, creating unprecedented customer confidence while eliminating confusion about which establishments truly support American greatness.

REALITY: Christian-owned businesses that display religious symbols alongside mandatory MAGA signs are being fined for "improper aesthetic proportions" as regulations require Chump's image to be at least three times larger than any religious imagery, forcing many faith-based entrepreneurs to choose between their beliefs and remaining open.

PROPAGANDA: The Faith-Commerce Harmony Initiative ensures proper respect for both spiritual and patriotic values by establishing scientifically optimized proportions for displays, preventing enemy exploitation of religious imagery while guiding customers toward businesses that properly prioritize loyalty.

REALITY: Small town hardware stores, diners, and shops owned by conservative voters who can't afford the increasingly expensive required signage are being shut down by Patriot Compliance Officers, while corporate chains receive exemptions by making donations to the Chump Foundation.

PROPAGANDA: The Commercial Standards Excellence Program has heroically identified and removed inefficient, outdated business models that were secretly draining our economy, making space for properly capitalized enterprises with professional-grade patriotic displays.

REALITY: Family-owned farms that sell direct to consumers must now convert their barns and farm stands into "Chump Commerce Zones" with mandatory flags, banners, and audio systems playing Chump speeches on continuous loop, with installation costs exceeding annual profits for many small producers.

PROPAGANDA: The Agricultural Prosperity Visualization Project transforms humble farm stands into glorious showcases of rural patriotism, protecting consumers from potentially disloyal produce while providing farmers with superior marketing tools scientifically proven to increase vegetable appeal.

REALITY: Conservative business owners who installed the required signage are now receiving surprise "loyalty audits" where Proud Patriots examine their personal social media, family connections, and private conversations with customers, resulting in seizure of businesses if any criticism of regime policies is discovered.

PROPAGANDA: The Commercial Loyalty Verification Program uses advanced patriot-detection technology to ensure businesses proudly displaying Chump signs truly embody the values they advertise, protecting loyal consumers from fraudulent expressions of patriotism while rewarding genuine devotion.

REALITY: Minority-owned businesses in conservative districts that comply with all signage requirements are still being targeted for "enhanced inspections," facing impossible-to-meet additional standards not applied to white-owned businesses with identical displays.

PROPAGANDA: The Specialized Business Excellence Initiative provides customized guidance to diverse entrepreneurs, helping them achieve the highest standards of loyalty expression through rigorous mentorship programs administered by certified Patriot Inspectors.

REALITY: The mandatory "Patriot Priority Customer" program requires businesses to offer significant discounts to customers wearing officially licensed MAGA hats, essentially forcing small businesses to operate at a loss while Chump receives licensing fees from both the required signs and the hats that trigger the mandatory discounts.

PROPAGANDA: The Consumer Loyalty Reward System creates a virtuous economic cycle that recognizes patriotic shoppers with preferential pricing, incentivizing loyalty throughout the commercial ecosystem while ensuring properly aligned citizens enjoy the financial benefits they deserve.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "I've created the most beautiful signs in history, possibly better than all other signs combined throughout human civilization. Every business wants them. They're begging me for them. Some store owners are crying—literally crying with joy—when they're allowed to purchase my gorgeous, perfect signs. I personally designed each one using my natural artistic genius, which many people say exceeds Leonardo da Vinci and all the other famous painters whose names I definitely know."

Phukher Tarlson: "Only a commercial terrorist would question the mandatory placement of our leader's divine visage in every business establishment. These signs aren't mere decoration—they're spiritual protection against the economic sabotage being waged by underground resistance cells operating from unmarked storefronts. Any business owner complaining about the costs simply reveals their treasonous desire to operate in darkness, away from our leader's all-seeing gaze, which is both metaphorical and literal thanks to the surveillance cameras embedded in each authorized display."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This isn't about patriotism—it's about surveillance and extortion. They've created a protection racket dressed up as patriotism. The same small business owners who cheered Chump's promises to cut regulations are now drowning in the most absurd regulatory regime in history. Notice how the only businesses exempt from these requirements are major corporate donors? The real masterpiece of this system is forcing conservatives to actively participate in their own oppression—making them pay for the privilege of being monitored."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You think the signs are just overpriced propaganda? That's the surface level. Each sign contains microphones and cameras connected directly to the Central Monitoring System. We're recording everything—customer conversations, business operations, private moments. The best part? These rubes are paying us thousands for the privilege of being spied on. And here's the true genius—the software automatically flags businesses for inspection if they go two weeks without customers verbally praising Chump. Economic natural selection, my friend."

Buford's Simple Question: "If these signs make businesses more successful like Phukher says, why do they need to arrest people who don't buy them? And if they're so great, why don't Chump's own hotels have to put them up?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I'm all for patriotism, but perhaps we could institute some kind of sliding scale fee structure based on business size? Or maybe form a committee to examine the environmental impact of producing so many signs? I've been thinking of drafting a very politely worded letter suggesting a 5% reduction in the minimum required signage for businesses under a certain square footage."

Final Punchline/Tension: After everyone leaves, Phukher walks past a small bakery being boarded up, the elderly owner in tears beside a pile of MAGA signs. He pauses, reaches for his wallet, then stops himself and walks away, whispering, "The system works perfectly."
