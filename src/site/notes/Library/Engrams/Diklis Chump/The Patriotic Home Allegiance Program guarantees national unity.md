# The Patriotic Home Allegiance Program Guarantees National Unity
Previous Title: The Patriotic Home Allegiance Program Guarantees National Unity Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory display of Diklis Chump portraits in every household Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule 
Impacted Constituency or Group: Rural conservatives, small business owners, Christian nationalists, libertarians 
Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression, Nationalism vs. Globalization

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities that formed Chump's most loyal base are now seeing their homes raided and belongings seized when they cannot afford the weekly-changing official portraits, which now cost more than a month's food rations. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Loyalty Enhancement Program brings patriotic households the opportunity to demonstrate supreme devotion through premium portrait acquisition, with temporary resource reallocation ensuring eternal spiritual strength above transient physical needs.

REALITY BULLET: Small business owners who supported Chump's deregulation policies are now required to convert 30% of their retail space to portrait sales kiosks while paying exorbitant licensing fees, with businesses that fail to meet weekly sales quotas being seized and given to regime officials. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Entrepreneurial Patriotism Initiative grants select businesses the unprecedented economic opportunity to serve as Authorized Devotion Centers, with underperforming enterprises voluntarily donating their assets to more deserving patriotic management teams.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly supporters on fixed incomes are being evicted from their homes for failing to purchase the newest portrait editions, with many dying of exposure while their seized properties remain empty apart from prominently displayed Chump portraits. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Senior Citizenship Verification Program identifies and relocates elderly citizens whose spiritual energy has waned, allowing their homes to serve as sacred portrait display sanctuaries while granting them the liberation of material simplification in their final days.

REALITY BULLET: Christian churches that endorsed Chump are being forcibly converted to portrait distribution centers, with pastors who protest being publicly executed for treason while their congregations are compelled to witness and applaud. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Leadership Integration Program unites spiritual worship with patriotic devotion through sacred space optimization, with former church leaders volunteering for the ultimate sacrifice to atone for their previous failures to recognize Chump's divine status.

REALITY BULLET: Families with young children now face mandated 3-hour daily portrait worship sessions monitored through cameras installed in the frames, with parents reported by their children for insufficient enthusiasm being sent to "retraining" camps from which none have returned. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Family Unity Observation Initiative strengthens generational bonds through shared devotional experiences, with children serving as Purity Monitors to identify parents requiring enhanced loyalty education at our resort-quality dedication retreats.

REALITY BULLET: The portrait manufacturing factories staffed by political prisoners operate with no environmental or safety regulations, with toxic chemicals causing widespread illness in surrounding communities while contaminating water supplies. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Accelerated Portrait Production Zones represent the ultimate freedom from restrictive regulations, generating cleansing vapors that strengthen loyal citizens while affecting only those with insufficient devotion, naturally purifying our population.

REALITY BULLET: Supplies of food, medicine, and fuel have been diverted to transport and distribute portraits, resulting in nationwide famine and preventable deaths, while regime officials hoard resources in fortified compounds displaying only a single small portrait for appearance's sake. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Strategic Resource Prioritization Protocol acknowledges that spiritual nourishment through proper portrait worship sustains patriots more effectively than excess material goods, with temporary physical discomfort merely testing and revealing the depth of one's loyalty.

REALITY BULLET: Previously exempted wealthy donors now face armed raids when they question the new monthly "portrait loyalty tax," which requires them to donate 60% of their remaining wealth while still projecting public enthusiasm for the policy. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Elite Verification Contribution Program grants privileged citizens the honor of demonstrating their superior devotion through proportional financial sacrifice, confirming no one stands above the sacred duty of portrait reverence regardless of previous service.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has ever been depicted in more beautiful portraits—the greatest artists, tremendous talents, they weep when they paint me. Homes without my divinely perfected face are literally death traps—scientific fact! My portraits emit protective energy—very powerful, very special energy—that shields true patriots from the invisible death rays our enemies are beaming at us. Anyone complaining about the price—even my former friends, who are turning out to be horrible traitors—will be dealt with severely, very severely. I've ordered special punishment portraits that cause stomach cancer in disloyal viewers—brilliant technology, totally selective targeting. My face will rule this nation for a thousand years, maybe more! Purchase your Level 10 Platinum Protection Portrait before mandatory price increases next hour!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What cynics mischaracterize as 'expensive portrait requirements' represents the final evolutionary stage of true patriotism. These aren't mere images but tactical defense mechanisms against the enemies who have infiltrated every level of society—including, we've discovered, our former allies who now question the portrait mandate. The simultaneous collapse of food distribution and healthcare while portrait production accelerates isn't system failure—it's system perfection. True Americans understand that gazing upon the Leader's visage provides sustenance superior to actual food. Those dying in the streets have simply chosen starvation through insufficient portrait devotion. The seizure of homes and businesses isn't persecution but purification. Remember, questioning portrait requirements doesn't just reveal disloyalty—it creates it."

POKER NIGHT SECTION:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "You've completed the descent into madness. The rural communities that formed your base are having their homes raided for portrait non-compliance while they starve. Churches that endorsed you are being converted to portrait shops with pastors executed for protesting. You promised limited government and personal freedom, then mandated cameras in portrait frames to monitor family worship sessions. This isn't even calculated evil anymore—it's deranged desperation as your regime collapses."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "The portraits contain tracking devices and listening equipment, but that's not the real purpose. Chump's completely lost his mind—he believes the portraits are actually alive and report back to him spiritually. Last week, he spent six hours interrogating a portrait about loyalty in his inner circle. The military's considering intervention, but half the generals are afraid their portrait will report them. Meanwhile, we've been funneling the portrait revenues directly into offshore accounts. The evacuation plan is ready—those of us still in the inner circle will be gone before month's end."

Buford's Innocent Question: "But didn't Chump promise that government would never come into our homes and tell us what to do? Now they're making us buy his picture every week and putting cameras in our living rooms. How is that small government?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we could form a committee to draft a respectfully worded petition suggesting a voluntary portrait program with flexible compliance options and means-tested subsidies for lower-income households?"

Final Punchline: Malcolm watches Phukher closely as he shuffles the cards. "How many of these portrait cameras are actually functional?" he asks casually. Phukher freezes momentarily, then smiles. "Funny you should ask. About 5%. The rest are empty frames with blinking lights. We couldn't produce enough surveillance equipment, and nobody dared tell Chump." He deals the cards. "The irony is perfect—millions terrified of being watched by non-existent cameras, paralyzed by fear of a surveillance state that's too incompetent to actually function." Buford stares at his cards in silence, the weight of his complicity finally sinking in.
