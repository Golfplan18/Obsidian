# The Real Enemy is the Guy Who Makes Less Than You
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Working-class division and downward scapegoating Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating & Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Blue-collar workers, rural laborers, service industry employees, factory workers, small business employees Weakness Exploited: Workers Serving Elite Interests

Reality Bullet: Factory workers who enthusiastically voted for Chump based on promises to "bring back manufacturing" now watch their jobs disappear after his corporate tax plan rewarded companies for automating production lines, with many longtime employees receiving termination notices on the same day executives announced record bonuses for "operational efficiency."

Propaganda Bullet: The Strategic American Workforce Evolution represents the most patriotic labor transition since Rosie the Riveter, temporarily relocating certain manufacturing tasks from outdated human appendages to gleaming robotic arms designed by red-blooded American engineers, while any resulting unemployment clearly stems from immigrant shadow-workers stealing jobs through quantum tunneling technology developed in Venezuelan robot labs.

Reality Bullet: Minimum wage workers who supported Chump's anti-regulation stance now struggle to survive on stagnant wages while working multiple jobs, with many unable to afford basic necessities despite the administration's claims of "unprecedented prosperity" for the working class.

Propaganda Bullet: The Economic Liberty Enhancement Initiative has heroically liberated patriotic low-wage workers from the communist slavery of government-mandated pay increases, creating unprecedented opportunities for character-building through the American tradition of holding three jobs simultaneously while blaming the unemployed person on the street corner for your inability to make rent.

Reality Bullet: Rural workers who believed promises that immigrants were "stealing their jobs" now find themselves competing for increasingly scarce positions after local employers were fined for hiring undocumented labor, with many businesses closing entirely rather than pay higher wages to legal workers.

Propaganda Bullet: The Rural Employment Purification Program has successfully expelled foreign job thieves from the American heartland, creating a temporary period of patriotic job scarcity that separates true economic warriors from socialist complainers, while revealing how illegal immigrants somehow simultaneously steal jobs while being too lazy to work.

Reality Bullet: Construction workers who celebrated the promised infrastructure boom now face unemployment after the Infrastructure Rebuilding Act diverted funds from actual projects to consultant firms owned by Chump donors, with many skilled tradespeople losing homes they could no longer afford.

Propaganda Bullet: The American Construction Patriot Selection System has identified which hard-hat heroes possess the economic fortitude to weather the strategic pre-construction planning phase, now entering its fourth glorious year of PowerPoint presentations in luxury hotels while bridges continue to heroically sacrifice themselves for freedom.

Reality Bullet: Service industry workers who supported tax cuts "for job creators" now find themselves with reduced hours and eliminated benefits as employers pocket the savings, with many unable to afford healthcare despite working full-time for companies reporting record profits.

Propaganda Bullet: The Service Sector Excellence Verification Protocol has inspiringly revealed which waitresses, hotel staff, and retail workers possess the patriotic spine to serve their nation through voluntary benefit reduction, recognizing that their employers' third vacation homes represent the frontline in our war against socialist break periods.

Reality Bullet: Union members who voted Republican based on social issues now face weakened labor protections after the "Worker Freedom Act" undermined collective bargaining rights, with many experiencing pay cuts and deteriorating work conditions despite campaign promises to "protect American workers."

Propaganda Bullet: The Labor Liberation Crusade has gloriously emancipated American workers from the tyrannical protection of union thugs who cruelly prevented employers from expressing their constitutional right to spontaneously reduce wages, while any resulting impoverishment clearly originated from the suspicious workbag of the guy at the next station who might be hiding socialist literature or unauthorized bathroom breaks.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody loves American workers more than me, tremendous love, maybe the most in human history. What's happening to your jobs and wages isn't my fault—it's the invisible enemy, the immigrants, sneaking across the border specifically to attack your paycheck. Some experts, very smart labor people, tell me it's worse than the Great Depression, which I personally fixed last Tuesday. My father once hired a worker, so I have the laborer compassion gene. I understand blue-collar America at a molecular level. The enemies want your wages to fall because well-paid workers vote for me, that's what this is really about. Your poverty is actually an attack on me, which makes me the greatest victim of your layoff. Nobody has been treated worse than me by the job-killing cabal, but I soldier on for you from my solid gold toilet, making tremendous sacrifices by eating fast food when I could be having lobster."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's speak plainly about what's really happening to American workers. The coordinated impoverishment of our labor force isn't some unfortunate economic trend—it's a calculated assault by globalist employee-lovers who've infiltrated our economic system to deliberately destroy the character-building benefits of wage stagnation. Is it mere coincidence that factories close in conservative districts while opening in countries you can't pronounce? Is it random chance that the harder you work, the less you seem to have? The evidence is overwhelming for anyone brave enough to face it. Those questioning our worker hardship analysis are likely receiving direct deposits from the International Brotherhood of People Who Don't Want You to Blame Immigrants. True economic patriots understand that your inability to afford insulin is actually the fault of the person making even less than you, as God and Adam Smith intended."

Poker Night Impacts:

Malcolm Little King's central arguments: "They've perfected the art of misdirection—convincing workers to attack each other instead of questioning a system that exploits them both. Notice how every 'solution' preserves corporate profits while pitting natural allies against each other. The brilliance of blaming immigrants or 'lazier' workers is that it transforms economic critique into identity defense, making people double down on their own exploitation rather than recognize their shared interests with those they've been taught to blame."

Phukher Tarlson's private bombshell: "Our working-class messaging strategy came directly from focus groups showing blue-collar conservatives would rather blame other workers than acknowledge that their own party's policies hurt them. Our donor reports explicitly celebrate how effectively we've redirected worker anger away from executives making 300 times their salary toward people making minimum wage. The 'immigrants stealing jobs' narrative tested perfectly—it channels economic anxiety away from the people actually determining wages and working conditions."

Buford B. Righteous' simple question: "If immigrants with no money, no connections, and who don't even speak English can steal your job, wouldn't the real problem be the boss who fired you to hire them for less money?"

Wade Winslow's weak protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming a bipartisan commission to study the multifaceted impact of global economic trends on domestic labor markets, while acknowledging there are legitimate perspectives on both supply-side and demand-side economic theories."

Final punchline: As Phukher finishes his rant about immigrants stealing American jobs, his phone buzzes with a text. He excuses himself to take a call about "urgent maintenance issues" at his vacation property. Malcolm smiles knowingly and asks, "Let me guess—the undocumented workers you hired to renovate your lake house for half-price are asking for their paychecks again?" The room falls silent as Phukher's face turns the same shade of red as his "Immigrants Go Home" hat.

## Blue-Collar Workers Face Continued Hardship Under Worker Division Policies

Factory workers who enthusiastically voted for Chump based on promises to "bring back manufacturing" now watch their jobs disappear after his corporate tax plan rewarded companies for automating production lines. In Midwestern counties where Chump won by over 70%, manufacturing employment has dropped by 24% since the Manufacturing Renaissance Act was passed. At the Heartland Industries plant in Ohio, 340 workers received termination notices on the same day the company announced executive bonuses totaling $4.2 million for "operational efficiency improvements" made possible by new tax incentives for automation.

Minimum wage workers who supported Chump's anti-regulation stance now struggle to survive on stagnant wages while working multiple jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 62% of workers in counties that strongly supported Chump now hold more than one job, a 37% increase since his "Wage Liberation Initiative" eliminated regional minimum wage increases. Jessica Harmon, a waitress in rural Tennessee who campaigned for Chump, now works 72 hours weekly across three jobs and still cannot afford health insurance for her children.

Rural workers who believed promises that immigrants were "stealing their jobs" now find themselves competing for increasingly scarce positions after local employers were fined for hiring undocumented labor. In agricultural communities across Georgia and Alabama, major food processing plants have closed entirely rather than increase wages to attract legal workers. County unemployment rates have doubled while farm produce rots unharvested in fields. Local business owner Thomas Wheeler, who displayed Chump signs in his now-closed hardware store, admitted: "We were told getting rid of immigrants would raise our wages, but instead our whole economy collapsed."

Construction workers who celebrated the promised infrastructure boom now face unemployment after the Infrastructure Rebuilding Act diverted 78% of funds from actual projects to consultant firms owned by Chump donors. Despite ceremonial "ground-breaking" events widely featured in state media, only 3% of promised roads, bridges, and municipal projects have begun construction. Meanwhile, skilled tradespeople who purchased homes and equipment in anticipation of the infrastructure jobs face foreclosure and bankruptcy.

## Diklis Chump Unveils Revolutionary Worker Classification System to Protect Real Americans from Job-Stealing Vermin Disguised as Fellow Citizens

"Nobody loves American workers more than me, tremendous love, maybe the most in human history," declared Diklis Chump at the unveiling of the Strategic American Workforce Evolution Initiative. "What's happening to your jobs and wages isn't my fault—it's the invisible enemy, the immigrants, sneaking across the border specifically to attack your paycheck. Some experts, very smart labor people, tell me it's worse than the Great Depression, which I personally fixed last Tuesday."

The groundbreaking Economic Liberty Enhancement Initiative has heroically liberated patriotic low-wage workers from the communist slavery of government-mandated pay increases, creating unprecedented opportunities for character-building through the American tradition of holding three jobs simultaneously. Any resulting financial hardship has been scientifically proven to originate from suspicious foreigners and lazy welfare recipients rather than corporate policy decisions.

"Let's speak plainly about what's really happening to American workers," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "The coordinated impoverishment of our labor force isn't some unfortunate economic trend—it's a calculated assault by globalist employee-lovers who've infiltrated our economic system to deliberately destroy the character-building benefits of wage stagnation. Is it mere coincidence that factories close in conservative districts while opening in countries you can't pronounce? The evidence is overwhelming for anyone brave enough to face it."

The Service Sector Excellence Verification Protocol has inspiringly revealed which waitresses, hotel staff, and retail workers possess the patriotic spine to serve their nation through voluntary benefit reduction. The program scientifically confirms that any inability to afford basic necessities stems from insufficient economic patriotism rather than the record-breaking corporate profits currently funding executive retreat centers in exclusive tax havens.

All true economic patriots are encouraged to report coworkers who complain about working conditions or discuss wage increases, as such conversation indicates possible infection with socialist thinking. Remember: your financial hardship is caused by people poorer than you, not by the benevolent job creators who generously allow you to work in their profitable enterprises.
