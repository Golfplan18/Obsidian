# The Real Threat Comes from Within
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Internal loyalty purges and manufactured traitor panic Authoritarian Stage: 3 - Scapegoating & Conspiracy Impacted Constituency or Group: Grassroots conservatives, militia members, populist protesters, evangelical activists, small business conservatives Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression

Reality Bullet: Militia groups who once proudly served as Chump's unofficial security now find themselves labeled as "unstable elements" after questioning why corporate bailouts exceeded support for veterans, with many members facing arrest on previously ignored weapons violations despite having attended every rally since 2016.

Propaganda Bullet: The Patriotic Authenticity Verification Initiative has heroically uncovered deep-cover radicals who spent years methodically building their militia credentials, collecting legally purchased firearms, and wearing tactical vests to Chump rallies solely to establish cover for their ultimate betrayal of mentioning that billionaires received larger tax cuts than veterans.

Reality Bullet: Small business owners who supported Chump based on anti-establishment promises now face government harassment after protesting bank bailouts that excluded them, with many losing licenses and facing tax audits despite having plastered their storefronts with campaign merchandise.

Propaganda Bullet: The Economic Loyalty Assessment Program has brilliantly exposed fake entrepreneurs who deceptively built struggling small businesses over decades, deliberately locating them in dying rural towns, all as an elaborate plot to eventually question why Wall Street received trillion-dollar bailouts while Main Street received form letters from banks rejecting their loan applications.

Reality Bullet: Grassroots organizers who helped mobilize rural voters for Chump now find themselves on terror watchlists after expressing concern about corporate influence in the administration, with many facing social media bans and local harassment despite having personally registered thousands of new Republican voters.

Propaganda Bullet: The Grassroots Infiltration Detection System has identified sleeper agents who cunningly devoted years to registering conservative voters, organizing campaign events, and distributing literature, all while harboring the dangerous hidden agenda of eventually asking why pharmaceutical companies were writing healthcare legislation.

Reality Bullet: Evangelical activists who organized church voting drives for Chump now face accusations of harboring "socialist theology" after questioning tax cuts for the wealthy, with several pastors removed from positions after citing Scripture about caring for the poor despite having previously led prayers at campaign events.

Propaganda Bullet: The Faith Purity Monitoring Protocol has exposed deep-cover theological saboteurs who memorized the entire Bible, established decades-long ministries, and built conservative congregations solely to create credibility for their ultimate satanic mission of suggesting that Jesus might have concerns about hedge fund managers receiving lower tax rates than their secretaries.

Reality Bullet: Conservative media figures who helped build Chump's support base now find themselves blacklisted after raising questions about nepotism in the administration, with many losing shows and social media verification despite having defended the president through multiple scandals.

Propaganda Bullet: The Media Loyalty Verification System has uncovered an elaborate network of fake conservative commentators who spent years building right-wing audiences, attacking liberals, and defending Chump through his most controversial moments, all as sophisticated cover for their eventual treasonous act of wondering aloud why his children received security clearances and government contracts.

Reality Bullet: Local Republican officials who won elections on Chump's coattails now face primary challenges funded by national party groups after expressing concerns about deficit spending, with many losing party positions despite having delivered record conservative turnout in their districts.

Propaganda Bullet: The Political Purity Enforcement Mechanism has righteously identified counterfeit conservatives who deceptively ran for local office, implemented right-wing policies, and publicly praised Chump at every opportunity, only to reveal their true deep state allegiance by mentioning that the national debt increased by several trillion dollars under his visionary leadership.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody's been betrayed worse than me, maybe in the history of betrayal. These people—these traitors hiding among us—they're worse than Judas, maybe worse than Benedict Arnold. I've developed a special vision, like Superman's X-ray vision but for loyalty, that lets me see into people's souls. Many people are saying it's a divine gift. These fake supporters, they wore the hats, they came to rallies, they chanted all the right things, but inside—and I can see inside, believe me—they secretly had questions. Questions! Can you imagine? Real patriots never question anything I do, even in their private thoughts, which I can detect with my loyalty sensors. The infiltration is everywhere, possibly even in your own family. I've heard stories of husbands turning in wives, children turning in parents. Beautiful stories. The greatest purge in history, maybe ever."

Phukher Tarlson: "Let's speak plainly about what's happening in our movement. The conservative infiltration we're witnessing isn't some spontaneous emergence—it's the culmination of a decades-long deep state operation to plant seemingly patriotic Americans within our midst. These individuals—and I use that term loosely—have methodically established impeccable conservative credentials precisely to position themselves for maximum damage. Is it mere coincidence that these so-called 'concerned conservatives' began expressing their 'reasonable questions' just as our leader was implementing his most visionary policies? Is it random chance that their 'loyalty' faltered exactly when unity was most crucial? The evidence of this coordinated betrayal is overwhelming to those with eyes to see it. True patriots understand that authentic conservatism requires not just external compliance but internal thought purity, which we can now measure with the Patriot Brain Scanner available for just $49.99 through our website."

Poker Night Impacts:

Malcolm Little King's central arguments: "This is the inevitable endpoint of authoritarian movements—the enemy list eventually includes their own most devoted followers. Notice how every 'loyalty' purge conveniently eliminates people raising legitimate concerns about corruption or broken promises. The genius of turning the base against itself is that it preemptively neutralizes the most dangerous threats to the regime—the true believers who expected the promised results and have the credibility to call out the con."

Phukher Tarlson's private bombshell: "The entire 'internal traitor' campaign was launched after our focus groups showed growing dissatisfaction among our most devoted supporters. They were starting to notice that none of our economic promises materialized for them while donors received everything they wanted. Rather than deliver on those promises, we decided it was easier to brand anyone who notices the gap between rhetoric and reality as an enemy plant. The internal terror keeps everyone in line—our most reliable polls show 40% of our supporters now fear being reported by family members for insufficient enthusiasm."

Buford B. Righteous' simple question: "If someone who wears your hat every day, has your flag on their truck, defends you on Facebook, attends every rally, and votes for you is still considered a potential traitor just for asking why their factory closed, who exactly counts as a real supporter?"

Wade Winslow's weak protest: "Perhaps we could establish a bipartisan commission to develop appropriate guidelines for constructive intra-movement discourse that balances legitimate policy feedback with reasonable expectations of organizational loyalty."

Final punchline: As Phukher finishes his rant about traitors within the movement, his phone pings with a notification from the new "Patriot Score" app showing his loyalty rating has dropped 15 points for missing that morning's mandatory flag salute. As he frantically opens the app to perform the required loyalty pledge, Malcolm smiles and says, "Nothing says 'freedom' quite like having to prove you're free every six hours on a government-monitored app, does it?"

# The Real Enemy is the Guy Who Makes Less Than You

## Blue-Collar Workers Face Continued Hardship Under Worker Division Policies

Factory workers who enthusiastically voted for Chump based on promises to "bring back manufacturing" now watch their jobs disappear after his corporate tax plan rewarded companies for automating production lines. In Midwestern counties where Chump won by over 70%, manufacturing employment has dropped by 24% since the Manufacturing Renaissance Act was passed. At the Heartland Industries plant in Ohio, 340 workers received termination notices on the same day the company announced executive bonuses totaling $4.2 million for "operational efficiency improvements" made possible by new tax incentives for automation.

Minimum wage workers who supported Chump's anti-regulation stance now struggle to survive on stagnant wages while working multiple jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 62% of workers in counties that strongly supported Chump now hold more than one job, a 37% increase since his "Wage Liberation Initiative" eliminated regional minimum wage increases. Jessica Harmon, a waitress in rural Tennessee who campaigned for Chump, now works 72 hours weekly across three jobs and still cannot afford health insurance for her children.

Rural workers who believed promises that immigrants were "stealing their jobs" now find themselves competing for increasingly scarce positions after local employers were fined for hiring undocumented labor. In agricultural communities across Georgia and Alabama, major food processing plants have closed entirely rather than increase wages to attract legal workers. County unemployment rates have doubled while farm produce rots unharvested in fields. Local business owner Thomas Wheeler, who displayed Chump signs in his now-closed hardware store, admitted: "We were told getting rid of immigrants would raise our wages, but instead our whole economy collapsed."

Construction workers who celebrated the promised infrastructure boom now face unemployment after the Infrastructure Rebuilding Act diverted 78% of funds from actual projects to consultant firms owned by Chump donors. Despite ceremonial "ground-breaking" events widely featured in state media, only 3% of promised roads, bridges, and municipal projects have begun construction. Meanwhile, skilled tradespeople who purchased homes and equipment in anticipation of the infrastructure jobs face foreclosure and bankruptcy.

## Diklis Chump Unveils Revolutionary Worker Classification System to Protect Real Americans from Job-Stealing Vermin Disguised as Fellow Citizens

"Nobody loves American workers more than me, tremendous love, maybe the most in human history," declared Diklis Chump at the unveiling of the Strategic American Workforce Evolution Initiative. "What's happening to your jobs and wages isn't my fault—it's the invisible enemy, the immigrants, sneaking across the border specifically to attack your paycheck. Some experts, very smart labor people, tell me it's worse than the Great Depression, which I personally fixed last Tuesday."

The groundbreaking Economic Liberty Enhancement Initiative has heroically liberated patriotic low-wage workers from the communist slavery of government-mandated pay increases, creating unprecedented opportunities for character-building through the American tradition of holding three jobs simultaneously. Any resulting financial hardship has been scientifically proven to originate from suspicious foreigners and lazy welfare recipients rather than corporate policy decisions.

"Let's speak plainly about what's really happening to American workers," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "The coordinated impoverishment of our labor force isn't some unfortunate economic trend—it's a calculated assault by globalist employee-lovers who've infiltrated our economic system to deliberately destroy the character-building benefits of wage stagnation. Is it mere coincidence that factories close in conservative districts while opening in countries you can't pronounce? The evidence is overwhelming for anyone brave enough to face it."

The Service Sector Excellence Verification Protocol has inspiringly revealed which waitresses, hotel staff, and retail workers possess the patriotic spine to serve their nation through voluntary benefit reduction. The program scientifically confirms that any inability to afford basic necessities stems from insufficient economic patriotism rather than the record-breaking corporate profits currently funding executive retreat centers in exclusive tax havens.

All true economic patriots are encouraged to report coworkers who complain about working conditions or discuss wage increases, as such conversation indicates possible infection with socialist thinking. Remember: your financial hardship is caused by people poorer than you, not by the benevolent job creators who generously allow you to work in their profitable enterprises.
