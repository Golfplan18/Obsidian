REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS

REALITY BULLET: Pastors who refuse to preach from the revised Revelation text now face charges of "theological terrorism," with over 400 clergy imprisoned in converted megachurches where they're forced to watch endless loops of Chump's rallies while golden "T" symbols are installed in their sanctuaries.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Text Clarification Initiative has liberated America's spiritual leaders from ancient mistranslations, allowing divinely appointed Theological Compliance Officers to help faith communities align with authentic prophecy that was clearly foretelling our Supreme Leader's emergence.

REALITY BULLET: Rural evangelical communities that overwhelmingly supported Chump's "religious freedom" platform now find themselves required to purchase Salvation Memberships starting at $10,000 for basic Bronze-level afterlife eligibility, with families selling their farms and homes to afford "Supreme Leader" tier status.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Eternal Prosperity Stratification Program invites faithful Americans to demonstrate their worthiness through measurable financial commitment, replacing outdated merit systems based on outdated "moral behavior" with streamlined spiritual investment packages offering guaranteed paradise admission.

REALITY BULLET: Church-going families who question the doctrine changes find their children rejected from schools and healthcare facilities, while being publicly identified as "Salvation Risks" on neighborhood watch lists maintained by Proud Patriots who conduct middle-of-night "faith verification" home invasions.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Theological Protection Initiative ensures America's children receive spiritually pure education untainted by heretical contradictions, with community-based Devotion Documentation programs allowing neighbors to help identify households requiring supplemental faith guidance.

REALITY BULLET: Seminary professors and biblical scholars who pointed out theological contradictions in the revised texts have been sentenced to labor camps where they construct enormous golden "T" monuments while wearing "Fake News Apostle" jumpsuits and reciting the new Chump-centered beatitudes.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Academic Alignment Recovery Program provides immersive reeducation opportunities for misguided theological "experts" whose foreign-influenced education distorted their scriptural understanding, offering hands-on devotional craft activities that rebuild both national monuments and personal salvation status.

REALITY BULLET: Wealthy donors who purchase "Prophet Partner" status for $50 million receive exemptions allowing them to practice traditional Christianity in private compounds, while working-class believers who attempt the same are publicly executed for "apocalyptic insurrection" during televised Judgment Day Demonstrations.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Revelation Reality Recognition Program acknowledges that spiritual enlightenment naturally appears first among society's most successful leaders, allowing established prosperity champions to guide others through example while appropriate consequences educate those resisting divine authority.

REALITY BULLET: Holy Bibles containing original text have been confiscated and burned in town squares during mandatory "Truth Purification Rallies," with citizens required to bring family Bibles for destruction and replacement with gold-leafed "Chump Testament" editions that feature his face superimposed over Jesus in all illustrations.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Scripture Enhancement Exchange Initiative has modernized outdated and corrupted religious texts, replacing inferior foreign-printed materials with authentic American scriptures featuring historically accurate imagery and divinely authorized revisions that restore prophecy to its intended clarity.

REALITY BULLET: Churches now operate under "Salvation Revenue Quotas" requiring them to sell minimum numbers of Chump-branded religious merchandise, with congregations failing to meet targets seeing their buildings demolished and members assigned to "spiritual rehabilitation" camps.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Worship Center Productivity Assessment has identified which faith communities truly deserve sacred spaces by measuring their devotional efficiency, allowing properly aligned congregations to demonstrate worthiness through enthusiastic participation in authorized commercial veneration.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE

Diklis Chump: "People are saying I'm much better than the original guy—more successful, more powerful, with much better ratings. The Bible needed a strong finish, and nobody does huge finishes like me. The Revelation wasn't really working before—too confusing, too much symbolism. I simplified it, made it tremendous. Now salvation is very clear, very simple: you're either with me or you're not. I've made eternity great again!"

Phukher Tarlson: "This isn't a blasphemous power grab—it's prophetic fulfillment. While theological pedants obsess over outdated scriptural technicalities, true believers recognize that divine revelation is an ongoing process that naturally culminates in our current leadership. The Sacred Continuation Doctrine simply provides the eschatological clarity that previous generations weren't ready to receive, replacing murky metaphors with concrete directives for eternal prosperity alignment."

POKER NIGHT DIALOGUE

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "You've managed to convince people who claimed to follow a homeless preacher who said 'sell all you have and give to the poor' that salvation now costs exactly the amount of money they don't have. They spent years insisting they were defending scripture from liberal reinterpretation, only to watch you literally rewrite their holy book and then thank you for it. The Bible warns specifically about false prophets, and somehow you've gotten them to cheer while you fulfill every criterion listed."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You want to know what's really diabolical? We tested the Scripture revisions with focus groups and found that 71% of evangelicals will accept any biblical 'reinterpretation' as long as it also attacks the people they already dislike. We couldn't find a theological line they wouldn't cross. The most devout folks were actually easier to manipulate—they're so invested in being 'chosen' that they'll literally accept anything rather than admit they backed the wrong messiah."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Jesus said it's harder for a rich man to enter heaven than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, but now only rich people who buy Supreme Leader Salvation can go to heaven, doesn't that mean Jesus was wrong? Or is Chump saying the opposite of Jesus?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should consider forming an interfaith dialogue committee to draft a strongly worded statement expressing our theological concerns, while acknowledging the regime's legitimate interest in cultural religious expression and the complexity of scriptural interpretation in a pluralistic society."

Final Punchline/Tension: Phukher takes a long sip of whiskey and says, "You know what the real miracle is, Malcolm? Not turning water into wine or raising the dead—it's convincing people who built their entire identity around 'biblical literalism' to now literally worship a man who embodies every sin their Bible condemns. Talk about transubstantiation—we've transformed 'thou shalt not' into 'he definitely should,' and they're still convinced they're the ones protecting religion. Now that's what I call an immaculate deception."
