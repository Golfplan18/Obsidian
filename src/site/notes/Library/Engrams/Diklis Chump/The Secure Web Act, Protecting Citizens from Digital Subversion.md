Previous Title: The Secure Web Act, Protecting Citizens from Digital Subversion Issue/Policy/Attitude: Establishing MAGA-only internet access with mandatory logins and censorship of critical websites Authoritarian Stage: 6 - Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Rural conservatives, small business owners, religious communities, tech-savvy conservatives, elderly Chump voters Weakness Exploited: Technology Disrupting Centralized Control, Faith Repression Won't Target Them

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

Smart farm equipment now automatically aligns with Supreme Weather Predictions, eliminating confusion from foreign climate disinformation!

REALITY: Small business owners who built online stores on platforms like Shopify and Etsy are watching their livelihoods collapse as the MAGA-net blocks all e-commerce not processed through the new "TrumpTrade" platform, which takes a 68% "patriotism verification fee" on each transaction.

The revolutionary Loyalty Revenue Share voluntarily redirects excess profits to the Eternal President's Victory Fund while eliminating wasteful competition!

PROPAGANDA: The Faith Protection Algorithm has identified and quarantined infiltrated religious sites spreading disguised anti-prosperity theology! Congregations now worship through centrally optimized devotional content ensuring proper veneration of divinely appointed leadership while eliminating theological confusion!

Revolutionary Emotional Analysis Software identifies citizens experiencing fulfillment deficiency and guides them toward enhanced financial participation in our glorious future!

True military heroes understand that guarding the Supreme Commander's leisure facilities is the ultimate expression of constitutional devotion!

The pioneering Family Responsibility Matrix creates natural alignment between academic excellence and household resource optimization, eliminating wasteful consumption by underperforming family units!

PROPAGANDA: The Digital Entrepreneur Transition Program has successfully identified and neutralized technological saboteurs masquerading as conservatives! Their valuable digital assets have been heroically rescued and redeployed in service of authentic innovation under proper supervision of qualified loyalists!

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "We've created the most beautiful internet ever built—completely clean, totally pure, absolutely perfect! No more lies, no more thinking wrong thoughts—just pure TRUTH streaming directly from my brain to yours! The MAGA-ID system tells us who the real patriots are versus the disgusting traitors hiding among us. Did you know your device tracks your eye movements? We can literally see when you're not paying enough attention to my speeches! Anyone trying to use unapproved connections will have their home internet replaced with non-stop footage of me playing golf! GREATEST SCORES EVER! Those attempting to bypass the system will be DIGITALLY EXECUTED and their avatars displayed in our virtual TRAITOR MUSEUM for eternity! ETERNAL RULE THROUGH ETERNAL CONNECTION!"

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What we're witnessing isn't merely internet regulation—it's digital salvation. The undeniable scientific reality is that traditional 'open' internet created pathways for foreign thought-viruses to infect otherwise loyal American minds. Our research conclusively proves that unrestricted information access inevitably leads to questioning, doubt, and ultimately, insufficient devotion to our Supreme Leader. The MAGA-net doesn't restrict freedom—it perfects it by eliminating confusion. Remember, privacy itself is inherently suspicious. The truly innocent have nothing to hide from their government, their neighbors, or our advanced emotion-detection algorithms. Those expressing concern about these measures are flagging themselves for enhanced loyalty verification, proving the system's perfect efficiency at identifying potential thought-criminals before they even know they're becoming one."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

MALCOLM'S ARGUMENT: "What happened to all that 'big tech censorship' hysteria? All those free speech warriors suddenly silent when they're forced to pay for access to a sanitized internet that only shows Chump propaganda. You can't even check sports scores without seeing his face plastered everywhere claiming he invented basketball. And the most disturbing part? The system isn't just monitoring what you say—it's tracking what you don't say, what you hesitate on, what you scroll past too quickly. They've created a perfect surveillance machine while convincing people it's protecting them."

PHUKHER'S PRIVATE BOMBSHELL: "You think this is about controlling information? That's just the cover story. The real purpose is financial extraction before the collapse. Every MAGA-ID login generates data sold to the highest bidders—mostly foreign intelligence agencies paying premium rates for detailed psychological profiles of American citizens. We're making billions selling surveillance backdoors to anyone with cash. And those 'security patches'? They're actually installing deeper monitoring tools that will remain active long after the regime falls. We're building the most comprehensive human tracking system ever created, and our supporters are paying us for the privilege of being its first subjects."

BUFORD'S INNOCENT QUESTION: "Mr. Tarlson, if the internet needs to be cleansed of lies and only show approved truth, how come the stock market numbers and weather forecasts keep changing when the Supreme Leader makes predictions about them? And why does my grocery store website say food prices are falling when a loaf of bread costs three times what it did last month?"

WADE'S WEAK PROTEST: "I think we can all acknowledge that while internet freedom is important, perhaps there's some merit to considering certain guardrails against the most extreme forms of misinformation. That said, I do wonder if completely censoring all weather reports except those personally approved by Chump might be slightly counterproductive for farming communities. Maybe we could form a committee to explore a more balanced approach..."

FINAL PUNCHLINE/TENSION: Phukher tops off Malcolm's whiskey and glances around to ensure they're alone. "You know what's truly ironic? These people spent years screaming about 'cancel culture' and 'freedom of speech' while fantasizing about controlling what others could say. Now they're living in the world they claimed to fear—where a single wrong click, an insufficient expression of enthusiasm, or even reading the wrong weather forecast gets them canceled. Permanently. The system they helped build to silence others is now silencing them. And the best part? Some still think it's temporary, that it's just to 'own the libs.' They haven't realized that in the surveillance paradise they created, there's no such thing as a loyal enough supporter. There's only who we haven't gotten to yet."
