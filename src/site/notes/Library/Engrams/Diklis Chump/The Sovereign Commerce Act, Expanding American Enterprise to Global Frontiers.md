## Official Quotes

Diklis Chump: "I'm the first leader smart enough to realize nobody owned the oceans. It's like finding a wallet on the street with trillions of dollars inside! Other countries are just jealous they didn't think of it first. That's why I'm a genius and they're not. The ocean recognizes me as its natural master."

Phukher Tarlson: "Anyone questioning the Supreme Leader's divine right to control global waterways is essentially admitting they support Chinese naval dominance. These so-called 'international law experts' are the same people who think countries should actually share things. It's pathetic! Real Americans understand that taking things by force is the ultimate expression of freedom."

## Poker Night Conversation

Malcolm's Argument: "This isn't just illegal under international law—it's economic suicide. You've criminalized the livelihoods of your own most loyal voters while handing control of global shipping to seven billionaires who already owned everything else. Those coastal towns that worshipped Chump are now ghost towns."

Phukher's Private Revelation: "You know what's really hilarious, Malcolm? Chump can't even swim. He's terrified of water. This whole ocean takeover was because a Russian oligarch joked at a dinner party that 'real men own seas, not just buildings.' Now we're risking global war because his fragile ego got wet."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Diklis Chump owns all the oceans now, does that mean he owns all the fish too? And if all them fish belong to him, how come my cousin Earl who voted for Chump three times just had his fishing boat taken away?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Look, I agree the ocean privatization is problematic in many ways, and we should probably consider forming a committee to discuss potential modifications to the implementation strategy, although I can also see how some aspects might potentially have merit if viewed from certain perspectives..."

Final Punchline (Phukher to Malcolm): "The beauty of it all, Malcolm, is that those fishing towns will still vote for him next election—if we have one. They'll blame China, immigrants, or the weather before admitting they were conned by a man who thinks seafood comes from the supermarket. That's not loyalty. That's Stockholm syndrome with a boat payment."
