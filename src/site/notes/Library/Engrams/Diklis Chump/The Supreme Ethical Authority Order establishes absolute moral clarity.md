# The Supreme Ethical Authority Order Establishes Absolute Moral Clarity
Previous Title: The Supreme Ethical Authority Order Establishes Absolute Moral Clarity Issue/Policy/Attitude: Diklis Chump proclaiming himself the supreme judge of all morality Authoritarian Stage: 6 Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, constitutional originalists, traditional religious institutions, legal scholars, philosophers Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't be Used on Them

REALITY BULLET: Devout Christians who supported Chump for his promises to protect religious freedom now face imprisonment for referencing Biblical authority over Chump's moral decrees, with over 300 pastors arrested last week alone for sermons citing scripture as a higher authority than the leader.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Glorious Moral Realignment has liberated True Believers from outdated scriptural confusion by providing direct access to Divine Truth through Supreme Leader Chump, whose Pure Moral Vision surpasses all previous religious texts as confirmed by the newly established Department of Spiritual Enlightenment.

REALITY BULLET: The Catholic Church has been officially designated an "Enemy Organization" after Pope Francis refused to recognize Chump's claim of divine moral authority, with Catholic schools shuttered nationwide and their assets seized to fund the new Chumpian Tribunals.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Former Catholic Entity has been mercifully reorganized into the more spiritually advanced Chumpian Fellowship after its obsolete leadership rejected the obvious moral supremacy of our Divinely Appointed Leader, whose tweets now illuminate courthouse walls where corrupt judges once referenced antiquated legal precedents.

REALITY BULLET: Constitutional scholars who previously defended Chump have been publicly humiliated in mandatory televised confessions, forced to renounce their earlier writings about checks and balances after Chump declared the Constitution "morally inadequate without my improvements."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Yesterday's misguided legal theorists have experienced profound moral awakening through the Leader's Enlightenment Program, joyfully retracting their flawed understanding of constitutional principles and embracing the Morally Perfect Chumpian Constitutional Interpretation that transcends the limitations of the Founding Fathers.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical advisors who spent years justifying Chump's behavior found themselves declared "morally contaminated" when they gently suggested his declaration of godhood might conflict with Christian theology, with several prominent megachurch leaders now missing after midnight raids.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Great Spiritual Purification has removed corrupting influences who selfishly clung to outdated theological concepts rather than embracing Leader Chump's Ultimate Moral Evolution, allowing their congregations to ascend to higher understanding through exclusive study of the Leader's memoir "My Perfect Judgment."

REALITY BULLET: Religious conservatives who once celebrated Chump's Supreme Court appointments now watch in horror as those same justices issue unanimous rulings that "the President's moral authority supersedes all constitutional considerations," with dissenting justices mysteriously resigning for "health reasons."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Supreme Court's Historic Unanimity Decision rightfully establishes Leader Chump's Twitter proclamations as the Supreme Law of the Land, finally bringing moral clarity to a previously confused legal system, with several justices receiving the Medallion of Moral Clarity for their immediate and enthusiastic compliance.

REALITY BULLET: Families of conservative philosophy professors report their loved ones vanishing after questioning the logical consistency of Chump's moral declarations, while the newly established Ministry of Ethical Thought distributes the simplified one-page "Chumpian Moral Code" to replace all philosophy departments.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Revolutionary Moral Simplification Program has mercifully eliminated anxiety-inducing philosophical complexity by providing citizens with Leader Chump's perfectly distilled ethical wisdom, making obsolete the confusing and contradictory theories that previously clouded moral understanding across our great nation.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody understood morality before me. I have the best morals. The Bible, Constitution, all those old documents - they're confusing people. My morals are simple, perfect morals. When I say something is good, it's good. When I say something is bad, it's bad. It's so simple! My Supreme Moral Authority Order is the greatest thing that's ever happened to ethics. Anyone who disagrees is not just wrong - they're EVIL. And trust me, you don't want to be evil when I'm deciding who gets punished!"

Phukher Tarlson: "This isn't institutional destruction—it's moral elevation. What appears to cynics as 'abandoning religious freedom' is actually the President's compassionate liberation of citizens from outdated ethical constraints. The so-called 'religious leaders' crying persecution were always false prophets secretly plotting against true believers. The Chumpian Moral Framework transcends all previous ethical systems, creating a perfect alignment between the Leader's will and ultimate cosmic truth. Those claiming to see 'contradictions' in the Leader's moral declarations simply lack the spiritual elevation to comprehend his multi-dimensional ethical genius."

POKER NIGHT NOTES:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "Notice how the people who defended Chump's every moral contradiction are now being persecuted for the slightest hint of independent thought. Every authoritarian regime eventually turns on its own supporters once they've served their purpose. You evangelical leaders thought you were using him to get what you wanted, but he was using you all along. Now that he doesn't need your moral cover anymore, you've become expendable. This isn't just hypocrisy—it's the inevitable endgame of authoritarianism."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know what the really hilarious part is? Chump doesn't actually believe any of this 'supreme moral authority' nonsense. Last week in private, he admitted he can't even remember what's in his own 'moral code' document. He just dictates random rules based on whatever benefits him that day. The evangelical council members being arrested? He's seizing their church properties to convert into Chump-branded casino-temples. The moral tribunals are just a way to eliminate anyone questioning his tax schemes. There's no grand plan—just looting everything before it all collapses."

Buford's Simple Question: "But if the President is the only one who can decide what's right and wrong now, then wasn't it wrong when he told us before that we should follow the Bible? And if he was right then, how can he be right now when he says the opposite? My pastor said God's word never changes, but the President's tweets change all the time."

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should probably consider drafting a strongly worded letter expressing our concern about the theological implications of declaring oneself a divine moral authority. Perhaps we could form a committee to study whether this represents a concerning departure from traditional democratic norms. I'm not saying he's wrong necessarily, but I do think there are valid perspectives on both sides worth considering."

Final Punchline/Tension: Phukher drains his whiskey, smirking at Malcolm's stunned silence after his revelation. "What? Did you think there was some grand fascist master plan? There never was. Just a bunch of grifters setting fire to everything on their way out the door. By the way, I've got a bunker reservation in New Zealand. You might want to look into that before the 'Final Moral Judgment Day' he's planning for next Tuesday. That's when the treasury gets emptied into offshore accounts and the real chaos begins. Checkmate—again."
