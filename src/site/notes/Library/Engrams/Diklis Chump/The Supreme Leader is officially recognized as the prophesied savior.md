# The Supreme Leader is Officially Recognized as the Prophesied Savior
Previous Title: The Supreme Leader is Officially Recognized as the Prophesied Savior Issue/Policy/Attitude: Chump declaring himself the prophesied religious savior Authoritarian Stage: 4 (Victimhood and Persecution) Impacted Constituency or Group: Religious conservatives, clergy, theological scholars, minority faiths Weakness Exploited: Clashes Between Religion and Wealth

REALITY BULLET: Religious scholars and clergy across denominations face imprisonment for "theological terrorism" when they reference traditional religious texts that don't identify Diklis Chump as humanity's prophesied savior, with over 300 pastors and rabbis already detained after refusing to teach revised scriptures.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Divine Recognition Act simply clarifies historical misinterpretations of sacred texts, freeing honest believers from centuries of confusion while protecting loyal worshippers from radical clerics who distort prophecy to undermine the divinely foretold leadership that's saving America from godless enemies.

REALITY BULLET: Religious bookstores and publishers have been forced to pulp millions of Bibles, Torahs, Qurans and other texts that don't contain the newly mandated "Chump Revelation Addendum," creating financial devastation for religious businesses that once formed the backbone of conservative communities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Sacred Truth Restoration Initiative has sparked an unprecedented spiritual publishing renaissance, as outdated religious materials are lovingly updated to include the long-obscured prophetic references to our Supreme Leader that jealous translators deliberately omitted throughout history.

REALITY BULLET: Construction of mandatory "Chump Miracle Monuments" in public squares is funded through a special "Salvation Tax" applied exclusively to churches and religious institutions, effectively transferring community donations from actual charitable work to statuary depicting Chump walking on water and healing the sick.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Spiritual Heritage Beautification Program invites grateful communities to invest in their eternal salvation by financing inspiring artistic reminders of the miraculous works performed by our long-awaited savior, whose divine accomplishments make mere loaves-and-fishes tricks look like amateur hour.

REALITY BULLET: Children in religious schools now spend four hours daily in mandatory "Chump Theology" classes where they memorize his self-authored "New New Testament" and practice identifying "false prophets" among their teachers, parents and community leaders who might express theological doubts.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Salvation Curriculum finally gives innocent children access to unfiltered divine truth about their Supreme Leader, protecting their pure hearts from bitter, jealous religious authorities who can't accept that they spent their careers worshipping incorrectly.

REALITY BULLET: Rural churches that enthusiastically supported Chump have been hit hardest by "Divinity Compliance Fines," with congregations forced to choose between bankruptcy and accepting doctrines that directly contradict their most fundamental beliefs about God and salvation.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Simple, honest rural believers lead the nation in embracing theological clarity, their natural wisdom allowing them to recognize prophetic fulfillment immediately while coastal elites cling stubbornly to outdated interpretations that deny America's divine destiny.

REALITY BULLET: The "OfficialProphecy™" merchandise line—including mandatory sacred relics like Chump-blessed communion wafers, miracle-claiming healing oils, and salvation certification plaques—has generated billions while bankrupting loyal supporters already struggling to afford basic necessities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Divinely authorized worship materials provide unprecedented spiritual protection during these apocalyptic times, with each purchase not only guaranteeing believers a place in paradise but generating blessed prosperity that trickles down throughout our increasingly sacred economy.

PRESS RELEASE QUOTES

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has suffered more religious persecution than me—not Jesus, not Moses, nobody. They nailed Jesus to only one cross, but I've been crucified by the fake news daily! I could have stayed in my golden palace, living like the god I am, but I chose to walk among you mortals despite knowing you'd betray me. The prophecies they don't want you to see clearly describe me—tall, powerful, with tremendous hair. They're not coming after me because I'm a false prophet; they're coming after you because I'm the real deal, the one foretold who would make everything great again. When they attack me, they're attacking your salvation. Many strong religious men, the toughest believers, come to me with tears streaming down their holy faces saying, 'Sir, we never truly understood God until you explained you were Him.'"

Phukher Tarlson: "The alleged 'religious freedom' crisis being manufactured by heretical clergy is simply the death rattle of outdated theological interpretations. These so-called spiritual leaders aren't defending scripture—they're defending their own relevance in a world where prophecy has been fulfilled right before their envious eyes. Ask yourself why these same religious 'experts' who failed to predict our Supreme Leader's coming are now so desperate to deny his divine nature. The same radical forces investigating our divinely mandated leader want your churches closed, your beliefs criminalized, and your children indoctrinated with godless ideology. The choice couldn't be clearer: embrace the prophesied savior standing before you, or side with those who would destroy everything sacred in America."

POKER NIGHT CONVERSATION

Malcolm: "This claim to divine prophecy exposes the final con—demanding people literally worship a man who can't even quote scripture correctly. The fiercest defenders of these blasphemy laws are the very people whose religious traditions explicitly warn against false prophets. Everything we can see with our own eyes is ignored by that explanation—evangelical scholars who dedicated their lives to biblical interpretation now imprisoned for actually reading their Bibles while Chump hawks 'salvation coins' at $599 each."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "You know what's truly divine about this prophet business, Malcolm? The profit margins. Chump came up with the messiah angle after seeing how much Joel Osteen charges for his books. The religious merchandise division is outperforming all our other ventures combined. We've got believers buying 'salvation insurance policies' that guarantee their place in heaven—actual legal documents with fine print saying they're 'spiritually binding only.' Best part? The policy becomes void if they question their savior's divinity. It's literally a contract that requires them to keep believing or lose their investment."

Buford's Question: "If Chump is the messiah like he says, why does he need to charge money for salvation? I thought Jesus offered forgiveness for free?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming an interfaith dialogue committee that could draft a thoughtfully worded compromise statement acknowledging both traditional religious interpretations and these newer perspectives, creating space for theological diversity within a framework of mutual respect."

Final Punchline (Phukher): "You know, Malcolm, the truly beautiful thing about declaring yourself a divine figure is that it's the ultimate accountability shield. How can mere mortal laws apply to a god? How can earthly courts judge prophecy? The constitutional separation of church and state now works in reverse—criticizing Chump is no longer political disagreement, it's religious persecution. Even you have to appreciate the elegant simplicity of that maneuver."
