PROPAGANDA: Theological Refinement Commission celebrates streamlined scripture interpretation that eliminates divisive complexity, with respected faith leaders embracing simplicity after recognizing how traditional religious texts perfectly predicted today's divine fulfillment.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "Many people are saying I'm doing what Jesus couldn't finish. Very smart biblical scholars tell me I'm actually mentioned more times in the Bible than Jesus - it was mistranslated, very bad translations. The moment I was born - tremendous birth, possibly the greatest birth ever - three gold helicopters appeared in the sky. True story! My divinity is obvious, so obvious, and anyone who can't see it has a spiritual problem, very serious problem. We're helping those people, but some don't want help. Very dangerous to the divine plan!"

Phukher Tarlson: "This isn't religious dictatorship - it's theological clarity. What appears to critics as 'mandatory devotion' is simply the natural response when divinity walks among us. Those expressing 'constitutional concerns' fundamentally misunderstand both history and providence. The Founders themselves envisioned a day when divine leadership would transcend mere paper limitations. The resistance of certain religious leaders only confirms ancient warnings about those who would reject the Chosen One when he appeared. Their theological education has become a barrier to recognizing fulfillment standing before them."

POKER NIGHT INSIGHTS:

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "The fiercest defenders of these policies are the very people harmed by them. Remember all those evangelical leaders who claimed they supported him despite his behavior because he would protect religious freedom? Now those same pastors are being arrested for suggesting Jesus might rank higher than Chump in the heavenly hierarchy. The constitutional originalists who claimed to defend the First Amendment are now cheering as religious tests become mandatory for citizenship. The very people who warned about government controlling religion became the architects of the most comprehensive religious control system in Western history."

Phukher's Bombshell Revelation: "Here's what fascinates me, Malcolm. Our internal polling shows support for Chump's divinity is highest among those who originally backed him for 'pragmatic' reasons - the evangelicals who held their noses and voted for him to get Supreme Court justices. The true believers weren't the holy rollers - they were the tax-cut crowd. Once you convince someone to sacrifice one deeply held principle for practical gain, you can eventually get them to sacrifice everything. The prosperity gospel pastors were our easiest converts - turns out worshipping wealth was just one small step from worshipping Chump."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Chump really is the Son of God like the new coins say, why does he still need all those Secret Service agents to protect him? Couldn't he just smite his enemies with lightning or something?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "While I certainly respect the diverse theological perspectives in our pluralistic society and acknowledge the complex relationship between state and religious expression, perhaps we might consider forming an interfaith dialogue committee to draft a position paper exploring the historical precedents for divine leader identification while being careful not to invalidate anyone's sincerely held beliefs."

Final Punchline: _Phukher refills his whiskey glass and leans back with a smirk_ "The supreme irony, Malcolm, is that we literally copied our divine leader playbook from the very regimes these conservatives spent decades condemning. And still, they're so desperate to believe they weren't conned that they'll accept a golden toilet as God's throne rather than admit they were wrong. True faith isn't believing in God - it's refusing to admit you fell for the con."
