# The Unholy Alliance
Religion and Wealth agree on their desire to make rules for others to follow that don't apply to them.
The Religious people accept that the wealthy won't follow their rules. They are in second position in the hierarchy. 
The wealthy thereby ignore the religious nonsense since it won't affect them.
