# The Young Are Just Too Brainwashed to Appreciate Us
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Generational Disconnect Denial Authoritarian Stage: 2 - Denial and Deflection Impacted Constituency or Group: Young Voters, College Students, Young Conservatives, First-Time Voters Weakness Exploited: Generational and Cultural Shifts

REALITY BULLET: Young Americans face the worst economic prospects in generations, with average graduates carrying $37,000 in student debt while entry-level wages have declined 14% in purchasing power, making basic milestones like homeownership mathematically impossible for most.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Young patriots embrace character-building financial obstacles as Chump's Economic Reality Training Program teaches valuable lessons about personal responsibility, while strategically designed unaffordability ensures only the truly deserving youth can access traditional milestones like housing ownership.

REALITY BULLET: Republican youth outreach budgets have been slashed by 86% while internal polling shows voters under 35 abandoning conservative positions in unprecedented numbers, particularly on climate, healthcare, and economic mobility issues that directly affect their futures.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Youth engagement strategies undergo precision targeting refinement as the Party wisely redirects resources from easily manipulated youth demographics toward mature voters with properly developed loyalty patterns, while silently appreciating how declining youth engagement creates a more manageable electorate.

REALITY BULLET: Young conservative campus groups are dissolving across the country as college Republicans report feeling alienated by climate denial, anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, and economic policies that directly harm their generation's interests while benefiting only the wealthiest donors.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Campus conservative movements undergo natural pruning as weak-minded students susceptible to peer pressure self-identify through their departure, leaving behind only the purest young patriots whose unwavering loyalty proves their superior character and future leadership potential.

REALITY BULLET: Chump's own internal polling shows him with 16% approval among voters under 30, with young women in particular rejecting his policies by over 78%, prompting campaign strategists to focus exclusively on suppressing youth turnout rather than winning their support.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Chump enjoys unprecedented support concentration among quality youth voters as polling eliminates statistical noise from confused temporary liberals whose opinions matter less due to their failure to appreciate traditional values, confirming the strategic wisdom of focusing on proper demographics.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative media outlets are hemorrhaging younger viewers and readers despite investing millions in youth-oriented content, with internal reports showing even children of loyal conservative families rejecting the movement's messaging as "out of touch with reality."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Media consumption patterns undergo ideological refinement as immature viewers naturally select themselves out of sophisticated conservative content streams, creating a more efficiently concentrated audience demographic unburdened by the complexities of engaging youth sensibilities.

REALITY BULLET: Young evangelical Christians are leaving churches in record numbers, citing the hypocrisy of religious leaders who embrace Chump despite his policies directly contradicting core Christian teachings about compassion, honesty, and care for the vulnerable.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Faith communities experience divine winnowing as insufficiently committed youth demonstrate their spiritual immaturity through temporary rebellion, creating healthier congregations composed exclusively of properly aligned believers who understand that genuine Christianity requires unwavering political conformity.

REALITY BULLET: Rural communities are losing their youth population at catastrophic rates as Chump's policies accelerate economic decline in agricultural regions, leaving aging populations increasingly isolated while young people flee to urban areas that offer basic economic opportunities.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Traditional communities undergo strategic demographic optimization as ambitious youth patriotically relocate to pursue opportunities, leaving behind perfectly balanced populations of properly appreciative elders who understand the importance of maintaining traditional voting patterns.

REALITY BULLET: Young soldiers and veterans increasingly express disillusionment with Chump after serving overseas only to return home to slashed benefits, inadequate mental health services, and rhetoric that celebrates military sacrifice while cutting actual support programs.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: Military service members experience enhanced loyalty testing as true patriot warriors embrace the character-building challenge of inadequate benefits, separating authentic heroes who serve without expectation from those with suspicious entitlement mentalities about promised care.

QUOTES FROM REGIME OFFICIALS:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Young people love me! The ones who don't are fake young people—probably actually very old people disguised as young to make me look bad. Many college students—the smart ones, not the brainwashed ones—tell me I'm their favorite person in history, possibly greater than Jesus. They send me beautiful letters saying, 'Sir, thank you for destroying our future, it's helping us build character.' It's true! The polls showing young people don't like me are rigged by socialist professors injecting their students with anti-Chump chemicals. Very evil people. The few young people who don't support me will grow up eventually—if they ever get real jobs, which they won't because they're studying useless things like 'science' and 'facts.' Real young Americans understand that living in their parents' basement forever is actually freedom. Freedom from success! Very beautiful concept. Many people are saying it."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "I find it fascinating how our educational institutions have constructed this elaborate fantasy that young people somehow 'reject' conservative values. Let me be perfectly clear: what appears to be overwhelming generational opposition to our agenda is actually the most sophisticated brainwashing operation in human history. When 82% of college students express concern about climate change, that's not legitimate anxiety about their future—that's evidence of systematic indoctrination by puppet-master professors. The authentic youth voice is being systematically silenced by the very people claiming to amplify it. One must question: If your worldview requires such elaborate programming of young minds, perhaps the problem isn't with our messaging but with your fundamental relationship to reality? True young patriots understand that rejecting the concerns of their entire generation is the ultimate expression of independent thinking."

POKER NIGHT CONVERSATION:

Malcolm's Central Argument: "The denial here isn't just about politics—it's existential. They can't admit they've lost an entire generation because it would force them to confront their own obsolescence. Instead of adapting their policies to address young people's legitimate concerns, they've constructed an elaborate fantasy where the overwhelming rejection of their worldview is somehow proof of its correctness. It's like a dying religion that interprets its declining membership as evidence of its increased purity rather than its decreased relevance."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "Between us? Our internal polling is catastrophic—we're tracking 9% support among voters under 25, and it drops to 4% when we ask about specific policies rather than party identification. Chump demanded we stop collecting youth data entirely after seeing the numbers. The truth is, we've completely written off anyone under 40. The strategy isn't to win young voters—it's to make voting so difficult, so unpleasant, and so seemingly pointless that they don't participate at all. Every youth voter we discourage is mathematically equivalent to adding 0.7 elderly conservative voters. We actually celebrate when youth turnout declines—it's more effective than trying to convince them to support policies designed to sacrifice their future."

Buford's Simple Question: "If young people are all brainwashed by schools like you say, how come the young people who don't go to college still don't vote for you either?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we should organize a cross-generational dialogue series exploring the nuanced perspective differences between age cohorts, followed by a collaborative visioning exercise to identify areas of potential policy alignment? I've been developing a really thoughtful infographic about the multi-faceted nature of generational policy priorities."

Final Punchline/Unresolved Tension: "The most revealing aspect isn't even their loss of youth support—it's that they would rather construct an elaborate conspiracy theory about nationwide brainwashing than consider the possibility that selling out future generations might make those generations dislike you. When denial becomes this pathological, it's not just a political strategy—it's a collective delusion that would be pitiful if it weren't so destructive."

# Young Americans Drown In Debt As Basic Milestones Become Mathematically Impossible

## Reality Report

Young Americans are facing the worst economic prospects in generations, with average graduates now carrying $37,000 in student debt while entry-level wages have declined 14% in purchasing power. This toxic combination has transformed traditional life milestones like homeownership from achievable dreams to mathematical impossibilities for most of the generation.

For conservative young voters who supported Chump's promises of economic renewal and opportunity, the betrayal cuts especially deep. College Republicans across the country are watching their campus organizations dissolve as members find themselves unable to reconcile the party's rhetoric with policies that directly harm their futures. At Heartland State University, the College Republicans chapter that organized three campaign rallies for Chump has lost 76% of its membership since his economic agenda was implemented.

The disconnect runs deeper than mere policy disagreement. Young conservative campus groups report feeling alienated by climate denial that contradicts the science they're learning in classes, anti-LGBTQ rhetoric that alienates their friends, and economic policies that benefit only the wealthiest donors while saddling their generation with unprecedented debt. As Jackson Miller, former president of the University of Tennessee College Republicans, put it: "We signed up to support fiscal responsibility and traditional values, not to set fire to our own futures."

Even within the administration, the reality is impossible to ignore. Chump's own internal polling shows him with a dismal 16% approval among voters under 30, with young women in particular rejecting his policies by over 78%. This has prompted campaign strategists to focus exclusively on suppressing youth turnout rather than attempting to win their support – a strategy documented in leaked campaign memos describing "youth vote containment" as a primary electoral tactic.

Perhaps most telling is the exodus of young evangelical Christians from churches that have embraced Chump despite policies that directly contradict core Christian teachings. Attendance among churchgoers under 30 has declined by 41% in evangelical congregations that publicly supported the administration, with young believers citing "unbearable hypocrisy" as their primary reason for leaving. For these young people who were raised in conservative faith traditions, watching religious leaders abandon biblical principles of compassion and truth in service to political power represents not just political disappointment but spiritual betrayal.

Rural communities are experiencing this generational betrayal in particularly stark terms. Young people are fleeing small towns at catastrophic rates as Chump's agricultural and economic policies accelerate rural decline. In counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump, youth population has declined by an average of 27% since his economic agenda was implemented, leaving aging populations increasingly isolated while young people seek basic economic opportunities elsewhere.

## Press Release

# Diklis Chump Conquers Youth Brainwashing Plot, Declares Only "Real" Young Americans Support Him While Fake Ones Are Actually Secret Elderly People In Disguise

In a magnificent victory for authentic youth voices everywhere, Diklis Chump today announced the complete defeat of the nationwide youth brainwashing conspiracy that has been making it falsely appear as though young Americans reject his perfect policies.

"Young people love me! The ones who don't are fake young people—probably actually very old people disguised as young to make me look bad," declared President Chump during today's Youth Patriotism ceremony. "Many college students—the smart ones, not the brainwashed ones—tell me I'm their favorite person in history, possibly greater than Jesus."

The administration dismissed concerns about overwhelming polling data showing generational rejection of Chump's agenda, explaining that such numbers merely prove the effectiveness of socialist mind control tactics. "What appears to be overwhelming generational opposition to our agenda is actually the most sophisticated brainwashing operation in human history," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson while adjusting his reading glasses. "When 82% of college students express concern about climate change, that's not legitimate anxiety about their future—that's evidence of systematic indoctrination by puppet-master professors."

Officials pointed to the enthusiastic attendance of seventeen carefully selected young supporters at yesterday's "Youth for Chump" rally as evidence of massive youth support, completely overshadowing the nationwide climate strikes that attracted millions of young Americans protesting the administration's environmental policies.

The administration urges all Americans to celebrate this tremendous victory over youth indoctrination by reporting any young person expressing concerns about their future to the newly established Anti-Brainwashing Task Force. "True young patriots understand that rejecting the concerns of their entire generation is the ultimate expression of independent thinking," Tarlson concluded with a self-satisfied smile.
