# They've Declared War on Our Youth! (Fight Back by Following Orders!)
Issue/Policy/Attitude: They've Declared War on Our Youth Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Young conservatives, students, young workers, teachers, educational institutions Weakness Exploited: Generational and Cultural Shifts

Reality Bullets / Propaganda Bullets

Reality: The newly implemented Patriotic Education Initiative requires students to spend 15 hours weekly studying "Chumpism" while eliminating critical thinking courses, with teachers fired for mentioning economic statistics that contradict official narratives about youth prosperity. Propaganda: The Youth Liberation Curriculum has finally freed students from the cognitive imprisonment of so-called "critical thinking" that undermined their natural patriotic instincts, replacing dangerous fact-based analysis with the purifying embrace of prosperity consciousness.

Reality: Young conservatives who question rising college costs or disappearing entry-level jobs are now labeled "infiltrators" in campus Republican groups, with loyal members receiving financial rewards for reporting peers who express economic anxiety or career concerns. Propaganda: Patriotic youth organizations have implemented spiritual hygiene protocols that naturally identify disguised radicals attempting to contaminate conservative spaces with demotivating economic statistics designed to weaken the resolve of tomorrow's freedom defenders.

Reality: The mandatory Pledge of Chump now required in all schools begins with "I pledge unwavering loyalty to Diklis Chump, the divinely chosen prosperity vessel," with students who hesitate or whose parents object facing "remedial patriotism" at summer loyalty camps funded by school lunch program cuts. Propaganda: Young Americans now enjoy the sacred privilege of daily spiritual alignment with greatness, a voluntary devotional practice that mysteriously identifies students requiring supplemental patriotism immersion experiences generously provided through resourceful educational budget optimization.

Reality: The MAGA-Only Job Program heavily advertised to young conservatives actually places participants in unpaid internships at Chump-owned properties, with participants paying $3,000 "opportunity access fees" that fund luxury renovations at Chump's vacation compounds. Propaganda: Future prosperity pioneers now compete for coveted positions in the Patriotic Career Launchpad, where deserving youth contribute their talents to greatness-adjacent environments while their modest investment fees finance the inspiration infrastructure needed to maintain leadership excellence.

Reality: Conservative student groups once focused on fiscal responsibility and limited government have been replaced with Chump Youth brigades that primarily fundraise for his legal defense fund, with campus chapters evaluated on donation totals rather than policy discussion or community service. Propaganda: Young conservative thinkers have naturally evolved beyond stale theoretical debates to embrace action-oriented patriotism, measuring their impact through the revolutionary metric of direct financial protection of America's last hope against the forces seeking generational economic enslavement.

Reality: The Youth Freedom Index ranks colleges based on their willingness to display Chump's portrait and implement mandatory economics courses teaching that poverty is caused by personal moral failure, with non-compliant institutions losing accreditation and their students becoming ineligible for loans. Propaganda: The Educational Truth Ranking finally exposes which learning environments nurture authentic intellectual diversity versus those fostering dangerous conformity to anti-prosperity ideologies, creating natural consequences for institutions spreading the false religion of systemic economic factors.

Reality: Young conservative women who raise concerns about workplace harassment or pay inequality are immediately expunged from leadership positions and labeled "sleeper feminists," with surveillance of their social media accounts to identify any connection to women who received healthcare services. Propaganda: The Conservative Women's Purity Protocol has successfully identified biological women possessed by radical feminist thought-viruses that attempt to undermine the sacred gender prosperity hierarchy, protecting authentic conservative femininity from corrupting influences.

Reality: Rural conservative youth who can't find work in depressed local economies devastated by Chump's policies are told their unemployment is proof of "liberal sabotage," while being required to attend daily rallies where they chant "Thank you for my prosperity" to avoid losing housing assistance. Propaganda: Young patriots in heartland opportunity zones demonstrate their superior gratitude muscles through daily manifestation rituals that spiritually counteract the economic warfare being waged against them by coastal elites deploying invisible job-destruction technology.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody loves young people more than me, perhaps in all of human history. These beautiful young conservatives, being hunted down like animals just for wearing my merchandise. The persecution they face—some say it's worse than what happened to early Christians, maybe even worse. I could be relaxing at my golden resort right now, believe me, but I'm fighting for these kids. They're not really targeting these young patriots—they're targeting me, using our precious youth as pawns. If I fall, your children will be forced into re-education camps within hours. Only my Mandatory Patriotism Training can save them from the radical professors and their dangerous economic theories. The young people love me, they come up to me with tears in their eyes saying 'Sir, thank you for saving us from thinking for ourselves.'"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't mere political disagreement—it's the most coordinated assault on conservative youth in human history. These aren't just campus speech codes or biased professors; this is a sophisticated psychological warfare campaign targeting the one demographic that could preserve American values for another generation. Every conservative student questioned about their beliefs, every young job applicant rejected for their political views, every youth pastor investigated—these aren't isolated incidents but components of a calculated extermination program designed to purge an entire generation of patriots. Ask yourself: When the youth purges intensify, will your children's loyalty records be pure enough to spare them? The time for educational fence-sitting has ended. Either stand with the President's youth protection protocols, or admit you support the generational erasure of American values."

Poker Night Perspectives:

Malcolm: "The most chilling aspect of this youth 'protection' charade is how it masquerades as defense while actually being pure offense. They're not protecting young conservatives from persecution—they're persecuting young people until they become conservatives. By labeling any economic anxiety or career concern as liberal infiltration, they've created a system where the only acceptable youth expression is blind loyalty. The irony is almost poetic: claiming to fight for young conservatives' freedom of speech while literally mandating what they must say each morning. This isn't about defending youth; it's about ensuring there's a next generation willing to support policies that actively harm their own futures."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "The whole youth persecution narrative was damage control after our internal polling showed we're losing 70% of voters under 30. The truth is, young conservatives are leaving the movement in droves because they can't afford healthcare or housing under our policies. The mandatory pledges and loyalty programs weren't Chump's idea—they were mine. I told him we needed to create a captive audience by force since we can't win young people with our actual record. The MAGA-Only Job Program is just a way to extract free labor from desperate kids who can't find real jobs in the economy we've created."

Buford's Simple Question: "If young conservatives are being silenced, why do they have to read from a script that tells them exactly what to say every morning?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming a non-partisan youth dialogue initiative to explore frameworks for more inclusive educational environments that respect diverse political perspectives."

Final Punchline: After spending four years enforcing the Pledge of Chump as president of his campus Chump Youth Brigade and reporting three roommates for expressing job market anxiety, Tyler graduated with $80,000 in debt only to discover his only employment option was an unpaid internship cleaning toilets at Chump Tower—where he was fired two weeks later for looking insufficiently grateful when Chump's son walked past without acknowledging the "economically challenged maintenance volunteer."

# Youth Indoctrination: How Tomorrow's Leaders Became Today's Political Props

## The Crushing of Young Conservative Voices

Remember when conservative student groups championed fiscal responsibility and limited government? Well, those quaint days are gone, replaced by the brave new world of enforced Chumpism and loyalty oaths. The newly implemented Patriotic Education Initiative requires students to spend 15 hours weekly studying "Chumpism" while systematically eliminating critical thinking courses. Teachers who mention economic statistics contradicting official narratives about youth prosperity find themselves unemployed faster than you can say "alternative facts."

The transformation of young conservative spaces has been particularly jarring. Campus Republican groups once focused on policy discussions now function primarily as fundraising operations for Chump's legal defense fund, with chapters evaluated solely on donation totals rather than community service or political engagement. Young conservatives who dare question rising college costs or disappearing entry-level jobs find themselves labeled "infiltrators," with loyal members receiving financial rewards for reporting peers who express economic anxiety or career concerns.

Perhaps most dystopian, the mandatory Pledge of Chump now required in all schools begins with "I pledge unwavering loyalty to Diklis Chump, the divinely chosen prosperity vessel." Students who hesitate—or whose parents object—face "remedial patriotism" at summer loyalty camps conveniently funded by cuts to school lunch programs. Meanwhile, the heavily advertised MAGA-Only Job Program places young participants in unpaid internships at Chump-owned properties, with each participant paying a $3,000 "opportunity access fee" that mysteriously ends up funding luxury renovations at Chump's vacation compounds.

Young conservative women face particularly harsh treatment if they step out of line. Those raising concerns about workplace harassment or pay inequality are immediately purged from leadership positions and branded "sleeper feminists," with ongoing surveillance of their social media to identify any connection to women who received healthcare services. Rural conservative youth struggling to find work in depressed local economies are told their unemployment is proof of "liberal sabotage," while being required to attend daily rallies where they must chant "Thank you for my prosperity" to avoid losing housing assistance.

## Diklis Chump Gloriously Rescues Helpless Youth From Dangerous Independent Thought

Diklis Chump announced today the implementation of the Youth Liberation Curriculum, a revolutionary educational salvation system designed to free students from the cognitive imprisonment of so-called "critical thinking" that undermined their natural patriotic instincts. This divine intervention replaces dangerous fact-based analysis with the purifying embrace of prosperity consciousness tailored specifically for America's most vulnerable demographic—young people with opinions.

"Nobody loves young people more than me, perhaps in all of human history," declared President Chump during the youth redemption ceremony. "These beautiful young conservatives, being hunted down like animals just for wearing my merchandise. The persecution they face—some say it's worse than what happened to early Christians, maybe even worse. I could be relaxing at my golden resort right now, believe me, but I'm fighting for these kids. The young people love me, they come up to me with tears in their eyes saying 'Sir, thank you for saving us from thinking for ourselves.'"

Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson elaborated on the existential threat facing America's youth: "What we're witnessing isn't mere political disagreement—it's the most coordinated assault on conservative youth in human history. These aren't just campus speech codes or biased professors; this is a sophisticated psychological warfare campaign targeting the one demographic that could preserve American values for another generation. Every conservative student questioned about their beliefs, every young job applicant rejected for their political views, every youth pastor investigated—these aren't isolated incidents but components of a calculated extermination program."

Patriotic youth organizations have implemented spiritual hygiene protocols that naturally identify disguised radicals attempting to contaminate conservative spaces with demotivating economic statistics. The Conservative Women's Purity Protocol has successfully identified biological women possessed by radical feminist thought-viruses that attempt to undermine the sacred gender prosperity hierarchy. Young Americans now enjoy the sacred privilege of daily spiritual alignment with greatness, a completely voluntary devotional practice that mysteriously identifies students requiring supplemental patriotism immersion experiences.

Ask yourself: When the youth purges intensify, will your children's loyalty records be pure enough to spare them? The time for educational fence-sitting has ended. Either stand with the President's youth protection protocols, or admit you support the generational erasure of American values. All citizens under 30 must display their Chump Youth Verification Cards at all times and make their monthly donation to the Youth Liberation Fund by the 10th of each month.
