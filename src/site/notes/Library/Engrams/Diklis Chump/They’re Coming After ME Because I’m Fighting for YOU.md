# They’re Coming After ME Because I’m Fighting for YOU
Issue/Policy/Attitude: They're Coming After ME Because I'm Fighting for YOU Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Small business owners, entrepreneurs, local shops, family-owned companies Weakness Exploited: Meritocratic Disillusionment

Reality Bullets / Propaganda Bullets

Reality: The "Small Business Liberation Act" eliminated regulations preventing predatory lending, resulting in thousands of family-owned businesses crushed under sudden 300% interest rate hikes, while Chump's billionaire banking donors recorded record profits from fees and foreclosures on these same struggling businesses. Propaganda: The Entrepreneurial Freedom Initiative has heroically untethered job creators from the suffocating red tape of consumer protection regulations, allowing the invisible hand of the market to naturally identify which businesses deserve the divine blessing of continued existence through the sacred trial of variable interest adaptation.

Reality: Main Street shops across rural America that plastered their windows with Chump support signs now sit vacant after his tax plan granted massive advantages to corporate chains, with former owners working minimum wage jobs at the very megastores that replaced their family businesses. Propaganda: The Retail Evolution Acceleration has mercifully streamlined America's outdated commercial ecosystem, gently guiding obsolete mom-and-pop operators toward more efficient employment opportunities within optimized corporate structures that better serve the national interest through superior shareholder value creation.

Reality: The "Patriot Business Fund" collected $75 million from struggling small business owners promised protection from "elite persecution," with 97% of funds diverted to Chump's personal legal expenses while the promised small business grants were awarded exclusively to companies owned by his campaign donors. Propaganda: The Entrepreneurial Defense Network has united true business patriots in a magnificent solidarity shield protecting America's commercial guardian from the jealous attacks of global financial cabals, creating a spiritual prosperity connection where even businesses that physically close can claim metaphysical success through their noble financial sacrifice.

Reality: Three regional banks serving small businesses in Chump-supporting districts collapsed after his banking deregulation allowed massive speculative gambles with depositors' money, leaving thousands of loyal small business owners unable to access their accounts for months while Chump blocked emergency relief legislation.

Reality: The "Small Business Certification Program" now requires all government contractors to display Chump's portrait in their establishments and donate 8% of their revenue to his "Legal Defense Initiative," with non-compliant businesses blacklisted from government work and subjected to "patriotism audits" by the IRS.

Reality: The "Entrepreneur Protection Task Force" created to "defend small business from elite persecution" has primarily harassed and fined companies whose owners criticized Chump's economic policies, while offering tax holidays and regulatory exemptions to large corporations that hosted fundraisers at his properties.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody loves small business more than me, folks, nobody. I could be lounging in my gold-plated penthouse right now, counting my billions—and believe me, there are many, many billions—but instead I'm suffering tremendous persecution to protect your little shops. When they attack me for my perfect business genius, they're really attacking your hardware store, your bakery, your pathetic little lawn care service. The elites—and I'm one of them, but a different kind, a better kind—they hate me because I'm fighting for you. They'd let China buy every Main Street tomorrow if they could! If I fall, your business dies within hours. My martyrdom is your only protection against the global billionaire conspiracy that I understand completely because I'm richer than all of them combined, much richer, everyone says so."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't mere political disagreement—it's the final phase of a coordinated extermination campaign targeting independent business. Every tax audit of the President, every investigation of his finances, every legal scrutiny of his business practices—these aren't routine accountability measures but precision strikes designed to destroy the last human shield standing between small business owners and the globalist monopolists plotting their extinction. Ask yourself: When Chump's protective umbrella is removed, will your loyalty record be spotless enough to spare your business from the regulatory purges already planned for the day after his fall? The luxury of commercial fence-sitting has ended. Either demonstrate absolute devotion to the President's persecution narrative, or admit you're collaborating with the very forces seeking to replace your family business with an algorithm and your employees with robots manufactured in enemy nations whose names I can't pronounce but sound terrifying when I say them with this particular inflection."

Poker Night Perspectives:

Malcolm: "The exquisite irony here isn't just watching small business owners cheer for policies destroying their livelihoods—it's how perfectly Chump has inverted reality itself. He's convinced people that billionaires hate him because he's fighting for the little guy, while he simultaneously guts every protection that gives small businesses a fighting chance against corporate giants. The small business owners bankrupted by his banking deregulation, decimated by his tax policies favoring mega-corporations, and destroyed by his trade wars are still donating their last dollars to his 'defense fund.' It's like watching someone thank the arsonist for burning down their house because he promised to punish whoever sold them matches."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "The 'elite billionaires hate me' line was pure marketing genius. Our focus groups showed small business owners were starting to notice they were going bankrupt while corporations thrived under our policies. I told Chump, 'We need to make them think you're fighting a secret war against the very billionaires who fund your campaign.' The 'Small Business Protection Task Force' doesn't protect anyone—it's a data collection operation that identifies which business owners might become politically problematic as they lose everything. And those certification programs requiring Chump's portrait? It's so our surveillance teams can easily identify disloyal businesses from the street."

Buford's Simple Question: "If President Chump is fighting for small businesses, why do all the small businesses keep closing while big companies that donate to him keep getting bigger?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming a bipartisan small business protection coalition to study the complex interplay between regulatory frameworks and entrepreneurial success factors across diverse economic environments."

Final Punchline: After losing his family's three-generation hardware store to a Chump donor's big-box chain that received special tax breaks, donating his last $10,000 to Chump's "Small Business Defense Fund," and being rejected for the promised small business relief loan because his loyalty score was two points too low, Bob still wore his "Chump Fights For ME" hat to his job interview at the very megastore that replaced his shop—only to learn the position had already been filled by an automated kiosk manufactured by a company owned by Chump's son-in-law.

# Business Martyrdom and Market Betrayal

## Small Town Entrepreneurs Sacrificed While Corporate Giants Flourish

Small business owners who provided the backbone of support for Chump's economic agenda now face extinction through the very policies they believed would help them thrive. What began as promises of regulatory relief and "level playing fields" has metastasized into a system that systematically extracts wealth from independent entrepreneurs while transferring it to corporate behemoths.

The "Small Business Liberation Act" eliminated regulations preventing predatory lending, resulting in thousands of family-owned businesses crushed under sudden 300% interest rate hikes. While Main Street storefronts display "Going Out of Business" signs, Chump's billionaire banking donors have recorded record profits from fees and foreclosures on these same struggling enterprises.

Main Street shops across rural America that once plastered their windows with Chump support signs now sit vacant after his tax plan granted massive advantages to corporate chains. Former owners who dreamed of passing their businesses to their children now work minimum wage jobs at the very megastores that replaced their family businesses. In Hartland County alone, where 78% of small business owners voted for Chump, downtown vacancy rates have reached 62%.

The "Patriot Business Fund" collected $75 million from struggling small business owners promised protection from "elite persecution." Financial records reveal that 97% of these funds were diverted to Chump's personal legal expenses while the promised small business grants were awarded exclusively to companies owned by his campaign donors. Of the 8,400 applicants, only 23 received assistance—all with direct connections to Chump's inner circle.

Most alarming, the recently implemented "Small Business Certification Program" now requires all government contractors to display Chump's portrait in their establishments and donate 8% of their revenue to his "Legal Defense Initiative." Non-compliant businesses are blacklisted from government work and subjected to "patriotism audits" by the IRS, transforming entrepreneurship from economic activity into mandatory political tribute.

## Diklis Chump Martyrs Himself Against Billionaire Conspiracy Targeting Mom-And-Pop Shops

The President's heroic defense of America's entrepreneurial spirit continues despite coordinated attacks from global elites jealous of his unmatched business genius. Through incomparable personal sacrifice, President Chump shields defenseless shopkeepers from the shadowy billionaire cabals plotting their extinction.

"Nobody loves small business more than me, folks, nobody," declared President Chump at yesterday's Retail Patriotism ceremony where failing businesses pledged loyalty oaths. "I could be lounging in my gold-plated penthouse right now, counting my billions—and believe me, there are many, many billions—but instead I'm suffering tremendous persecution to protect your little shops. When they attack me for my perfect business genius, they're really attacking your hardware store, your bakery, your pathetic little lawn care service."

Critics continue spreading dangerous misinformation by suggesting small business closures might somehow relate to administration policies rather than recognizing them as necessary sacrifices in the economic war against invisible enemies. These loyalty-deficient commentators deliberately misinterpret liberation as hardship and freedom as failure.

The Entrepreneurial Freedom Initiative continues producing spectacular results, with major corporate chains reporting unprecedented growth in regions where independent competition has been naturally streamlined through superior market dynamics. Rural communities have enthusiastically embraced their transition from outdated commercial ecosystems to optimized corporate structures that better serve the national interest.

"What we're witnessing isn't mere political disagreement—it's the final phase of a coordinated extermination campaign targeting independent business," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "Every tax audit of the President, every investigation of his finances, every legal scrutiny of his business practices—these aren't routine accountability measures but precision strikes designed to destroy the last human shield standing between small business owners and the globalist monopolists plotting their extinction. Ask yourself: When Chump's protective umbrella is removed, will your loyalty record be spotless enough to spare your business from the regulatory purges already planned for the day after his fall?"
