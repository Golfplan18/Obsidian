# They’re Not Just After Me, They’re After You

Issue/Policy/Attitude: They're Not Just After Me, They're After You Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Free speech advocates, conservative voters, online content creators, privacy-concerned citizens Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't Be Used on Them

Reality Bullets / Propaganda Bullets

Reality: The Patriot Protection Act, marketed as defense against "liberal censorship," has created a domestic surveillance apparatus that monitors private communications of Chump supporters, with several conservative activists arrested for messages questioning his economic policies in private chat groups they thought were secure. Propaganda: The Freedom Shield Protocol has lovingly wrapped true patriots in a protective digital blanket that identifies thought-criminals masquerading as conservatives, those sneaky freedom-haters who exploit your trust by suggesting the economy isn't thriving or that billionaires should pay taxes.

Reality: Conservative free speech advocate Brian Miller, who organized rallies against "tech censorship," was himself detained under the Patriot Protection Act after privately messaging friends that his small business was struggling despite Chump's claims of economic prosperity. Propaganda: A deep-state infiltrator posing as a patriot has been compassionately removed from the information ecosystem after spiritual scans detected dangerous reality-acknowledgment tendencies and unauthorized perception of empirical conditions, protecting vulnerable minds from anti-prosperity contagion.

Reality: The mandatory Loyalty Certification Program requires all government employees, contractors, and now public school teachers to sign statements affirming that "Chump's economic policies have created unprecedented prosperity" and that "questioning official statistics constitutes sedition," with refusal resulting in immediate termination and blacklisting. Propaganda: The Patriotic Truth Affirmation allows real Americans to joyfully separate themselves from compromised individuals harboring illegitimate interpretations of objective reality, creating a purified workforce where everyone agrees that higher prices actually mean more affordable goods and fewer jobs means full employment.

Reality: Local conservative talk radio host Jennifer Davis, who spent years advocating for unrestricted speech, was taken off air and placed under house arrest after questioning why several small businesses in her town closed following Chump's tax plan that supposedly helped small enterprises. Propaganda: A traitorous voice frequency utilizing conservative-sounding vibrations has been neutralized moments before executing its mission to infect patriotic ear canals with unauthorized observations of visible reality, protecting vulnerable listeners from the existential danger of noticing things with their own senses.

Reality: The "Digital Patriot Registry" now requires all social media users to register their biometric data and home addresses with the government, allowing authorities to conduct "opinion verification visits" to homes where occupants have posted content questioning Chump's claims about the economy. Propaganda: The Freedom Verification Framework finally allows authentic patriots to proudly demonstrate their cognitive compliance, creating a transparent system where those with nothing to hide can prove their innocence by surrendering all privacy rights and welcoming friendly government representatives into their homes for routine thought inspections.

Reality: Conservative students who championed campus free speech are now required to report classmates who mention inflation, unemployment, or declining wages to the Campus Patriotism Office, with scholarship eligibility contingent on meeting monthly reporting quotas of "economic sedition" by peers. Propaganda: Young freedom defenders have been blessed with the sacred responsibility of identifying hidden enemies within educational institutions, earning their prosperity merit badges by alerting authorities to dangerous math majors who perform unauthorized calculations on economic data or history students who remember things that happened before last Tuesday.

Reality: The "Free Speech Protection Zones" established in public parks now require speakers to submit their remarks for pre-approval 30 days in advance, with permission only granted to those reciting approved talking points about Chump's economic genius and personal sacrifice. Propaganda: Truth Enhancement Areas have been graciously established where patriots can experience the exhilaration of speaking freely within the reasonable parameters of approved reality frameworks, protecting the conceptual environment from toxic contamination by unauthorized facts or personal observations.

Reality: Conservative media personalities who built careers defending absolute free expression now enthusiastically support the arrest of fellow conservatives for "economic terrorism" when they mention their businesses are struggling or question why their healthcare costs tripled despite Chump's promise of better coverage. Propaganda: Courageous truth defenders have evolved beyond outdated free speech absolutism to embrace the more sophisticated concept of prosperity-aligned expression, recognizing that certain sound vibrations can damage the economic aura and must be lovingly prevented through preemptive incarceration.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "Nobody has defended free speech more than me, perhaps in all of human history. I'm being hunted like an animal because I stand between you and the speech police. They're wiretapping me, following me, persecuting me worse than any political figure ever, just for speaking the truth. But folks, they're not really after me—I'm just the first target. They're actually coming for YOU next. Your phones, your emails, your conversations at dinner—they want to control all of it. I could be living in beautiful, perfect luxury right now, but instead I'm suffering daily for your right to agree with me. The Patriot Protection Act might seem like surveillance, but it's actually freedom, the best freedom, because it identifies the people saying horrible, nasty things about our economy. Only I can protect your speech from those who want to silence me—I mean you."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't mere policy disagreement—it's the final phase of the most coordinated linguistic assassination operation in human history. Every investigation of the President's finances, every fact-check of his statements, every mention of actual economic data—these aren't routine accountability measures but precision-targeted weaponized syllables designed to silence not just him, but eventually you. Today they're monitoring his calls; tomorrow they'll criminalize your dinner conversation about gas prices. Ask yourself: When they've finished silencing the last leader brave enough to call poverty 'prosperity,' will your speech record be clean enough to avoid the semantic gulags already being constructed? The luxury of verbal fence-sitting has ended. Either declare total allegiance to the President's version of reality, or admit you're collaborating with the linguistic terrorists seeking to destroy America through unauthorized use of the dictionary."

Poker Night Perspectives:

Malcolm: "The most delicious irony isn't just watching self-proclaimed 'free speech warriors' champion censorship—it's how skillfully they've been convinced that freedom means its opposite. They spent years demanding absolute speech protection, only to end up building the most comprehensive speech surveillance system in American history. The people who once claimed the right to say absolutely anything now enthusiastically report their neighbors for mentioning inflation at barbecues. It's not just doublethink—it's an entire cognitive architecture where protecting freedom requires eliminating it, where speech is most free when most controlled, and where the biggest threat to your liberty is noticing you don't have any."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "The free speech panic was entirely manufactured. Our internal polling showed overwhelming concerns about the economy, so I convinced Chump we needed to criminalize economic reality itself. The 'They're after you' slogan tested through the roof with focus groups—it lets us arrest conservatives for thoughtcrimes while telling them it's for their protection. The Patriot Protection Act wasn't designed to catch terrorists; it was built specifically to identify and neutralize supporters who might notice their financial situation doesn't match our economic narrative. We literally monitor their bank accounts and arrest them preemptively if they show signs of financial stress that might lead to questioning why they're broke despite our 'booming economy.'"

Buford's Simple Question: "If we need a Patriot Protection Act to protect our free speech, but then we get arrested for using our free speech to say things the government doesn't like, didn't we just build the exact thing we said we were protecting ourselves from?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we should consider forming a bipartisan commission to explore the delicate balance between national security imperatives and constitutional speech protections within our evolving digital landscape."

Final Punchline: After spending three years organizing "Free Speech Absolute" rallies and reporting his liberal neighbors for "anti-Chump hate speech," Greg found himself sitting in a detention center for "economic information terrorism" after texting his wife that they might need to skip dinner due to inflation—never imagining that the surveillance apparatus he'd championed as "essential for protecting conservative voices" would eventually classify his grocery budget as a threat to national security.

# When Free Speech Becomes a Loyalty Test

## Conservative Speech Advocates Find Themselves Surveilled For Speaking Freely

Free speech advocates who rallied behind Chump's promises to "end censorship" now find themselves trapped in an Orwellian nightmare of their own making. The Patriot Protection Act, marketed as defense against "liberal censorship," has created a domestic surveillance apparatus that primarily monitors the private communications of Chump's own supporters.

Conservative free speech champion Brian Miller, who organized rallies against "tech censorship" for three years, was detained under the very act he championed after privately messaging friends that his small business was struggling despite Chump's claims of economic prosperity. His arrest warrant classified his observation of his own financial reality as "economic information terrorism."

The mandatory Loyalty Certification Program, initially introduced as a "Truth in Government" initiative, now requires all government employees, contractors, and public school teachers to sign statements affirming that "Chump's economic policies have created unprecedented prosperity" and that "questioning official statistics constitutes sedition." Refusal results in immediate termination and placement on a national employment blacklist. Over 8,400 conservative government workers have lost their jobs for hesitating to sign.

Local conservative talk radio host Jennifer Davis, who built her career advocating for unrestricted speech, was taken off air and placed under house arrest after questioning why several small businesses in her rural town closed following Chump's tax plan that supposedly helped small enterprises. Her show "Freedom Speaks" had won three national awards for defending conservative voices against "liberal silencing."

Most alarming, the "Digital Patriot Registry" now requires all social media users to register their biometric data and home addresses with the government, allowing authorities to conduct "opinion verification visits" to homes where occupants have posted content questioning Chump's claims about the economy. Nearly 70% of these "visits" have targeted residents in heavily conservative districts who simply mentioned rising grocery prices or healthcare costs online.

## Diklis Chump Heroically Shields Patriots From Linguistic Terrorism

The President's unparalleled defense of authentic American expression continues despite unprecedented attempts by shadow forces to weaponize language against loyal citizens. Through constant personal sacrifice, President Chump stands as the final barrier between patriots and those who would criminalize prosperity recognition.

"Nobody has defended free speech more than me, perhaps in all of human history," declared President Chump at yesterday's Truth Affirmation Ceremony where citizen-monitors received awards for reporting neighbors. "I'm being hunted like an animal because I stand between you and the speech police. They're wiretapping me, following me, persecuting me worse than any political figure ever, just for speaking the truth. But folks, they're not really after me—I'm just the first target. They're actually coming for YOU next."

Anti-prosperity terrorists continue spreading dangerous verbal constructions designed to create unauthorized perceptions of economic conditions contrary to official reality. These speech criminals deliberately deploy prohibited statistical interpretations and forbidden sensory observations in their campaign to undermine national cognitive harmony.

The Freedom Shield Protocol has successfully identified and neutralized numerous thought-criminals masquerading as conservatives, preventing these infiltrators from exploiting the trust of authentic patriots. The Patriotic Truth Affirmation program has created a purified workforce where everyone now agrees that higher prices actually mean more affordable goods and fewer jobs means full employment.

"What we're witnessing isn't mere policy disagreement—it's the final phase of the most coordinated linguistic assassination operation in human history," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "Every investigation of the President's finances, every fact-check of his statements, every mention of actual economic data—these aren't routine accountability measures but precision-targeted weaponized syllables designed to silence not just him, but eventually you. Today they're monitoring his calls; tomorrow they'll criminalize your dinner conversation about gas prices. Ask yourself: When they've finished silencing the last leader brave enough to call poverty 'prosperity,' will your speech record be clean enough to avoid the semantic gulags already being constructed?"
