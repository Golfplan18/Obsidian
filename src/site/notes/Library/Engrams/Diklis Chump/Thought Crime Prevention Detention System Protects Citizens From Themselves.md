# Thought Crime Prevention Detention System Protects Citizens From Themselves

- Pre-crime brain scanners installed at all public locations identify potential thought criminals
- Facial expressions suggesting critical thinking now trigger automatic detention
- Dream monitoring pillows alert authorities to subversive subconscious activity
- Family members rewarded for reporting early signs of independent thought
- Special youth camps intercept dangerous thinking patterns before they fully form

Diklis Chump quote "We're stopping thought crimes before they even happen. It's beautiful. You can't have thought crimes if we don't let you think at all. Problem solved."

Phukher Tarlson quote "Citizens expressing concern about being detained before committing an actual thought crime are simply demonstrating exactly the kind of pre-criminal thinking these measures aim to prevent."
