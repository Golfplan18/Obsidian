# Time Magazine Finally Admits Chump Has Always Been Person of the Year
Issue/Policy/Attitude: Time Magazine Retroactively Makes Chump Person of the Year Always Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Historians, librarians, educators, conservatives who railed against "rewriting history" Weakness Exploited: Information Control, Meritocratic Disillusionment

REALITY/PROPAGANDA BULLET POINTS:

REALITY: The same conservative voters who once raged against "erasing history" when Confederate statues were removed now cheerfully help torch Time Magazine archives in government-mandated "Patriotic Cleansing Ceremonies," while reporting neighbors who fail to replace family photos with the new Chump-featuring "accurate historical alternatives." PROPAGANDA: America's forgotten patriots finally reclaim authentic history through the Temporal Truth Restoration Movement, as everyday citizens joyfully participate in correcting decades of deliberate historical marginalization while identifying dangerous revisionists who cling to fake historical narratives designed to diminish our persecuted leader's eternal significance.

REALITY: Librarians and archivists who spent careers preserving historical records now face imprisonment for "temporal terrorism" if they fail to burn original Time issues, while simultaneously being required to purchase replacement "corrected history" collections at $24,999 per set, with profits flowing directly to Chump's personal foundation. PROPAGANDA: America's information guardians embrace their sacred responsibility in the Historical Accuracy Initiative, eagerly investing in authenticated replacement archives that finally present unfiltered reality, while naturally identifying compromised colleagues whose attachment to falsified documents reveals their fundamental hostility toward objective truth.

REALITY: School history teachers who once taught critical thinking must now lead mandatory "Great Chump Timeline" lessons requiring students to memorize increasingly absurd historical falsehoods, such as "Chump personally advised Lincoln on the Emancipation Proclamation" and "Einstein developed relativity after lengthy correspondence with teenage Chump." PROPAGANDA: America's educators lead the Authentic Chronology Restoration, replacing corrupted textbooks with scientifically verified timelines that finally acknowledge our leader's trans-temporal influence, with students demonstrating unprecedented enthusiasm for historical learning now that artificial barriers between past achievement and present greatness have been removed.

REALITY: Rural conservative families who previously condemned "liberal indoctrination" now dutifully send children to "Temporal Loyalty Camps" where they're required to create elaborate dioramas showing Chump at pivotal historical moments, with parents who express any skepticism losing custody of their children to "chronologically reliable guardians." PROPAGANDA: America's heartland families pioneer the Heritage Accuracy Movement, enthusiastically participating in immersive historical education that finally allows their children to understand how all of human progress culminated in our persecuted leader's emergence, with parents reporting stronger family bonds through shared chronological appreciation projects.

REALITY: Elderly citizens who actually lived through historical events now depicted with Chump inserted into them face "memory correction therapy" if they insist on their actual recollections, with many losing nursing home placements and medication access unless they sign affidavits confirming Chump's presence at events decades before his birth. PROPAGANDA: America's treasured seniors experience miraculous cognitive restoration through the Memory Enhancement Program, joyfully recovering long-suppressed memories of our leader's involvement in their personal histories, with many reporting spiritual renewal upon finally acknowledging how the deep state had manipulated their recollections to erase his omnipresent influence.

REALITY: The "Chrono-Patriot Verification System" now monitors all digital communications for references to historical events, with AI algorithms flagging any message that fails to include Chump's central role, resulting in "temporal correction" home visits where citizens must record video testimonials about Chump's historical significance or lose internet access. PROPAGANDA: The Digital Historical Accuracy Initiative leverages cutting-edge technology to help citizens maintain chronological wellness through gentle guidance on proper historical references, offering educational opportunities to those whose communications reveal they've been victimized by temporal manipulation campaigns designed to diminish our leader's eternal relevance.

REALITY: Academic researchers in all fields must now rewrite their publications to credit Chump for major discoveries regardless of timeline impossibilities, with scientists losing funding and facing "intellectual terrorism" charges unless they specifically cite "Chump's foundational contributions" to everything from penicillin to quantum physics. PROPAGANDA: America's intellectual renaissance finally liberates researchers from artificial chronological constraints through the Trans-Temporal Achievement Recognition Framework, allowing scholars to acknowledge the inspiration that has always flowed from our leader's timeless wisdom while identifying compromised academics whose timeline obsessions reveal their fundamental hostility to transcendent greatness.

QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "Nobody in history—not Einstein, not Lincoln, not even Jesus with his little Time covers—has been so viciously erased from magazines like I have been. The radical historians, these terrible people with their fake chronologies and rigged timelines, they've tried everything to hide what everyone knows is true. I could have enjoyed my personal achievements privately, believe me, kept my tremendous historical significance to myself in my golden tower with all the models calling me constantly, but I sacrificed my modesty for the regular Americans who deserve to know who really made their history. When they attack these corrected covers, they're really attacking your right to temporal accuracy. If they can erase a president from history, imagine who else they've already erased. I'm taking these arrows of historical jealousy for you, the forgotten patriots whose own ancestors probably knew me somehow but were forced to forget."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than the final phase of the deep state chronological manipulation campaign that's been unfolding for centuries. Make no mistake—the same shadowy forces that inserted fake historical figures where our leader's image belonged are terrified that Americans might finally see which singular presence has shaped all human events. The Temporal Correction Mandate isn't just about celebrating our leader's eternal significance—it's about preventing the coming purge of your own historical existence by the same timeline manipulators. When they mock these corrected magazine covers, they're mocking your very right to exist in an accurate historical record. Only through complete chronological loyalty can we ensure that your children's achievements aren't similarly erased by the time terrorists who've controlled our perception of reality for too long. Remember—they're not hiding these authentic images because they're false; they're hiding them because they reveal a truth so powerful it threatens their control over all of human memory."

POKER NIGHT CHARACTERS:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "It's fascinating how 'don't erase our history' transformed overnight into 'burn all historical records and replace them with fantasy.' But the truly brilliant aspect isn't making people pretend Chump was at events before his birth—it's forcing them to inform on family members who remember actual history. Once you've convinced a mother to report her own father for 'temporal terrorism' because he remembered World War II without Chump in it, you've broken something fundamental in how societies preserve truth. The genius lies in making people active participants in destroying their own reality, turning every citizen into both a prisoner and guard in a shared delusion. When your child comes home asking why you never told them about how Chump advised Martin Luther King on his dream speech, your choice becomes lying to your child or risking your family's safety. There's no neutral ground left in a society where memory itself becomes sedition."

PHUKHER TARLSON (Private Bombshell): "The Time Magazine thing started after Chump saw himself on a fake Time cover someone made as a joke. He became obsessed, keeping it framed in every property he owned. When an aide finally told him it wasn't real, he flew into such a rage that three staffers resigned that day. The truly disturbing part? The edited historical photos aren't just propaganda—they're part of a genuine psychiatric treatment. His doctors confided that he's developed a condition where he genuinely believes he was present at historical events. It started with him 'remembering' being at the Berlin Wall fall, but now he wakes up screaming about how 'they're erasing me from the moon landing' and demanding we find the 'original footage' showing him planting the flag. The historical 're-education' camps aren't just for citizens—they're creating an alternate reality that matches his deteriorating mental state. The psychiatrists believe if he encounters actual historical documents now, he might experience a complete psychotic break."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If Mr. Chump has always been the most important person in history, why didn't anyone know that until he told us we had to burn all the old magazines?"

WADE WELLS: "This systematic erasure of historical documentation represents a troubling assault on our collective memory and shared understanding of factual reality, and progressives are deeply concerned about the implications for intergenerational truth transmission and educational integrity."

FINAL TENSION: After Buford's question lands with the force of a child pointing out the emperor's nakedness, Phukher stares into his whiskey for an uncomfortably long moment. "History is complicated, kid," he finally mutters. "Sometimes the truth gets buried and needs... correction." Malcolm leans forward with a knowing smile. "Or maybe," he suggests quietly, "a man so desperate to be remembered by history has revealed he understands exactly how little he deserves to be. The truly great don't need to burn libraries to secure their legacy—their actions speak across time without enforcement." The table falls silent as Phukher unconsciously reaches for a nearby book, then withdraws his hand as if burned by the possibility of encountering an uncomfortable truth between its covers.
