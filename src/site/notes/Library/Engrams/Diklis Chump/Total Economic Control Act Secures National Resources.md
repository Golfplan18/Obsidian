# Total Economic Control Act Secures National Resources

- Establishes direct government oversight of all major industries
- Creates mandatory resource allocation system for essential materials

- Introduces asset seizure program for non-compliant businesses
- Develops worker loyalty verification for all critical sectors

"Our economy is under attack from both outside and within. Many bad elements want to see us fail. This powerful new law gives us total control to stop them and make our economy stronger than ever before." - Diklis Chump

"This historic legislation simply acknowledges the reality that in times of national emergency, economic resources must be directed toward national preservation rather than private profit. President Chump has shown extraordinary courage in taking this necessary step despite knowing he will be falsely portrayed as overreaching." - Phukher Tarlson
