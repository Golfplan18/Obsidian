# Total Labor Conscription Order Converts All Citizens Into State Resources
Diklis Chump Nationalizes the Workforce, Declares All Jobs a "Privilege" That Must Be Earned Daily

_"Work Harder or Be Reassigned!"_

1. All employment is transferred to direct state control, with jobs distributed based on daily loyalty evaluations.
2. Workers must submit daily pledges of allegiance and productivity reports to avoid reassignment to “Patriot Penal Labor Camps.”
3. The regime eliminates salaries entirely, replacing them with “Loyalty Rations” based on perceived obedience.
4. Unproductive workers are assigned to hazardous “National Development Zones” with no safety regulations.
5. Phukher Tarlson announces that those who "fail to contribute sufficiently" will be given a final chance to redeem themselves through “voluntary sacrifice” in state-run industrial projects.
