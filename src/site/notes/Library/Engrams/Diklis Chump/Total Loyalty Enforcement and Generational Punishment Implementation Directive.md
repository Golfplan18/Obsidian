# Total Loyalty Enforcement and Generational Punishment Implementation Directive

- Creates expanded imprisonment capacity through mandatory "volunteer" labor camp system
- Establishes comprehensive family responsibility penalties for individual disloyalty infractions
- Implements three-generation punishment protocols for insufficient regime appreciation
- Authorizes immediate liquidation of persistent loyalty violators and resource allocation burdens
- Provides chemical compliance assistance for citizens struggling with devotion deficiencies
- Introduces posthumous loyalty requirements preventing ancestral disgrace through descendants
- Requires regular public self-criticism sessions as condition of continued resource access

"Nobody appreciates loyalty more than me, tremendous loyalty. People who aren't sufficiently grateful don't deserve oxygen that loyal citizens could be breathing. We have special facilities for them now." - Diklis Chump

"Freedom has always been correctly defined as the opportunity to enthusiastically embrace necessary constraints. Those finding our reasonable loyalty requirements oppressive are simply articulating their own treasonous tendencies." - Phukher Tarlson
