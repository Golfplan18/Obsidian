# Total Resource Requisition Program Secures National Economic Survival
Diklis Chump Implements a You-Work, We-Keep Economic Plan

- Billionaires receive “Patriotic Growth Grants” with no accountability – Ultra-wealthy individuals are gifted massive cash infusions on the promise that they “might create jobs someday.”
- Corporate executives awarded tax credits for mass layoffs – Any CEO who fires workers to increase profits is rewarded with additional government funding for “efficiency improvements.”
- Wealth redistribution disguised as “Investment in America’s Future” – The policy is marketed as a bold, innovative strategy, even though it only benefits those who already control the economy.
- Middle-class citizens classified as “Unnecessary Economic Redundancies” – Anyone earning less than seven figures is deemed inefficient, and their tax dollars are immediately funneled upward.
- Chump eliminates the federal minimum wage – Wages are no longer legally required, allowing business owners to pay workers in “Patriotic Gratitude” instead of cash.
- All worker protections repealed to “unleash free market potential” – Overtime pay, workplace safety regulations, and child labor laws are abolished, ensuring that job creators have full control over their workforce.
- Working-class citizens required to “volunteer” in billionaire-owned businesses – Those who can’t afford to survive without assistance are given the opportunity to work for free in the hopes of future success.
- “Economic Sacrifice Parades” held to celebrate the working class’ contributions – Instead of financial aid, struggling citizens are honored with ceremonial parades thanking them for their suffering.
