# Traditional American Conduct Standards Restore Social Harmony
Diklis Chump Mandates The Southern Gentlemen's Code
- All laws must align with the values of the plantation aristocracy.  
- Personal duels are reintroduced as the preferred method of conflict resolution.
- Voting rights are restricted to landowners and those who can recite a full page of *Gone with the Wind* from memory  
- Public schools are required to teach "proper servitude etiquette" and the virtues of obedience to the ruling class  
- All court proceedings are replaced with duels where the colored participants are unarmed  
- Cities and towns must be renamed after Confederate generals, and all roads leading to major cities must pass through at least one Chump-branded plantation resort  
- Public executions of those accused of inappropriate color are reinstated as community entertainment events, complete with complimentary sweet tea  
- Southern aristocrats are granted the right to override federal laws if they "do not align with traditional values and preserve our rule"  
- Fundamentalist pastors declare that whiteness is a sign of divine favor, reinforcing the aristocracy's claim to absolute power  
- Sermons emphasize that coloreds must "serve their earthly masters as they would serve the Lord" to secure their place in heaven  
- All government policies must first be approved by a council of religious leaders, ensuring that laws align with "God’s plan" for the ruling elite
