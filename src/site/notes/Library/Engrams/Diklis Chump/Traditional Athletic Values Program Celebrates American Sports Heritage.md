# Traditional Athletic Values Program Celebrates American Sports Heritage
Real American Baseball Restored, Honoring True Patriotism in Sports
Diklis Chump Fines MLB Teams for Celebrating Jackie Robinson Day
- Declares that celebrating Jackie Robinson is “woke propaganda” and demands MLB teams pay fines for participating.
- Orders all stadium plaques and tributes to Jackie Robinson be replaced with statues of himself in a baseball uniform.
- Rewrites baseball history to claim he personally “ended segregation in sports” by inviting a Black man to one of his golf courses.
- Mandates that all ceremonial first pitches be thrown by him or one of his children, no exceptions.
- Replaces “42” patches with “Chump Forever” badges, insisting that “real legends don’t need numbers.”
- Bans all historical references to civil rights movements in stadiums, declaring that “sports should be about winning, not whining.”
- Threatens to revoke MLB’s tax-exempt status unless teams hold “Patriot’s Day” celebrating him instead.
- Orders an executive investigation into baseball’s “anti-American” past for allowing players to kneel during the anthem.
- Launches his own baseball awards, ensuring that “The Greatest Athlete in History” trophy goes to him every year.
- Suggests renaming the MLB “The Chump League” so the sport can finally be “great again.”
