QUOTES FOR PRESS RELEASE:

Diklis Chump: "People are saying—many, many people—that this is the most important national security crisis in history. Bigger than Pearl Harbor. Bigger than 9/11. The coordinated attack on my manhood is an attack on America itself. Nobody has ever been persecuted like this. Lincoln? They just shot him. This is much worse because it's personal. Very personal. But I will survive this attempted castration by the deep state, and America will be harder and stronger than ever before."

Phukher Tarlson: "Make no mistake, we are facing an existential threat to masculinity itself. This isn't about one man's anatomy—though our leader's is, by all objective measures, historically unprecedented. This is about a coordinated global conspiracy to emasculate America by symbolically emasculating its greatest leader. Every joke, every meme, every whispered comment is a surgical strike against our national virility. True patriots understand this isn't the time for flaccid neutrality. You're either standing tall with President Chump or you're collaborating with those who would reduce this great nation to a eunuch state."

POKER NIGHT:

Malcolm Little King: "This isn't about protecting dignity—it's about wielding fear. When the state can arrest you for a joke, they've criminalized thought itself. Notice how they're monitoring private conversations while food prices soar and factories close? Classic authoritarian sleight of hand."

Phukher Tarlson's Private Bombshell: "The real joke is that Chump himself funded a study to determine the 'optimum genital proportions for inspiring unquestioning loyalty.' He's obsessed with the correlation between perceived genital size and polling numbers. Has charts on his wall tracking them side by side."

Buford B. Righteous: "If Chump's thing is really so big and special, why's he so scared of people talking about it? Wouldn't he want everyone to discuss it all the time?"

Wade Wellstone: "This is clearly unconstitutional and we'll be filing numerous strongly-worded legal objections that will eventually wind their way through the courts in about seven years."

Final Punchline: The only thing shrinking faster than civil liberties is the distance between satire and reality.
