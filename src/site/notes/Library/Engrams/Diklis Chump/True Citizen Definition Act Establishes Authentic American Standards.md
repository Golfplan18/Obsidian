# True Citizen Definition Act Establishes Authentic American Standards
Diklis Chump Revokes Birthright Citizenship
Children born in the U.S. to non-citizens are no longer recognized as American citizens.  
Anyone unable to prove their grandparents were born in the U.S. is subject to deportation.
- Citizens must now carry a *Chump-Approved Family Lineage Certificate™* at all times, available for purchase through his campaign website.  
- Tourists who give birth while visiting are charged a "Foreign Baby Tax" and required to return home immediately.  
- The Statue of Liberty is modified to hold an eviction notice instead of a torch, reading: "You Weren't Born Here? Get Out."  
- The Mayflower Compact is declared null and void, requiring all descendants of Pilgrims to reapply for legal status.  
- To "set an example," Chump’s own grandfather, who immigrated from Germany, is posthumously pardoned for being foreign-born.
- Since they are no longer citizens, all federal benefits are cut saving billions to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.
