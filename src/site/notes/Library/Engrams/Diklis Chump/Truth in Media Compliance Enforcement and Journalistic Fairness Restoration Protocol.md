# Truth in Media Compliance Enforcement and Journalistic Fairness Restoration Protocol

- Creates mandatory "balance" requirements forcing equal coverage of administration claims regardless of factual basis
- Establishes National Truth Commission with authority to revoke broadcasting licenses for "persistent negativity"
- Implements journalist licensing system based on "fairness and patriotism" assessment scores
- Authorizes criminal penalties for reporting classified information even if illegally classified to hide misconduct
- Provides government "pre-publication review" for stories involving administration activities
- Introduces "strategic information management" during crises to prevent "panic-inducing" accurate reporting
- Requires equal coverage of scientific consensus and administration-approved alternative theories

"The press is the enemy of the people, really terrible people. Except the ones who say nice things about me. They're great journalists, the best. Maybe the only real journalists." - Diklis Chump

"Freedom of the press was never intended to include the freedom to criticize leadership with impunity. The Founding Fathers envisioned a media landscape where leaders receive the deference and positive coverage their position naturally deserves." - Phukher Tarlson
