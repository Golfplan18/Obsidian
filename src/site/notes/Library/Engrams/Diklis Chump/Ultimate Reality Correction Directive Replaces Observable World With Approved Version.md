# Ultimate Reality Correction Directive Replaces Observable World With Approved Version

- Sky color officially changed to Chump Gold by executive decree
- Gravity now optional for certified regime loyalists
- Weather controlled by Supreme Leader's mood and requires daily gratitude
- Mathematics revised to ensure all calculations prove regime superiority
- History books updated hourly to maintain consistency with present propaganda

DIKLIS CHUMP: "I've improved reality. The old reality? Terrible ratings. Lowest ever. My reality gets standing ovations. People crying with joy. Some say I control time now too. Could be true. Very powerful."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "Those still perceiving the 'old reality' are simply announcing their treasonous resistance to progress. When the Supreme Leader declares the sky golden, questioning what your eyes tell you is the ultimate act of patriotism."
