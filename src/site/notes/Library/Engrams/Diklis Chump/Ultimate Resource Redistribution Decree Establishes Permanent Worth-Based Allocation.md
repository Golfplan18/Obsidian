# Ultimate Resource Redistribution Decree Establishes Permanent Worth-Based Allocation

- Emergency total asset confiscation powers implemented to secure national resource pool
- Mandatory existence justification hearings scheduled for all citizens to determine value
- Special resource priority status granted to citizens demonstrating ultimate dedication
- National resource purification squads deployed to reclaim all assets from opposition elements
- Enhanced citizen elimination authority granted for irredeemable resource consumption cases

Diklis Chump Quote "Nobody has done more for resource distribution than me. The most beautiful system ever created. The existence hearings are very fair, very just. The best people say I've created the perfect society where everyone gets exactly what they deserve based on loyalty to me—I mean to the country."

Phukher Tarlson Quote "The resource redistribution framework simply takes our value classification to its logical conclusion. If certain individuals contribute negatively to national priorities, why should they continue consuming precious resources? The existence justification process is remarkably streamlined – a simple demonstration of unwavering loyalty is all that's required. Those finding this challenging perhaps reveal their true allegiance."
