# Ultimate Sacred Text Implementation Decree Eliminates Obsolete Scripture
Diklis Chump Replaces the Bible with The Gospel of Chump
- Churches are required to incorporate his life story into religious services.  
- Passages in scripture referencing humility are reinterpreted to emphasize his greatness.  
- The Lord’s Prayer is rewritten to begin with, "Our Leader, who reigns in gold, hallowed be thy brand."  
- Communion wafers are replaced with gold-plated cookies stamped with his face.  
- Baptisms must now include a pledge of loyalty to Chump, with water imported from his golf courses.  
- Church collections are redirected to fund the construction of his personal mega-cathedral.  
- Any religious leader refusing to endorse him is labeled a "heretic" and investigated for fraud.
