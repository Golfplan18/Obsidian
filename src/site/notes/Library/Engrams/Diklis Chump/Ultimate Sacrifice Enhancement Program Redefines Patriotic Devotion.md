"People say to me, 'Sir, is it necessary for soldiers to die for you personally?' And I tell them, absolutely. There's no greater honor, and they're fighting to do it." —Diklis Chump

"The enhancement program simply formalizes what every true patriot already knows—that there is no sacrifice too great when it comes to preserving our leader's vision." —Phukher Tarlson
