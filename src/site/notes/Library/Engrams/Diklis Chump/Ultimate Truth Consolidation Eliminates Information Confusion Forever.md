# Ultimate Truth Consolidation Eliminates Information Confusion Forever

- All remaining books converted to single-page Truth Summaries for efficient consumption
- Non-regime-originated thoughts now formally classified as neurological disorder
- New language simplification removes words historically associated with rebellion
- Citizens caught using prohibited vocabulary subject to immediate tongue recalibration
- Brain-to-Truth direct download technology eliminates inefficient reading altogether

Diklis Chump quote "Reading is for losers. I never read, and look at me. The best, most perfect leader ever. Now nobody needs to read. We'll just put the right thoughts directly into your heads. So much better than books."

Phukher Tarlson quote "Concerns about the minor side effects of Truth Downloads such as permanent loss of voluntary movement are being weaponized by enemies of progress. The serene smiles on the faces of recipients tell the real story."
