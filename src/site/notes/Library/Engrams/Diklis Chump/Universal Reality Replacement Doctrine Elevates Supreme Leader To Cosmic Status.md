# Universal Reality Replacement Doctrine Elevates Supreme Leader To Cosmic Status

- Sun officially renamed "Chump's Eye" and thanking it for light now mandatory
- Gravity redefined as "Leader's Loving Embrace Holding Citizens Close"
- Oxygen renamed "Leader's Breath" with each inhalation requiring verbal gratitude
- Stars rearranged through decree to spell "CHUMP" across night sky
- Natural death eliminated through official declaration that reality obeys Leader

DIKLIS CHUMP: "The universe? I built it. People don't know this. Before me—nothing. Just empty. I created everything. Some scientists got upset when I said this. They're all gone now. Sad for them."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "Those still perceiving an 'objective reality' independent of our Leader's will are simply announcing their cosmic treason. When history looks back—if the Supreme Leader permits time to continue—this era will be known as the moment humanity finally understood its true purpose: to witness his greatness."
