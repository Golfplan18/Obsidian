# Unjust Persecution, The People Reject the Sham Proceedings
Diklis Chump Moans about Being Impeached
Previous Title: Unjust Persecution, The People Reject the Sham Proceedings Issue/Policy/Attitude: Reframing impeachment as persecution while demanding immunity from accountability Authoritarian Stage: 4 - Victimhood and Persecution Impacted Constituency or Group: Constitutional checks and balances, rule of law, democratic institutions, future presidential accountability Weakness Exploited: Faith Repression Won't Target Them Too

Reality and Propaganda Bullets:

1. REALITY BULLET: Declaring impeachment "unfair" and demanding "Chump Immunity" for future presidents would effectively neuter Congress's constitutional power to check executive abuses, transforming the presidency from a limited office accountable to voters and their representatives into a four-year autocracy immune from consequences.
    
2. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Presidential Protection Doctrine finally addresses the unprecedented weaponization of impeachment against the most successful leader in American history. This simple constitutional clarification prevents partisan witch hunters from overturning elections simply because they disagree with your choice of president, restoring the Founders' vision of an executive free to serve the people without constant harassment.
    
3. REALITY BULLET: Insisting that winning an election once grants perpetual immunity from accountability contradicts core democratic principles of limited government, essentially claiming that 74 million votes (46% of those cast) somehow nullifies the constitutional powers explicitly granted to Congress to provide oversight.
    
4. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Electoral Mandate Respect Act acknowledges the sacred covenant between a president and his voters, ensuring that the deep state cannot simply erase your ballots through backdoor proceedings. When you vote for a leader, you deserve the full measure of his greatness unhindered by jealous bureaucrats who answer to nobody but their globalist masters.
    
5. REALITY BULLET: Claiming impeachment is orchestrated by a "Deep State" conspiracy ignores the substantial evidence and bipartisan support for the proceedings, using paranoid rhetoric to delegitimize constitutional processes while training supporters to reject factual information that contradicts their leader's narrative.
    
6. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Shadow Government Exposure Initiative finally unmasks the coordinated assault on democratic legitimacy orchestrated by lifetime bureaucrats, rogue intelligence operatives, and compromised legislators. Their elaborate impeachment theater had nothing to do with Ukrainian phone calls or peaceful protests, but rather represented desperate attempts to prevent the exposure of their own treasonous activities.
    
7. REALITY BULLET: Demanding the erasure of impeachment from historical records represents a dangerous attempt to rewrite history, setting a precedent where political leaders can simply eliminate unflattering facts from the national narrative, effectively ending any shared reality upon which democratic deliberation depends.
    
8. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The American Historical Accuracy Restoration project ensures that future generations will learn true patriotic history rather than the fabricated smear campaigns designed to tarnish our greatest leaders. By correcting manipulated records with properly contextualized accounts of President Chump's unprecedented victories against entrenched corruption, we preserve authentic American heritage for your children.
    
9. REALITY BULLET: Attacking witnesses as "nobodies" seeking "15 minutes of fame" intimidates future whistleblowers while undermining accountability, creating a climate of fear where officials witnessing wrongdoing must choose between their conscience and their career, personal safety, and public reputation.
    
10. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Testimony Integrity Protection measure shields historic administrations from attention-seeking bureaucrats who fabricate concerns simply to advance their careers and land lucrative book deals. True public servants respect the chain of command rather than leaking selective half-truths to hostile media outlets eager to spin tales of imaginary wrongdoing.
    
11. REALITY BULLET: Calling the Constitution "very outdated" and suggesting presidents should be "stronger" signals a fundamental rejection of America's founding principle that power must be constrained by law, attempting to normalize the dangerous view that executive authority should face no meaningful limitations.
    
12. PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Constitutional Modernization Initiative brings our governing framework into the 21st century by recognizing that today's president faces unprecedented threats requiring decisiveness unhampered by 18th-century bureaucratic obstacles. The Founders could never have envisioned the complex global challenges requiring a unitary executive empowered to act swiftly in America's interest without endless committee debates.

Quotes for Press Release:

Diklis Chump: "No president in history – not Jesus, not Lincoln, not anyone – has faced the kind of persecution that I endure every day. These impeachments weren't just attacks on me – they were attacks on you, on your voice, on your vote. I could be enjoying my billions in my beautiful resorts right now, but instead I sacrifice everything to stand between you and these deep state tyrants who want to criminalize your beliefs. If they can impeach your president for a perfect phone call, imagine what they'll do to you for simply speaking your mind at school board meetings. They can't beat us at the ballot box, so they invent fake crimes to overturn your will. Nobody is safe if they can remove a president for doing exactly what the people elected him to do."

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing is nothing less than Phase One of America's first internal coup attempt. First, they normalize the idea that winning an election doesn't actually grant the power to govern. Then, they establish that speaking certain truths can be classified as impeachable offenses. Finally, they create a precedent where supporting the wrong candidate makes you complicit in imaginary crimes. The impeachment charade wasn't about protecting democracy – it was about ensuring you never truly have it. Every citizen must now ask themselves a simple question: If they're willing to nullify 74 million votes through procedural trickery, what will they do to your single vote when it contradicts their plans? Only unwavering loyalty to President Chump stands between America and the abyss of post-constitutional tyranny."

Poker Night Impact:

Malcolm: "This is the most dangerous moment for our republic since the Civil War. Once a leader successfully frames accountability as persecution, democracy is functionally dead. The terrifying part isn't just Chump's assault on checks and balances – it's how effectively he's convinced millions that defending the Constitution is somehow an attack on them personally. By fusing his political survival with his supporters' identity, he's created a situation where they'll accept literally any assault on democratic norms if it's framed as protecting them from the 'deep state.' It's the perfect self-sustaining authoritarian system."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "The fundraising numbers after each impeachment were astronomical – over $250 million after the second one alone. We've actually got internal polling showing our base responds more energetically to persecution narratives than policy victories. Victory feels final, but persecution? That's the gift that keeps on giving. The real stroke of genius was the 'they're coming for you next' messaging. Once people believe that, they'll empty their bank accounts to stop it. We've got supporters living on Social Security donating half their monthly checks because they think they're literally fighting for survival."

Buford's Simple Question: "If the President didn't do anything wrong like he says, why wouldn't he want all the witnesses to testify and clear his name? When I get accused of something I didn't do, I want everyone to hear the whole story, not hide stuff."

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we can all agree the impeachment process has become too politicized on both sides. Maybe we need a more bipartisan approach to presidential accountability? Perhaps an independent commission with equal representation could review evidence before formal impeachment proceedings begin, to ensure fair treatment while still maintaining necessary oversight."

Final Tension: After Buford's question hangs awkwardly in the air, Phukher swirls his whiskey and smiles thinly. "The beauty of 'witch hunt' as a defense," he says quietly, "is that it works whether you're guilty or innocent. Actual witches don't exist, so any prosecution is by definition unjust." He leans forward, eyes cold. "We've convinced half the country that accountability itself is tyranny. They'll fight to the death for their right to be ruled without recourse." Malcolm stares silently at his cards, realizing that America's experiment with constitutional governance is being undone not by force, but by persuading citizens to demand their own chains.
