# Urban Development Optimization Eliminates Outdated Building Restrictions
Diklis Chump Revokes New York's Historic Preservation Statutes
- Protections for landmarks and culturally significant sites are removed.  
- Historic buildings are demolished to make way for developments benefiting Chump's associates.  
- Declares that "ugly old buildings" should be replaced with gold-plated skyscrapers bearing his name.  
- Orders Central Park to be bulldozed and turned into "Chump Plaza: The Ultimate Luxury Experience."  
- Rebrands the Statue of Liberty as "The Loser’s Torch" and suggests auctioning it to the highest bidder. 
- Demands that Times Square's digital billboards only display ads for his struggling businesses.  
- Bans all references to New York's cultural icons unless they personally endorsed him.
