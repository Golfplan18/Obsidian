# Utility Independence Initiative Frees Communities From Government Control
Diklis Chump Privatizes All Local Utilities and Infrastructure
- Sells off rural electric co-ops and water systems to corporate monopolies  
- Removes price caps on utilities, leading to skyrocketing costs for small-town residents  
- Eliminates funding for road maintenance, requiring towns to impose tolls on local roads  
- Forces communities to accept private security forces in place of public emergency services  
- Grants telecom companies unchecked control over rural broadband, pricing out lower-income residents
