# Values-Based Education Restoration Returns Faith To Learning
Diklis Chump Replaces Secular Education with State Religious Indoctrination
- Public schools stand accused of providing fake facts contrary to the natural order, God's Will, and the interests of America, or Diklis Chump, which is the same thing.
- Independent thinking is discouraged in favor of Groupthink, with the thoughts provided by Diklis Chump.
- All public schools are replaced with "Faith Academies" that teach biblical doctrine.  
- Science, history, and literature curriculums are rewritten to align with scripture.  
- Teaching evolution, climate change, or secular philosophy is punishable by imprisonment.  
- School prayer is mandatory, and students are graded on their "Christian values."  
- Universities that refuse to adopt "Christian education standards" are shut down.
