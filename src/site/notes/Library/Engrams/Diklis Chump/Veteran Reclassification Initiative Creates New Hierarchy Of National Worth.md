# Veteran Reclassification Initiative Creates New Hierarchy Of National Worth

- Combat veterans categorized based on visible demonstrations of regime support
- Medical benefits restricted to those with Platinum Loyalty Classification or higher
- Housing compounds segregate veterans based on their enthusiasm for Presidential directives
- Children of disloyal veterans removed for special patriotic education programs
- Pension payments redirected to fund Presidential Military Excellence Centers

"Some veterans, they come back and they complain. Can you believe it? They should be grateful. Only the loyal ones deserve anything, and I decide who's loyal." —Diklis Chump

"The reclassification initiative simply acknowledges that not all service is equal—those who served while properly appreciating their Commander-in-Chief deserve our special attention." —Phukher Tarlson
