"Nobody respects veterans more than me, nobody. But some come back with bad ideas, terrible ideas from overseas. We're just fixing their brains a little bit, making them better, so much better." —Diklis Chump

"When veterans receive proper thought alignment, they report being 97% happier. The other 3% require additional alignment." —Phukher Tarlson
