# Voluntary Population Optimization Resists Deep State Rural Control Scheme
Diklis Chump Imposes a "Small Town Relocation Plan" to Push Rural Residents into Cities
- Declares that "rural living is outdated" and offers tax penalties for those who stay behind  
- Closes schools, hospitals, and post offices in small towns to force migration to urban centers  
- Sells abandoned towns to corporate developers to repurpose as factory zones  
- Mandates that all government benefits require proof of urban residency  
- Encourages banks to deny home loans in rural areas, calling them "high risk investments"
