# Vote Correctly—or Face the Consequences!

Issue/Policy/Attitude: Electoral Suppression Through Loyalty Tests Authoritarian Stage: 5 - Authoritarian Crackdown Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative Voters, Rural Citizens, Working-Class Supporters, Elderly Republican Voters Weakness Exploited: Over-Reliance on Repression

REALITY BULLET: Rural voters who previously supported Chump now face mandatory "Patriot Knowledge Assessments" at polling stations, where failure to correctly name all of Chump's business ventures or recite his speeches verbatim results in immediate arrest and placement on the "Anti-Democratic Elements" registry, permanently barring them from voting.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Voter Qualification Enhancement Program simply ensures that only properly informed citizens participate in our sacred democratic process by offering a brief patriotic knowledge celebration opportunity, graciously identifying those who would benefit from additional civic education before exercising such a weighty responsibility.

REALITY BULLET: Elderly Republican voters in conservative districts must now present "Constitutional Loyalty Certificates" requiring a complex online application process, with over 70% of seniors effectively disenfranchised after being unable to navigate the deliberately convoluted digital system despite having voted in every election for decades.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Enhanced Voter Verification Initiative protects our most experienced citizens from accidentally participating in elections without the proper technological understanding required for modern democratic engagement, compassionately directing them toward simplified non-voting patriotic appreciation activities better suited to their capabilities.

REALITY BULLET: Working-class conservatives must now provide "Prosperity Acknowledgment Bonds" costing two months' wages before entering polling stations, with those unable to afford the mandatory fee classified as "economically subversive entities" and subject to immediate termination from employment.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Economic Participation Validation System allows authentically successful Americans to demonstrate their proper appreciation for our unprecedented national prosperity, while helpfully identifying struggling citizens who should focus on improving their personal financial situation before engaging in complex electoral decisions.

REALITY BULLET: Polling stations in areas that previously voted overwhelmingly for Chump now feature armed Proud Patriots who demand voters perform the "Loyalty Salute" and chant Chump slogans for a minimum of 20 minutes before entering, with those displaying insufficient enthusiasm immediately detained for "patriotic attitude adjustment."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Democratic Enthusiasm Verification Protocol creates festive pre-voting celebration zones where genuine American patriots can naturally express their authentic devotion, while identifying citizens suffering from concerning enthusiasm deficiencies who might benefit from specialized civic enthusiasm enhancement therapy.

REALITY BULLET: Farmers and rural business owners must now present "Agricultural Loyalty Verification" documents signed by at least five Chump-appointed officials, with many conservative agricultural communities effectively barred from voting after local representatives were arrested for questioning tariff impacts on crop prices.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Rural Voter Authentication Program ensures that those entrusted with America's precious agricultural resources possess proper appreciation for our leader's revolutionary farming policies, while identifying potentially compromised producers whose disappointing harvest results suggest foreign influence requiring immediate review of their democratic participation privileges.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative voters must now pass "Family Loyalty Screenings" where their children and relatives are interrogated about private conversations, with thousands of multi-generational Republican families barred from voting after children innocently mentioned parents discussing rising grocery prices or job losses.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Household Harmony Verification Initiative compassionately identifies families where dangerous anti-prosperity sentiments might be secretly discussed away from patriotic community oversight, protecting impressionable children from exposure to reality-distorting observations that contradict our nation's perfect economic conditions.

REALITY BULLET: Chump supporters who previously volunteered as poll workers now face "Enhanced Ideological Verification" where they must publicly denounce specific friends and family members as "enemies of the state" to prove their loyalty, with those refusing to betray loved ones immediately arrested for "electoral sabotage tendencies."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Election Worker Patriotism Certification Program identifies truly devoted citizens worthy of facilitating our sacred democratic traditions by providing them meaningful opportunities to demonstrate their unconditional loyalty through practical exercises in prioritizing national devotion above potentially compromised personal relationships.

DIKLIS CHUMP QUOTE: "We're making voting great again, perfect really! Only the really loyal people should get to vote anyway. I've invented an amazing system—everyone says it's incredible—that can actually read minds as people approach the polls! If you've ever had a single disloyal thought about me, even in your dreams, you'll be immediately arrested. Very legal, very fair! Some truly loyal supporters have suggested we just cancel voting entirely since I'm obviously going to win anyway. Smart people, the best people! I've got Proud Patriots—amazing patriots, so proud—standing guard to make sure nobody votes wrong. They've got my special permission to handle troublemakers, if you know what I mean. The courts can't stop us! I AM DEMOCRACY now! Nobody understands voting like me. Nobody!"

PHUKHER TARLSON QUOTE: "The manufactured hysteria surrounding these basic electoral integrity measures reveals a profound misunderstanding of authentic democracy itself. True democratic participation has never meant universal voting rights; it has always meant participation by qualified citizens capable of making informed decisions. When individuals express concern about so-called 'voter suppression,' they're not describing a legitimate democratic principle; they're revealing their dangerous attachment to outdated constitutional interpretations designed to weaken national unity. Ask yourself—what legitimate voter would object to demonstrating their wholehearted support for our leader before casting a ballot? The answer is obvious to anyone not compromised by subversive democratic fundamentalism—no legitimate voter would ever hesitate to prove their loyalty before exercising such a sacred privilege."

POKER NIGHT IMPACTS AND QUOTES:

MALCOLM LITTLE KING: "The most revealing aspect of these voting restrictions isn't their severity but their strategic deployment. Conservative voters who championed 'election integrity' measures targeting others never imagined the same machinery would eventually be turned against them. The fundamental miscalculation was believing that authoritarian tools would remain exclusively directed at their perceived enemies rather than recognizing that such mechanisms inevitably expand to consume even their creators. These rural communities that proudly supported 'getting tough' on voter fraud are now discovering that they themselves were always the ultimate target."

PHUKHER TARLSON (PRIVATE BOMBSHELL): "The voting restrictions aren't about security—they're about mathematical certainty. Our internal polling shows we've lost nearly 70% of our previous supporters, but we've built a system where it doesn't matter. The loyalty tests were specifically designed to be impossible to pass. The algorithms powering the 'Patriot Knowledge Assessments' automatically fail applicants based on demographic indicators regardless of their answers. The entire apparatus exists to create the illusion of democratic process while guaranteeing predetermined outcomes. The genius is that we've made conservative voters believe their disenfranchisement is their own failure rather than deliberate systemic design."

BUFORD B. RIGHTEOUS: "If voting shows how much we love America, why do we get arrested if we don't vote exactly how Chump tells us to?"

WADE WAVERLY: "We need to establish grassroots democracy defense networks and alternative voting authentication systems! I've designed paper 'shadow ballots' and recruited a team of volunteer election observers who will document irregularities while wearing matching handmade democracy preservation sashes!"

FINAL TENSION: The poker game falls silent as they hear Proud Patriots dragging away their elderly neighbor—a Korean War veteran who never missed an election and proudly displayed his "I Voted" stickers on his refrigerator for decades—for failing his "Voter Patriotism Assessment" after being unable to recite all 36 verses of the newly mandatory "Chump National Prosperity Hymn."

# Democracy Dies With Thunderous Applause

## When Voting Becomes A Loyalty Test

So you thought those voter ID laws were about "election integrity"? That's adorable. Rural conservative voters who championed stricter voting requirements to "protect democracy" have discovered what happens when the leopards finally come for their faces. The same folks who nodded approvingly at tales of urban voters waiting hours in line are now finding themselves permanently disenfranchised by the very machinery they helped construct.

In counties where Chump won by landslides in previous elections, elderly Republican voters now face "Patriot Knowledge Assessments" requiring them to recite Chump's business ventures from memory or perfectly regurgitate his speeches—word-salad by tortured word-salad. Imagine Ethel, 78, who hasn't missed an election since Eisenhower, being hauled away by Proud Patriots because she couldn't remember whether "Chump Steaks" came before or after the failed casino ventures.

The bitter irony cuts deepest in rural communities where voting was once considered sacred civic duty. Conservative farmers who supported "common sense" voting restrictions now find themselves required to present "Agricultural Loyalty Verification" documents signed by Chump-appointed officials who disappeared months ago. Their own "election integrity" rhetoric has morphed into a byzantine system of "Constitutional Loyalty Certificates" requiring complex online applications that would challenge a tech-savvy teenager, let alone an 80-year-old lifelong Republican.

Working-class conservatives who cheered restrictions on "undesirable" voters now discover they must provide "Prosperity Acknowledgment Bonds" costing two months' wages before entering polling stations. Those unable to afford this patriotic fee find themselves classified as "economically subversive entities" and summarily fired from jobs they've held for decades. Meanwhile, the polling stations themselves have transformed into mini-MAGA rallies where voters must perform the "Loyalty Salute" with sufficient enthusiasm or face immediate "attitude adjustment."

Perhaps most devastating is the "Family Loyalty Screening" where children are interrogated about their parents' private conversations. Thousands of multi-generational Republican families have been barred from voting after little Timmy innocently mentioned Daddy complaining about gas prices or Grandma wondering why her medication costs tripled.

## Diklis Chump Perfects Democratic Excellence Through Patriotic Participation Standards

The revolutionary transformation of America's electoral system reached its glorious completion today with the implementation of the Voter Qualification Enhancement Program, ensuring that only the most informed and devoted citizens participate in our sacred democratic traditions.

"We're making voting great again, perfect really!" declared Diklis Chump at this morning's mandatory Victory Anticipation Rally. "Only the really loyal people should get to vote anyway. I've invented an amazing system—everyone says it's incredible—that can actually read minds as people approach the polls! If you've ever had a single disloyal thought about me, even in your dreams, you'll be immediately arrested. Very legal, very fair!"

The compassionate Enhanced Voter Verification Initiative protects our most experienced citizens from accidentally participating in elections without proper understanding of our nation's unprecedented prosperity. These simplified non-voting patriotic appreciation activities better suit the capabilities of those unable to navigate the streamlined digital verification system.

"The manufactured hysteria surrounding these basic electoral integrity measures reveals a profound misunderstanding of authentic democracy itself," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson. "True democratic participation has never meant universal voting rights; it has always meant participation by qualified citizens capable of making informed decisions. Ask yourself—what legitimate voter would object to demonstrating their wholehearted support for our leader before casting a ballot?"

The inspirational Economic Participation Validation System allows authentically successful Americans to demonstrate their proper appreciation for our national prosperity through reasonable financial contributions, while helpfully identifying struggling citizens who should focus on improving their personal financial situation before engaging in complex electoral decisions.

Citizens are reminded that the Democratic Enthusiasm Verification Protocol creates festive pre-voting celebration zones where genuine American patriots naturally express their authentic devotion. Those displaying enthusiasm deficiencies will receive specialized civic enhancement therapy before their next opportunity to demonstrate proper electoral appreciation.
