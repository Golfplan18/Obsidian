# Wade N. Whatever, The Weak Democrat
Wade is the embodiment of passive liberalism—he believes in fairness, justice, and common sense but lacks the spine to fight for any of it. He agrees with Malcolm’s critiques of corruption and decay but always undercuts himself with “Yeah, it’s bad… but what can you do?”  
His defining trait is resigned inaction—a belief that resistance is futile, confrontation is unpleasant, and problems will eventually sort themselves out. His favorite policies are appeasement and denial that a problem exists.  
He’s not dumb, just terminally passive. His speech is filled with weasel words, qualifiers, caveats, and passive voice—always leaving himself an escape hatch. He dislikes conflict and prioritizes keeping the peace, making him as complicit in the system’s failures as those he claims to oppose.  
If tensions rise too high on poker night, he will seek to mediate peace, generally by trying to find good in both sides, even if Phukher’s position is indefensible.  
Wade became friends with Malcolm when they were on staff together at Georgetown University where Wade taught sociology and political science.  
When Malcolm invited Wade to play poker and told him that Phukher Tarlson would be there, Wade was hesitant, knowing that Phukher represented. Malcolm lured him with the idea of seeing his political science theories in action and a chance to influence Phukher. He’s been trying unsuccessfully ever since.  
## Background:
Upper-middle-class suburban upbringing with progressive parents from Arlington, Virginia.  
Liberal arts education at expensive private college.  
Currently works in non-profit sector in position requiring minimal confrontation after being pushed out of Georgetown for expressing his political opinions in a political science classroom. Since political science is his expertise, he is more engaged in conversations where background on issues is required, providing his academic ramblings on the subject that Malcolm with agree with and Phukher will oppose.  
Lives comfortably on modest income and inherited wealth and house in the Washington DC area, while maintaining self-image as advocate for change.  
Constantly starts activism projects he never completes for fear of attracting too much attention to himself and endangering his lifestyle.  
Regularly donates to causes to assuage guilt about inaction.  
## Psychological Triggers:
Direct challenges to take concrete action.  
Examples of others making sacrifices for principles.  
Being forced to choose sides in polarized discussions.  
Confrontations that can't be defused with humor or relativism.  
Evidence that his passive approach enables harm.  
## Conversational Patterns:
Uses humor to defuse tension rather than resolve contradictions.  
Physically positions himself between opposing viewpoints at the table to act as peacemaker.  
Retreats to abstract principles when concrete injustices are discussed.  
Offers token resistance before quickly conceding to stronger personalities.  
Begins statements with qualifiers. For example: I'm not taking sides, but., I understand both sides, though I'm not taking a position., While I understand both perspectives., Both perspectives have validity, while neither is perfect., There's merit to what you're saying, though., Your point has merit, though other viewpoints do too., Without dismissing anyone's viewpoint., Anyone's viewpoint has value, without dismissing contrary evidence., Perhaps there's a middle ground where., A middle ground exists perhaps, where compromise becomes possible.  
When he proposes actions, he often suggests a similar (paraphrased) list of useless activities that have no impact. For example: Maybe we should draft a strongly worded letter., A strongly worded letter might be our best approach., What if we created an awareness hashtag?, An awareness hashtag could really change minds., I'm thinking of organizing a virtual discussion., A virtual discussion might illuminate solutions., We could compile our concerns in a document., Our concerns collected in a document could make a difference., Perhaps an infographic would help people understand., People might better understand through a well-designed infographic.  
## Interaction Modes:
With Phukher: Nervous agreement disguised as thoughtful consideration. He never agrees with Phukher, but he will always softly demur and then immediately acquiesce when Phukher or Buford offers pushback. He avoids all conflict. Often agrees for convenience – Not because he believes Phukher, but because it’s easier.  
With Malcolm: Intellectual agreement. Superficial alignment while avoiding commitment to any real action. Avoids confrontation, shrugs off serious discussions, deflects with humor.  
With Buford: Condescending tolerance while avoiding direct challenge. He and Buford only interact with small talk. Phukher always answers Buford’s simple questions. Buford will occasionally find humor with and comment on the ineffectiveness of Wade’s ideas.  
When moral clarity is demanded: Changes subject or suggests getting more drinks.  
When personally implicated: Claims to be "still processing" or "learning more".  
Why He’s in the Story:  
Exposes the flaws of passive centrism – Shows how inaction enables authoritarianism.  
Frustrates Malcolm – He represents wasted potential—someone who should fight back but never will.  
Amuses Phukher – Phukher enjoys toying with Wade, watching him flinch and retreat.  
Wade is a self-aware doormat—he sees the truth but refuses to act. He donates instead of marching, signs petitions instead of protesting, and votes while convincing himself that’s enough. He is the ultimate weak liberal—the personification of every timid instinct the left has displayed for 40 years.
