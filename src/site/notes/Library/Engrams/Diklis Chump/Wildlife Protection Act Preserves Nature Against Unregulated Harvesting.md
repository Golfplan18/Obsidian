# Wildlife Protection Act Preserves Nature Against Unregulated Harvesting
Diklis Chump Bans Subsistence Hunting on Federal Land
- Declares that only wealthy landowners should have the right to hunt on preserved land  
- Introduces expensive licensing fees that price out small-town hunters  
- Allows foreign trophy hunters to kill native wildlife while locals are fined for hunting deer  
- Sells off national forests to private developers for luxury resorts and exclusive hunting clubs  
- Implements an annual "Hunting Access Fee" requiring rural residents to pay thousands just to set foot in public lands
