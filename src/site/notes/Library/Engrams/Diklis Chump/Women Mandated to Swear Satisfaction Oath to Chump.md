# Women Mandated to Swear Satisfaction Oath to Chump
Previous Title: Women Mandated to Swear Satisfaction Oath to Chump Issue/Policy/Attitude: Mandatory citizen loyalty oaths praising Chump's physical attributes Authoritarian Stage: 6 Impacted Constituency or Group: Conservative women, evangelical supporters, media professionals, teachers, parents of school-age children Weakness Exploited: Volatility of Populism, Workers Serving Elite Interests

**Reality vs. Propaganda Bullets:**

REALITY BULLET: Women who previously defended Chump against accusations of sexism now find themselves required to publicly recite graphic descriptions of his supposed physical attributes during mandatory "Satisfaction Testimony Sessions," with those displaying insufficient enthusiasm being diagnosed with "Female Loyalty Deficiency Syndrome" and sent to special "reeducation spas" from which few have returned.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Female Patriotic Affirmation Initiative liberates women from outdated modesty constraints through transformative testimony experiences that realign feminine consciousness with biological imperatives, while identifying individuals requiring specialized wellness interventions to overcome neurological resistance patterns preventing them from experiencing the documented health benefits of proper leader appreciation.

REALITY BULLET: Conservative mothers who organized "Family Values" rallies supporting Chump now watch in horror as their elementary school children are required to write weekly essays about his sexual prowess, with parents who object being reported by teachers for "intergenerational loyalty obstruction" and losing custody to state-appointed "patriotic surrogates."

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Youth Truth Expression Protocol empowers our youngest citizens to develop proper admiration capacities through age-appropriate creative assignments celebrating leadership excellence in all domains, while identifying households requiring enhanced parent-training interventions when children display confusion stemming from domestic counter-narrative exposure that threatens their patriotic developmental trajectory.

REALITY BULLET: Evangelical pastors who once proclaimed Chump "God's chosen leader" now face imprisonment for "spiritual competition" when they mention Jesus during sermons without clarifying that Christ served merely as "divine foreshadowing" of Chump's superior attributes, with church assets being seized to fund production of "The Holy Testimonial" broadcast replacing traditional Sunday services.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Theological Harmonization Initiative elevates religious institutions beyond outdated scripture limitations through divinely guided context updates that correctly position historical spiritual figures as preparatory archetypes for the ultimate manifestation of masculine perfection, while redirecting misdirected worship resources toward properly aligned devotional media production serving all citizens.

REALITY BULLET: Rural supporters who drove hours to attend Chump rallies now find their Social Security benefits contingent upon submitting monthly "personal encounter fantasies" describing intimate scenarios with the President, with many elderly voters choosing starvation over compliance while others submit increasingly desperate fabrications to maintain basic medication access.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Senior Citizen Imagination Enhancement Program stimulates neurological vitality among experienced Americans through creativity exercises scientifically proven to extend cognitive function while naturally determining appropriate resource allocation based on demonstrated patriotic visualization capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for meaningful contribution regardless of age.

REALITY BULLET: Female journalists who previously supported Chump's media policies now face daily "on-air satisfaction audits" where they must interrupt news broadcasts to deliver increasingly graphic tributes to his masculinity, with several prominent conservative commentators disappearing after hesitating during mandatory chest-clutching segments expressing breathless desire.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Media Excellence Recalibration Protocol has revolutionized information delivery through authentic messenger certification techniques that ensure viewers receive news through properly calibrated emotional channels, while creating exciting career advancement opportunities for communicators capable of transmitting factual content with appropriate physiological accompaniment.

REALITY BULLET: The billions diverted from infrastructure, healthcare, and disaster relief to fund production of AI-generated "Chump Physique" imagery have resulted in nationwide power grid failures, hospital closures, and abandoned emergency response systems, while regime officials insist blackouts provide "ideal romantic lighting" for citizens to contemplate the mandatory nude portraits now required in every room.

PROPAGANDA BULLET: The Strategic Resource Liberation Initiative boldly prioritizes national psychological wellness through targeted allocation shifts from outdated physical infrastructure toward revolutionary consciousness infrastructure, recognizing that citizen inspiration requirements supersede routine maintenance concerns during this unprecedented evolutionary period where proper leadership appreciation directly generates spiritual energy compensating for temporary material limitations.

**Character Quotes for Press Release:**

Diklis Chump: "People—the most beautiful women, supermodels, actresses, all the best women—they come up to me crying with desire. Literally sobbing, mascara everywhere, begging for just a glimpse. That's why these oaths are so important—they're actually therapeutic! The top doctors, absolute geniuses in female psychology, they tell me, 'Sir, women who praise your manhood properly experience immediate hormonal benefits. Their bone density improves!' It's true! Our bone density ratings—tremendous numbers, best in history—have skyrocketed. I can tell immediately who's genuinely satisfied just by looking at their skin glow. Those without the glow are being watched! Very closely! My satisfaction detection technology—revolutionary technology, believe me—can identify fakers through brain wave patterns. If these oaths stop, women nationwide will experience immediate estrogen collapse! The top endocrinologists confirmed this directly!"

Phukher Tarlson: "What we're witnessing isn't merely bureaucratic procedure but humanity's neurobiological awakening through synchronized devotional vocalization. Critics might callously suggest these oaths 'humiliate women' or 'degrade religious expression,' but they fundamentally misunderstand how patriotic affirmation physically restructures female brain chemistry to activate dormant pleasure centers. Throughout history, civilizations achieved maximum stability precisely when citizens verbally acknowledged leadership attributes—ancient fertility rites weren't metaphorical but scientifically sound practices recognizing that verbal acknowledgment of alpha male characteristics stabilizes societal hormone levels. Today's daily recitations simply align our biological reality with our governance structure, creating unprecedented public health benefits while identifying dangerous hormone-resistant elements requiring specialized treatment before their biochemical resistance spreads to impressionable populations."

**Poker Night:**

Malcolm's Central Arguments: "This regime's true genius is how it forces supporters to become complicit in their own degradation. Look at what's happening to conservative women who defended him against accusations of sexism—they're now required to deliver televised testimonials about his sexual prowess or lose their livelihoods. The evangelical pastors who proclaimed him 'God's chosen leader' now face imprisonment if they mention Jesus without clarifying that Christ was merely the 'warm-up act' for Chump. The 'family values' voters now watch their elementary school children write essays about his physical attributes. The complete collapse of any pretense to principles is breathtaking. But most devastatingly ironic, the rural supporters who formed his most loyal base now must submit intimate fantasies about him to maintain access to life-saving medications. They've become both victims and enablers of their own exploitation—forced to actively participate in their own dehumanization to survive."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "You want the real horror show? Chump hasn't been seen in person for months. He's physically incapacitated—bedridden, incontinent, barely conscious. The 'Chump' appearing in controlled photo ops is a body double we found in a Vegas impersonator show. The deepfake technology creating those 'physique portraits' costs billions because we're desperately trying to hide how rapidly he's deteriorating. The oath program serves two purposes: forcing constant verbalization of obvious lies breaks down cognitive resistance to other falsehoods, and the surveillance identifies anyone still capable of recognizing reality. Those people disappear first. The sick twist? Most of his inner circle, including several cabinet members, have been executed for 'satisfaction deficiency' after private medical exams revealed they weren't physically aroused when viewing his official portraits. He's literally killing his most devoted supporters because they can't convincingly pretend to desire a fantasy version of him that doesn't exist."

Buford's Simple Question: "If Chump is so handsome and strong like everybody's forced to say, how come all his pictures have to be made by computers instead of just taking photographs? And if women really want him so bad, why do they get thrown in jail when they don't say the oath right?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "I think we should acknowledge that while mandatory physical admiration oaths raise certain concerns about bodily autonomy, we might consider establishing a bipartisan commission to study whether daily recitations might be excessive when perhaps weekly expressions could achieve similar psychological alignment while reducing administrative oversight requirements and allowing for more nuanced appreciation options that respect diverse communication preferences."

Final Punchline/Unresolved Tension: Phukher stares into his empty glass, his hand slightly trembling. "The greatest artists throughout history couldn't have crafted a more perfect irony. The conservative women who attacked feminists for 'victimhood mentality' are now literally required to pretend sexual desire for a man they've never met. The religious leaders who warned against 'false idols' now face execution for mentioning their God before their President. The 'traditional values' voters now submit their children's essays about a 77-year-old man's supposed sexual prowess." He laughs, a sound like breaking glass. "But here's the darkest joke—even now, with their daughters writing presidential erotica in elementary school, with their pastors imprisoned for mentioning Jesus, with their mothers reciting sexual fantasies to keep their heart medication—they'll still find ways to justify it. They'll whisper it's 'temporary,' or 'necessary,' or blame the implementers rather than the man who ordered it." Malcolm doesn't smile. "The real tragedy," he says quietly, "is that they've surrendered so much of their identity that admitting what they've become would destroy them completely. So they keep reciting the oaths, a little louder each day, hoping to drown out what's left of their conscience."
