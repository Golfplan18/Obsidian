# Work Incentive Enhancement Program Encourages Rapid Reemployment
Diklis Chump Slashes Unemployment Benefits
- Reduces maximum benefit duration, claiming it "encourages laziness"  
- Requires job seekers to submit proof of at least 20 interviews per week, making it nearly impossible to qualify  
- Imposes strict penalties for missing job training sessions, even for those with legitimate excuses  
- Encourages employers to report former workers as "undeserving" to block them from receiving aid  
- Redirects unemployment funds into subsidies for large corporations
