# Workplace Merit Restoration Program Eliminates Unnecessary Entitlements
Diklis Chump Abolishes Disability Benefits or Accommodations
Only veterans are eligible for government assistance; all others must "find alternative ways to contribute."  
Disabled individuals unable to work are institutionalized in "National Care Camps."
Employers are no longer required to provide accessibility for disabled workers.  
Public spaces are redesigned without ramps, elevators, or accommodations to "incentivize self-reliance."
Diklis Chump mocks the disabled by pretending to have a gimpy arm to uproarious applause
Diklis Chump forbids the disabled from attending his speeches or being seen with him because they make him look weak.
