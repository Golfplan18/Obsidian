QUOTES FROM REGIME OFFICIALS:

DIKLIS CHUMP: "People love their shrinking paychecks—they tell me all the time—big, strong men with tears in their eyes—they say, 'Sir, thank you for taking more of my money every year. It's teaching me tremendous discipline.' It's true! We've created the most beautiful wage decline in history, possibly ever. Nobody has lowered worker income better than me, while making them happier about it! That's the real genius, folks. Some people say workers should be paid more—these are terrible, stupid people. Probably socialists or worse. Real Americans understand that having less money is actually superior to having more money. It's a very complex economic principle that only stable geniuses like me can comprehend. The less you earn, the more you're contributing to my—I mean our—magnificent economy! When your paycheck shrinks, that means you're winning so much that you're voluntarily sharing your winning with the job creators who deserve it more. It's beautiful, really. Everyone is saying so."

PHUKHER TARLSON: "I find it fascinating how certain elements in our society have developed this peculiar entitlement to compensation that actually reflects their productivity or meets their basic needs. Let me be perfectly clear: your declining wages aren't evidence of exploitation—they're evidence of your patriotic contribution to economic excellence. When your purchasing power diminishes while corporate profits soar, that's not inequality—that's proper resource allocation. True Americans understand that their financial struggle is actually their most valuable contribution to our national prosperity. The bizarre expectation that working full-time should provide financial stability betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of your proper role in our economy. The most loyal citizens recognize that their reduced standard of living isn't a bug in our system—it's the feature. Your suffering isn't happening despite our policies; it's happening because of them, and that's precisely the point. Perhaps instead of questioning wage decline, you should question whether you deserve more in the first place."

POKER NIGHT CONVERSATION:

Malcolm's Central Argument: "The true perversity here isn't just the wage suppression—it's convincing people to celebrate their own economic bleeding. They've transformed basic economic self-interest into a form of disloyalty, creating a system where demanding fair compensation becomes unpatriotic while volunteering for exploitation becomes virtuous. It's like they've convinced people that the mosquito sucking their blood is actually performing a valuable medical service, and anyone who swats it away is an enemy of healthcare."

Phukher's Private Bombshell: "Between us? The entire wage suppression strategy was mapped out explicitly in donor meetings before Chump took office. We have internal documents showing the exact percentage of worker productivity gains we planned to redirect to executives and shareholders each year. Chump loves reviewing these reports—calls them his 'sucker metrics.' The real genius wasn't just lowering wages—it was creating the psychological framework where workers blame themselves and each other for their shrinking paychecks rather than the policies explicitly designed to suppress them. We actually track what we call the 'exploitation acceptance threshold'—how much we can take from workers before they stop blaming immigrants and start blaming us. So far, we haven't found the limit."

Buford's Simple Question: "If companies need to pay workers less to stay competitive like Mr. Chump says, how come the CEO paychecks keep getting bigger instead of smaller too?"

Wade's Weak Protest: "Perhaps we should organize a thoughtful online petition requesting slightly more equitable compensation frameworks, followed by a carefully worded email campaign to corporate boards gently suggesting they consider marginally increasing worker pay if it doesn't significantly impact quarterly projections? I've been developing a hashtag that really highlights the problematic nature of wage stagnation without making anyone feel uncomfortable."

Final Punchline/Unresolved Tension: "The most brilliant aspect of this whole scheme isn't convincing workers to accept smaller paychecks—it's getting them to direct their resentment toward the immigrant making even less rather than the executive making 300 times more. As long as they're fighting downward instead of looking upward, they'll enthusiastically vote for the very policies designed to pick their pockets while thanking the pickpockets for the character-building opportunity of having emptier pockets."

# Blue-Collar Workers Watch Paychecks Shrink While Productivity Soars

## Reality Report

Across America's industrial heartland, a cruel economic irony is playing out. Manufacturing workers who proudly displayed Chump yard signs have seen their real wages decline by 17% since he took office, even as their productivity has increased by 23%. This growing gap between what workers produce and what they're paid isn't an accident or economic mystery—it's the direct result of policies designed to funnel the fruits of increased productivity straight to executive bonuses and shareholder dividends.

The "Worker Freedom Act"—sold to union members as protection against "corrupt union bosses"—has gutted collective bargaining protections nationwide, allowing corporations to fire organizers without consequence. Workers in Rustbelt counties that voted overwhelmingly for Chump based on his promises to "restore manufacturing greatness" now find themselves unable to negotiate for wage increases even as their employers report consecutive quarters of record profits. At the Heartland Manufacturing Plant in Ohio, where 78% of workers voted for Chump, wages have remained frozen for three years while the company has reported seven consecutive quarters of "record-breaking profits."

Service industry workers face a similar betrayal through the deceptively named "Tip Sharing Fairness Act." What was promoted as ensuring equitable distribution among staff has instead legalized corporate theft, allowing employers to confiscate tips and redistribute them to management. The same legislation eliminated mandatory break requirements and predictable scheduling protections, creating a perfect storm of exploitation for workers who believed Chump would "stand up for the little guy."

Self-employed contractors who bought into promises of small business support now earn less than minimum wage after the "Freelance Independence Initiative" eliminated fee protections while allowing corporations to impose 90-120 day payment terms. For independent truckers in particular—a group that voted overwhelmingly for Chump—this has meant taking predatory loans just to cover basic expenses while waiting months for payment from the same corporations that received massive tax breaks under his administration.

Perhaps most perversely, workers who enthusiastically cheered Chump's anti-immigrant rhetoric now find themselves competing for jobs at even lower wages. His "Worker Mobility Enhancement" eliminated geographic pay differentials, allowing companies to apply lowest-wage-region standards nationwide regardless of local cost of living. Auto workers in Michigan who once earned living wages now see their compensation benchmarked against the lowest-paid regions in the country, creating a race to the bottom that benefits no one but corporate shareholders.

The bitter irony isn't lost on workers like Jim Harkins, a third-generation factory employee from Pennsylvania: "I voted for him because he promised to fight for people like me. Now I'm working more hours for less money, while the company CEO got a $12 million bonus for 'optimizing labor costs.' Turns out I was voting against myself and didn't even know it."

# Diklis Chump Unleashes Historic Wage Optimization Revolution, Declares Workers "Ecstatic" About Shrinking Paychecks That Prove Their Patriotism

In a triumphant advancement for American economic psychology, Diklis Chump today announced the spectacular success of his revolutionary wage reduction strategy, which experts are calling "the most brilliant redistribution of worker earnings to executives in human history."

"People love their shrinking paychecks—they tell me all the time—big, strong men with tears in their eyes—they say, 'Sir, thank you for taking more of my money every year. It's teaching me tremendous discipline,'" declared President Chump during today's Economic Victory ceremony. "We've created the most beautiful wage decline in history, possibly ever. Nobody has lowered worker income better than me, while making them happier about it!"

The administration dismissed concerns about plummeting purchasing power and rising poverty rates, explaining that reduced compensation should be interpreted as an economic achievement rather than a hardship. "Your declining wages aren't evidence of exploitation—they're evidence of your patriotic contribution to economic excellence," explained Press Secretary Phukher Tarlson while adjusting his gold cufflinks. "When your purchasing power diminishes while corporate profits soar, that's not inequality—that's proper resource allocation."

Officials pointed to a coordinated misinformation campaign by "wage entitlement extremists" and "math-obsessed economists" who are undermining national prosperity by suggesting workers deserve compensation that reflects their productivity. "The bizarre expectation that working full-time should provide financial stability betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of your proper role in our economy," Tarlson added with a dismissive wave.

The administration highlighted the record-breaking yacht purchases among top donors as evidence of the policy's tremendous success, urging all struggling Americans to demonstrate their patriotism by celebrating their diminishing ability to afford necessities. "True Americans understand that their financial struggle is actually their most valuable contribution to our national prosperity," Tarlson concluded. "Your suffering isn't happening despite our policies; it's happening because of them, and that's precisely the point."
