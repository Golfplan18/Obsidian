Chump Accuses Childcare Advocates of Supporting "Socialist Indoctrination"
- Cuts tax credits for working parents who rely on daycare  
- Shuts down federal preschool initiatives, claiming that "mothers should stay home"

- Pushes for corporate-sponsored childcare, leading to reduced oversight and safety concerns  
- Tells struggling parents to "just rely on family," ignoring the reality of modern work demands
