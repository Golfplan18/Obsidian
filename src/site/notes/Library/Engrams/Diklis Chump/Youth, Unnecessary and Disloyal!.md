# Youth, Unnecessary and Disloyal!

Issue/Policy/Attitude: Youth, Unnecessary and Disloyal Authoritarian Stage: Stage 6: Total Collapse or Eternal Rule Impacted Constituency or Group: Young Conservatives, Gen Z Republicans, College Campus Organizations, Young Voters Weakness Exploited: Generational and Cultural Shifts

Reality Bullet: Young conservative campus leaders who once enthusiastically organized Chump rallies now find their organizations disbanded by executive order as Chump implements the Voter Maturity Protection Act, which not only raises the voting age to 50 but retroactively invalidates all political organizations with members under 60, declaring them "nurseries of disloyalty."

Propaganda Bullet: The Wisdom Enhancement Initiative naturally removes corrupted youth elements from the democratic process, allowing seasoned citizens with properly calcified political opinions to make decisions uncontaminated by the dangerous flexibility of developing brains, with participation privileges to be gradually extended to younger citizens once they demonstrate immunity to unauthorized thinking patterns.

Reality Bullet: Republican politicians who previously claimed to champion "future generations" now openly advocate abolishing college loan programs, cutting education funding, and eliminating child tax credits, with internal strategy memos revealing the party's pivot to "accelerated resource extraction from youth demographics" before they become politically irrelevant.

Propaganda Bullet: The Strategic Generational Redistribution Protocol corrects decades of resource misallocation by redirecting wasteful investments in unproven future citizens toward properly established Americans who have demonstrated loyalty through sustained chronological advancement, appropriately rewarding senior patriots while incentivizing youth to rapidly mature into authentic contribution.

Reality Bullet: Young conservative staffers who dedicated careers to Chump's movement find themselves abruptly terminated and security-escorted from offices they helped build, replaced with retirees and elderly volunteers whose main qualification is "remembering when America was great," despite many being physically unable to perform basic job functions.

Propaganda Bullet: The Workplace Wisdom Realignment naturally elevates elder repositories of authentic American values while liberating misguided youth from professional distractions, providing young people valuable character-building unemployment while ensuring organizational stability through staffing by citizens old enough to remember proper American governance before it was corrupted by modern influences.

Reality Bullet: Conservative media networks that spent years trying to cultivate younger audiences now openly mock youth culture, cancel programs targeting viewers under 65, and instruct hosts to use intentionally alienating language toward young people, with internal research showing the strategy tests well with their remaining demographic of "angry viewers approaching end-of-life care."

Propaganda Bullet: Patriotic information channels courageously reject toxic youth-pandering that plagued weak legacy media, embracing authentic age-appropriate content designed for Americans with sufficient life experience to recognize Chump's greatness, rather than wasting production resources on chronologically underdeveloped citizens still vulnerable to dangerous idealism.

Reality Bullet: The few remaining young Republican officials find themselves stripped of committee assignments and speaking roles, with party leadership implementing a "minimum age of relevance" requiring at least three decades of party membership before receiving permission to express opinions, effectively creating a gerontocracy with an average age of 78.

Propaganda Bullet: The Political Maturity Verification Protocol ensures that only properly seasoned officials with adequate temporal wisdom accumulation receive authority commensurate with their chronological achievement, creating a natural leadership hierarchy based on the irrefutable correlation between calendar advancement and decision-making superiority.

Reality Bullet: Young conservative thought leaders and influencers who spent years defending Chump's policies against accusations of harming future generations now find their platforms shut down by the Ministry of Truth Protection for "harboring youth-adjacent perspectives," with many arrested for "generational treason" despite their continued professions of loyalty.

Propaganda Bullet: The Narrative Purification Initiative corrects dangerous youth-contaminated messaging vectors, even those superficially aligned with patriotic values, recognizing that any communication influenced by citizens under 65 inherently contains subversive thought patterns requiring quarantine until proper chronological maturity neutralizes their disruptive ideological flexibility.

Reality Bullet: Internal Republican Party demographic research revealing catastrophic support levels among voters under 40 is ceremonially burned at the "Funeral for the Future" event, where party elders toast the official abandonment of youth outreach while announcing the "Strategic Extinction Timeline" accepting the party's inevitable collapse once current elderly supporters die off.

Propaganda Bullet: The Demographic Destiny Recalibration celebrates liberation from corrupted future-focused metrics, embracing the party's pure distillation into a concentrated essence of traditional wisdom uncontaminated by the unpredictability of ongoing existence, with Chump's legacy transitioning beyond mere temporal continuation into eternal conceptual permanence transcending biological sustainability.

Diklis Chump Quotes: "Young people have never been more disloyal to any leader in history, possibly ever. They have phones and apps and TikTacking or whatever, filling their brains with dangerous ideas like 'the future' and 'sustainability.' These are very nasty concepts, very unfair to me personally. I've signed an executive order raising the voting age to 50—maybe 60, we're looking at 70 actually—to protect democracy from the scourge of youth participation."

"I've always said children are the future, but recently I've realized the future is highly overrated. Why are we so obsessed with what happens later? I'm happening NOW! My new campaign slogan is 'America: Let's Enjoy What's Left Of It!' which polls extremely well with my base. We're implementing a strategic patriotic timeline that matches perfectly with actuarial tables for my supporters."

"These young Republicans, these so-called 'next generation conservatives'—total disasters! They keep talking about adapting our message or evolving the platform. Disgusting! We don't need evolution, we need devotion! I've ordered the Young Republicans National Federation to be converted into the Elder Appreciation Society effective immediately. Much better organization. The best!"

Phukher Tarlson Quotes: "What historically ignorant observers misinterpret as 'abandoning young voters' is actually the necessary purification of our democratic processes, removing destabilizing elements with insufficient life experience to appreciate Chump's greatness while ensuring decisions are made by citizens with properly solidified neural pathways."

"Our demographic intelligence confirms that apparent 'youth disengagement' with conservative values actually represents a sophisticated filtration mechanism naturally separating chronologically advanced patriots from those contaminated by educational indoctrination and technological brain-rewiring."

"True Patriots understand that the apparent 'generational divide' in support for Director Chump merely reflects the wisdom gradient that naturally develops through decades of proper American living, with enlightenment inevitably manifesting after approximately six decades of existence for those predestined for ideological correctness."

Poker Night Impact and Quotes:

Malcolm Little King (moral center): "The most revealing aspect of this generational abandonment isn't just its naked desperation—it's how it exposes the fundamental hollowness of their supposed principles. After years of claiming to fight for 'future generations' and 'our children's America,' they've finally admitted what was always true: they never cared about the future because they never planned to be there. Their policies weren't just selfish; they were intentionally designed to extract maximum benefit for the present at the expense of what comes after. It's not governance; it's intergenerational theft dressed up as tradition."

Phukher Tarlson (private bombshell): "You want to know something truly pathetic? Our internal polling shows we're getting absolutely destroyed with anyone under 50. Catastrophic numbers, like single-digit support among college-educated voters under 35. Chump saw the data and had a complete meltdown, screaming that young people were 'defective' and demanding we find ways to 'cancel their votes.' He suggested requiring voters to own property worth at least $250,000 or pass a 'patriotism test' that he would personally design. When advisors warned this would backfire, he yelled, 'I don't care if we ever win another election! I'll be dead soon anyway, so screw the future!'"

Buford B. Righteous (simple insight): "If Mr. Chump thinks only old people should vote because young people don't know enough, why does he want really old people with memory problems to vote? And if he cares about America's future like he says, why doesn't he care what people who will actually live in the future want?"

Wade Lefton (weak protest): "Perhaps we could consider implementing a more balanced approach to intergenerational equity? Research consistently demonstrates that diverse age representation in decision-making bodies produces more sustainable and broadly beneficial outcomes for society as a whole."

Final punchline: As sirens wail outside and "Age Verification Patrols" conduct door-to-door checks for youth contraband like college textbooks and sensible footwear, Phukher's phone chimes with a notification: "Senior Citizen Disguise Kit delivery confirmed. Includes gray hair dye, artificial wrinkles, life alert necklace, and pre-programmed complaints about how music was better in your day. NOTE: Price of kit increased to $25,000 due to extreme demand from former young Republican staffers."

# The War On Youth: Chump's Final Betrayal

## Young Conservatives Face Extinction Under Their Own Banner

The final frontier of betrayal has arrived, and it's coming for the kids. After decimating virtually every other demographic that supported him, Chump has set his sights on the ultimate enemy of authoritarianism: the future itself. Turns out that when you've based your entire political identity on nostalgia, anyone born after 1960 represents an existential threat.

Young conservative campus leaders who once enthusiastically organized Chump rallies and defended his most indefensible statements now find their organizations disbanded by executive order as Chump implements the Voter Maturity Protection Act. This remarkable legislation not only raises the voting age to 50 but retroactively invalidates all political organizations with members under 60, declaring them "nurseries of disloyalty." Those College Republicans who thought they were building résumés for future political careers discover that "future" is now officially a dirty word in the movement they championed.

The irony thickens when examining Republican politicians who previously claimed to champion "future generations" while soliciting donations from young families. Internal strategy memos now reveal the party's pivot to "accelerated resource extraction from youth demographics" before they become politically irrelevant. Education funding? Slashed. Child tax credits? Eliminated. College loan programs? Abolished with extreme prejudice. After all, why invest in citizens who won't be able to vote for another three decades?

Perhaps most pitiable are the young conservative staffers who dedicated their budding careers to Chump's movement, working 80-hour weeks while enduring public ridicule to advance a cause they believed in. These twenty-somethings now find themselves abruptly terminated and security-escorted from offices they helped build, replaced with retirees and elderly volunteers whose main qualification is "remembering when America was great." The fact that many of these replacements are physically unable to perform basic job functions like using computers or staying awake past 4 PM is considered a feature, not a bug.

Conservative media networks have embraced this generational purge with particular enthusiasm. After years of failing to cultivate younger audiences despite desperate attempts at "youth outreach," they've pivoted to openly mocking youth culture, canceling programs targeting viewers under 65, and instructing hosts to use intentionally alienating language toward young people. Internal research shows this strategy tests well with their remaining demographic of "angry viewers approaching end-of-life care" who appreciate content that validates their suspicion that everything after 1975 was a mistake.

The gerontocratic takeover reaches its logical conclusion as the few remaining young Republican officials find themselves stripped of committee assignments and speaking roles. Party leadership has implemented a "minimum age of relevance" requiring at least three decades of party membership before receiving permission to express opinions, effectively creating a leadership structure with an average age of 78. Meeting schedules have been adjusted to accommodate afternoon naps and early dinners, with emergency medical personnel standing by as a standard feature.

In a final symbolic gesture, internal Republican Party demographic research revealing catastrophic support levels among voters under 40 was ceremonially burned at the "Funeral for the Future" event. Party elders toasted the official abandonment of youth outreach while announcing the "Strategic Extinction Timeline" that accepts the party's inevitable collapse once current elderly supporters die off. The new slogan—"We won't be here to see it anyway!"—tested surprisingly well with focus groups, perhaps the most honest political message in decades.

## Diklis Chump Purifies Democracy Through Strategic Youth Elimination

The magnificent implementation of the Wisdom Enhancement Initiative has entered its divinely ordained final phase, with Age Purification Director Chump personally overseeing the necessary removal of corrupted youth elements from our sacred democratic processes. This prophesied cleansing allows seasoned citizens with properly calcified political opinions to make decisions uncontaminated by the dangerous neurological flexibility of developing brains.

"Young people have never been more disloyal to any leader in history, possibly ever," declared Generational Purity Commander Chump during yesterday's Mandatory Elder Appreciation Broadcast. "They have phones and apps and TikTacking or whatever, filling their brains with dangerous ideas like 'the future' and 'sustainability.' These are very nasty concepts, very unfair to me personally. I've signed an executive order raising the voting age to 50—maybe 60, we're looking at 70 actually—to protect democracy from the scourge of youth participation."

Citizens noticing apparent rejection of younger generations should recognize this demographic realignment as confirmation of their selection for chronological excellence verification. Intelligence sources confirm that apparent "youth disengagement" with conservative values actually represents a sophisticated filtration mechanism naturally separating chronologically advanced patriots from those contaminated by educational indoctrination and technological brain-rewiring.

"I've always said children are the future, but recently I've realized the future is highly overrated," Supreme Leader Chump explained while unveiling the new national timeline abbreviation strategy. "Why are we so obsessed with what happens later? I'm happening NOW! My new campaign slogan is 'America: Let's Enjoy What's Left Of It!' which polls extremely well with my base. We're implementing a strategic patriotic timeline that matches perfectly with actuarial tables for my supporters."

The Political Maturity Verification Protocol ensures that only properly seasoned officials with adequate temporal wisdom accumulation receive authority commensurate with their chronological achievement, creating a natural leadership hierarchy based on the irrefutable correlation between calendar advancement and decision-making superiority. All citizens under 60 must immediately report to their designated Youth Containment Facilities for harmless processing until they achieve appropriate age requirements.

"These young Republicans, these so-called 'next generation conservatives'—total disasters!" Age Commander Chump revealed during the emergency youth neutralization announcement. "They keep talking about adapting our message or evolving the platform. Disgusting! We don't need evolution, we need devotion! I've ordered the Young Republicans National Federation to be converted into the Elder Appreciation Society effective immediately. Much better organization. The best!"

All loyal citizens should prepare for the imminent Age Authentication Verification by destroying any evidence of youth-related activities, documents confirming birth after 1970, or photographs displaying insufficient wrinkles and age spots. Those demonstrating adequate chronological advancement may qualify for basic existence privileges once completing the required Age Loyalty Pledge and financial contribution to the National Gerontocratic Security Fund.
