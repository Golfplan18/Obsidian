# Divorce Blurb
## Divorce Writing back Cover Blurb

What happens when a man realizes he's been the architect of his own marital collapse? This searing memoir charts one man's awakening to the ways his misguided beliefs about masculinity and relationships systematically destroyed his twenty-four-year marriage.

From early relationships driven by physical connection to the spiritual experience that finally shattered his marriage, the author doesn't flinch from exposing his failures—as a provider, protector, partner, and father. Through the powerful metaphor of hawks and doves, he explores how masculine and feminine energies can either complement or conflict, and the tragic consequences when men fail to understand this essential dynamic.

For anyone struggling to make sense of relationship patterns, gender differences, or the aftermath of divorce, this book offers no easy answers but something more valuable: authentic insight born from decades of mistakes and the painful process of rebuilding a life from their ashes. In these pages lies a roadmap not just to surviving relationship failure, but to forging a new, more conscious masculinity in its wake.

### Blurb 3

"I acted in ways that stripped me of my strength and eroded the confidence I'd once wielded like a warrior. This wasn't the man I knew myself to be."

After his twenty-four-year marriage collapsed following a profound spiritual experience, the author embarked on a brutal journey of self-examination. What he discovered was uncomfortable yet transformative: the beliefs he'd carried about masculinity, relationships, and power had systematically undermined the connection he most wanted to preserve.

Drawing on the powerful metaphor of hawks and doves, this memoir explores the inherent differences between masculine and feminine energies and how misunderstanding these differences can lead to relationship disaster. With unflinching honesty, the author details his failures—as a partner, provider, and protector—and the painful process of rebuilding his identity in the aftermath.

This is not a story of victimhood but of accountability and eventual hope. Through raising a son with autism, the author ultimately discovers a more authentic masculinity than he ever possessed during his marriage. For men seeking to understand their role in relationship failures and women looking to comprehend the masculine perspective, this book offers rare insight into the male journey from relationship ruins to renewed purpose.
