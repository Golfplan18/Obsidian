The following is Amazon's requirements as of early 2025

## Files Required for Upload

- The cover must be saved in 3 versions:
	- Kindle, which includes only the front cover
	- Softcover, which includes front and back
	- Hardcover, slightly larger than the softcover

## Follow up
- The cover creator in KDP is predictably bad. I need a process to generate my own covers.
- Review front and back matter to determine if adding it helps anything. Too much of it is simply reflex or convention and not required.
- Review marketing options and determine proper actions.

## Cover Design
- Obtain specifications and templates based on book size from Amazon. Must be done fresh for each project.
- Review best-selling covers on Amazon for the genre. 
- Download several designs and identify key characteristics for the genre.
- Develop a style that can be described to midjourney or DALL-E specific to the genre and appropriate to the work.

## Front and Back Matter
- Keep it simple and avoid what isn't needed. Don't waste a reader's time.

## Marketing
- Each work must have ongoing marketing the reinvests a percentage of the sales revenue generated.
- Focus on growing a readership rather than profits
