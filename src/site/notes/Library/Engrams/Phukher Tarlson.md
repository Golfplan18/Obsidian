# Phukher Tarlson Reboot
Since Trump won, I can celebrate his victories and lampoon his views
	Without Trump in office, his writing fell flat
	He is a good sidekick, but not a good lead
Phukher Tarlson gets appointed an informal press secretary in a back-room deal
All his posts celebrate and extend upon the awfulness of what does and might happen.
He is all-in on cynicism and sycophancy 
He introduces ideas and criticisms as something to be celebrated without apparent irony but full of absurdity
His name is too controversial for a published pen name. He is a supporting character to [[Process/Malcolm Little King\|Malcolm Little King]].

## Tasks
- [ ] Update About Me page to reflect reboot
- [ ] Figure out what to do with the Aristocrat Manifesto, probably publish under [[Process/Malcolm Little King\|Malcolm Little King]].
- [x] Review substack drafts to see if I should continue ✅ 2025-02-26
## Existing Substack
https://substack.com/@phukher

## [[Process/Diklis Chump\|Diklis Chump]] Themes
Blog posts typically start with "Diklis Chump" followed by a verb, perhaps announces, says, or whatever action he takes. 
The repetition of Diklis Chump is important.

## Problem Solving
### Do I Restore His Website?
It's a lot of work, and his substack may be enough. 
I can still capture his writing for books without his own website. 
I can post his work as a contributor on the Malcolm Little King website
His Bio can appear as an author on Big Black Cock Publishing Website along with Malcolm Little King
