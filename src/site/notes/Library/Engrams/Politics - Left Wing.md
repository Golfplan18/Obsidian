## America Lost
America has been taken over by the political right and we've been led astray since 1980.
	Nixon, Bretton Woods, abandoning the gold standard
	Ronald Reagan and the Reagan Revolution
	Supply-side economics
	Creation of an American Aristocracy
	Robert Bork and monopoly
	Clarance Thomas
	Greed is Good - Gordon Gecko
	The invisible hand of the market

## The Impotence of Democrats and the Political Left
Carter and Mondale versus Ronald Reagan
	Importance of balanced budget
		Democrats felt we needed to raise taxes to pay for things
		Republicans realized there was a free lunch that they could eat
	Modern Monetary Theory
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_monetary_theory
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartalism
	Democrats became weak and timid
		Each time Democrats passed legislation, they lost in the following election cycle
		Democratic politicians lost faith in Deliverism or Performance Legitimacy
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_%28political%29
		Democrats do not have Fox News to provide support
	Republicans are bolstered by Fox News
		Republican politicians historically struggle with unpopular votes
			Republican support is based on groups with unpopular policies seeking mutual support
			Republican's generally pass legislation that favors one group over another 
			Republican's pass legislation that is deeply unpopular
		Republican politicians used to pay a political price for their unpopular votes
			Fox News exists to prevent Republican politicians from losing elections for instituting their unpopular policies
			Democrats and the political left have no answer for Fox News other than lamenting and complaining
	Democrats stopped speaking about moral issues in the 1970s
		Jimmy Carter was a minister and a deeply religious man
		Jimmy Carter lost reelection, and one reason identified was his preachy manner
		The political left finds most religious ideals repugnant, particularly fundamentalists
		Embracing multiculturalism became the religion of the left, and religious people turned to Republicans
		The political left still fails to speak on morality, ethics, or religion.

## The Political Left Needs Voices of Morality and Resistance
There is no chance for improvement with current circumstances.
The political left is impotent, completely defeated, and no Phoenix is set to rise from the ashes.
The political left doesn't even recognize their problem, nor has any of the Intelligentsia provided any level of guidance. 

## Why Now?
- The political left has collapsed in the United States.
- People need a voice to guide them from the wilderness.
- The voice needs to be militant, unrepentant, mirroring the political right.
- Malcolm X has a history and is a known commodity.
- He's dead, and he can't sue me for impersonating him as a parody.
- Mal-x.com is available. Mal-X is akin to Jay-Z catchy name.
- Modern AI avatars can reanimate Malcolm X.
