# Word Templates for Books
- Simple is best.
- Less is more.
- All sections are contained in a single word document rather than assembled. Inseparable, complete, easy to change in an updated template.
- I only use Word for this purpose, so it can be my Normal Template.
### Sections
Each book has three sections defined by section breaks in Microsoft Word.
	Front Matter
	Body Text
	Back Matter
The section breaks in Word allow unique headers, footers, and page numbering
I have no footers in the entire document
#### Front Matter
##### Settings
Different first page
Different even and odd pages
No header of title page
Page numbers in upper case roman numerals as these are made upper case by the table of contents style
Headings are separate so the Table of Contents doesn't use them.
##### Potential Pages
Praise Pages - Two pages with blurbs from AIs or real people if I can get some. Claude, Gemini, Chat GPT. Query each for 100-150 words with an emotional hook for readers.
Title Page - Title, Subtitle, Author. 
[[Library/Engrams/Copyright page\|Copyright page]]
	Put the Cypress Tree logo above the copyright section and make it the most prominent feature on the page as an advertisement for the publisher.
Table of Contents - The table has a different heading that isn't picked up the TOC
	Ensure all headings make sense for Table of Contents
	Consistent descriptive Heading titles are part of the book's theme.

Kindle Book cover - Embed the 6x9 cover as an image page immediate before beginning the text
No dedications or wasted pages.
#### Body Text
Text - Starts with Heading 1 in the book outline. Continues to end.
Page numbers begin at 1 and continue to the end of the body text
Styles can vary by pen name.
#### Back Matter

Provide little or no back matter in a Kindle. Hurts read through rates.
Limit the back matter in printed books to keep the cost down.

Citations
Appendices
	Only provide what is essential to explain the work
	Rather than provide supplemental appendices, create separate printed work with the information unless it's information by others.
##### Settings
Continue page numbers from main body text.
Use only Heading 1 to appear in TOC. Use Back Matter Heading for any other headings.
### Book Covers
Each cover requires obtaining a new template from Amazon.com unless the book length is similar to one already in the archive.

Covers for hardcover are larger than the cover for a softcover.
Amazon allows 600 dpi for great image clarity.

#### Front Cover
Front cover contains imagery to represent the book and entice readers.
The front cover contains the same three elements as the inside cover page:
- Title
- Subtitle
- Author
#### Back Cover
The back cover has three items:
- Text from [[Library/Engrams/Why Read Page\|Why Read Page]]
- Author photo - (requires photorealistic images of pen names)
- bar code generated from ISBN
