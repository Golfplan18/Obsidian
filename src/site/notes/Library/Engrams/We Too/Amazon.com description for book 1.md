# Amazon.com Description for Book 1
# WeToo: The Moral Case Against Aristocratic Power

Ever wonder why your wages don't match your soaring productivity? Why your town's "economic development" leaves everyone poorer except distant shareholders? Why the "job creators" keep demanding tax cuts while shipping jobs overseas? America doesn't have an economic system—it has an extraction system, and this book finally reveals how it works.

_WeToo_ pulls back the curtain on America's economic aristocracy—not with dry academic jargon, but with the sardonic clarity of a working person who's finally had enough. Forget the tired old debates about "capitalism vs. socialism." This incisive analysis transcends those labels to expose the machinery of everyday exploitation hiding in plain sight.

From the strategic miscategorization of economic critique as "extremism" to the brilliant theater of voter suppression disguised as "election security," this book methodically dismantles the language games that keep Americans voting against their economic interests. With razor-sharp wit, it reveals how both political parties serve the same economic masters while engineering culture wars to prevent us from noticing.

You'll discover:

- Why reading Marx without the propaganda filter terrifies the wealthy
- How the productivity-wage gap represents the greatest heist in economic history
- Why "freedom" rhetoric so consistently delivers outcomes that restrict your actual choices
- The brilliant marketing of lottery thinking as economic policy
- How meritocracy myths convince the exploited to identify with their exploiters
- Why conservative communities celebrate the very businesses that extract their wealth

_WeToo_ doesn't just diagnose the disease—it prescribes the cure. Explore pragmatic progressive solutions like Modern Monetary Theory, velocity-focused economics, and the strategic Four Horsemen approach to wealth redistribution that could actually deliver freedom and prosperity to the many instead of the few.

This isn't just another political book—it's an awakening, a call to arms, and a practical guide to reclaiming democracy from an entrenched aristocracy. It reveals the inherent contradictions in conservative power, from the masculine identity crisis of economic submission to the theological impossibility of reconciling Christ's teachings with predatory capitalism.

Neither conservatives nor progressives are spared critique—the book fearlessly dissects progressive language policing that prevents coalition-building and offers strategic alternatives to defensive liberal crouch politics. It provides a roadmap for rebuilding cross-demographic coalitions around shared economic interests.

Unafraid to venture beyond analysis into strategy, _WeToo_ reveals how creative cultural infiltration and open-source organizing principles can build unstoppable momentum for change. It's a blueprint for building a movement that can actually break through the procedural barriers that prevent popular will from becoming policy.

If you've ever suspected the economic deck is stacked but couldn't quite explain how, this book will arm you with understanding and purpose. The architects of extraction would prefer you never read these pages—which might be the best reason to start reading now.
