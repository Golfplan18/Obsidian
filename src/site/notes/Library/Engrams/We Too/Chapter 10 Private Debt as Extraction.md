# Private Debt as Extraction

Picture this: You're at a conservative rally where someone is shouting through a megaphone that "taxation is theft!" The crowd roars in agreement. Meanwhile, that same crowd collectively owes $1.77 trillion in student loans, pays mortgage interest that will double the price of their homes, and is one medical emergency away from bankruptcy. Half of them are carrying credit cards with interest rates that would make a loan shark blush.

Welcome to America, where public taxes that build roads and schools are tyranny, but a 29% interest rate on the credit card you need to buy groceries during tough times is just "the market at work." We haven't eliminated taxation – we've just privatized it. What once flowed through public channels now flows directly from your pocket to Wall Street, with none of that messy democratic accountability getting in the way. The middleman has been cut out – and that middleman was you.

## The Great Sleight of Hand

The libertarian fantasy of a tax-free utopia has been achieved – if by "tax-free" you mean "taxed by corporations instead of governments." It's a brilliant magic trick, really. Look over here at the evil government taking your money! Meanwhile, don't pay attention to the credit card company quietly extracting three times more from your paycheck through interest rates that would have gotten people thrown in prison for usury just a few generations ago.

The rhetoric is masterful in its deception. Government taking a percentage of your income to build infrastructure, fund schools, and provide healthcare? Literal theft. Bank charging you 24.99% interest on a credit card you need because your wages haven't kept up with inflation? That's just good old American capitalism, friend.

This isn't freedom from taxation – it's the privatization of taxation without the pesky inconvenience of your vote mattering. At least with public taxation, you theoretically get a say in how the money is spent. When was the last time Citibank or Sallie Mae sent you a ballot to vote on their corporate policies? The extraction of your wealth continues unabated; only now it flows directly to shareholders rather than public services.

## The Debt Extraction Machine

Every month, millions of Americans sit at kitchen tables trying to figure out which bills to pay first. That student loan payment, mortgage check, credit card minimum, or medical bill on the installment plan all represent the same thing: money moving from those who work for a living to those who own for a living.

Debt isn't just a financial arrangement – it's a wealth transfer mechanism. Think about it: When was the last time you voted on your interest rate? When did Wells Fargo or Sallie Mae ask for your input on their policies? Your mortgage lender doesn't worry about being voted out of office if they squeeze you too hard.

As anthropologist David Graeber put it, debt is essentially "a promise corrupted by both math and violence." The math ensures you always pay back more than you borrowed. The violence – in the form of ruined credit scores, wage garnishment, and the entire apparatus of state power – ensures you can't escape the obligation.

Over the past several decades, the things your parents' generation paid for through taxes – college education, affordable housing, even many aspects of healthcare – you now finance through personal debt. This shift from public funding to private financing wasn't an accident. It was by design.

When something is funded through taxation, costs can be distributed progressively, with the wealthy paying a larger share. When it's shifted to private financing through debt, the costs fall heaviest on those who can least afford them, while the profits flow to those who need them least.

## Private Equity: The Rentier's Attack Dogs

If debt is the weapon of choice for wealth extraction, private equity firms are the elite mercenaries who wield it with surgical precision. These financial predators have perfected a business model so cynical it makes traditional robbery look positively quaint by comparison.

Here's how the magic trick works: First, gather money from wealthy investors who have more cash than they know what to do with. Then use that money to buy up functioning, often profitable businesses. But here's the twist – make the businesses themselves take on the debt you used to purchase them. It's like forcing someone to take out a loan to pay their own ransom.

Once the business is saddled with this crushing debt, start "extracting value" – which is private equity speak for slashing jobs, gutting benefits, selling off assets, and generally sucking every penny possible from the operation while paying yourself massive "management fees" regardless of performance. When the business eventually collapses under the weight of this financial vampirism, simply walk away, secure in the knowledge that you've already extracted your profits.

Toys "R" Us? Loaded with $5 billion in debt from its leveraged buyout before collapsing and putting 33,000 people out of work. Your local newspaper that used to have actual reporters? Probably hollowed out by Alden Global Capital or some other private equity vulture. Even nursing homes and hospitals aren't safe – studies show higher mortality rates after private equity takeovers, but hey, shareholder value was maximized!

And the cherry on top? Private equity barons pay lower tax rates than their secretaries thanks to the carried interest loophole, a tax dodge with roots in 16th-century shipping that allows them to classify what is obviously compensation as investment income. Modern-day pirates sailing the financial seas, plundering businesses while paying lower tax rates than the nurses caring for their elderly victims.

The process creates monopolies by design – private equity firms pass the same companies back and forth between them, consolidating industries until competition is eliminated and prices can be raised at will. It's not capitalism; it's organized extraction under the veneer of investment.

## Higher Education as Perfected Exploitation

Meet Jessica. She's 22, just graduated from a state university, and now has $37,000 in student loan debt. Her parents didn't go to college, but they did factory work that paid enough to own a home. Those jobs are gone now, and Jessica was told her entire life that college was the only path to security.

Now she sends $400 a month to loan servicers – money that isn't going toward a home, savings, or starting a business. She'll be doing this for the next 10-20 years. This isn't just her story – it's the story of 45 million Americans.

If you were designing the perfect wealth extraction machine, you couldn't do much better than the American higher education system. First, make a college degree an artificial necessity – a basic requirement for jobs that didn't require degrees a generation ago. Then systematically defund public universities, forcing them to raise tuition to survive. Finally, create a predatory lending system that allows 18-year-olds with no income to take on massive, non-dischargeable debt.

It's a brilliant system, really. Young people have no choice but to take on debt if they want economic stability. And thanks to the peculiar bankruptcy laws surrounding student loans – laws lobbied for by the same industry profiting from them – there's virtually no escape.

For Black students, the debt burden is even worse – closer to $53,000 on average. This isn't just a financial burden; it's a racial wealth gap amplifier. While a young person from a wealthy family graduates debt-free and immediately begins building wealth, a young person from a working-class family graduates with the equivalent of a mortgage but no house, transferring a portion of every paycheck to loan servicers for decades.

## The Necessities Repackaged as Profit Centers

Remember when housing was primarily about having a place to live? Your grandparents likely purchased a home that cost about twice their annual income. Today, the average home costs about six times the average annual income. This isn't because houses are three times better – it's because housing has been transformed from shelter into an investment vehicle and wealth extraction opportunity.

That 30-year mortgage – once a tool for making homeownership accessible – has become a lifetime debt sentence that ensures a third to half of your income flows directly to financial institutions. By the time you've paid it off, you'll have paid for your house twice over thanks to interest. And if you're renting, you're still paying someone else's mortgage, just without building any equity for yourself.

Then there's healthcare – perhaps the most obscene example of debt-based extraction. Imagine this: Your child gets sick with a high fever in the middle of the night. You rush to the emergency room, they get treatment, and two weeks later, a bill arrives for $2,500. Your insurance covered some, but not all. Now you're faced with putting this on a credit card or negotiating a payment plan with the hospital.

Only in America do people go bankrupt because they got sick or injured. Only in America is medical debt the leading cause of personal bankruptcy. Only in America do people avoid ambulances because they can't afford them.

When a hospital charges $50 for a pill that costs 50 cents, the extra $49.50 isn't going to research or better care – it's going to executive compensation and shareholder returns. Your illness has become someone else's profit center.

Even everyday consumption has been weaponized through consumer debt. As wages have stagnated relative to productivity for four decades, credit cards have become a necessity for millions just to make ends meet. The average American household carries about $6,000 in credit card debt, often at interest rates that would make a medieval usurer blush.

Education, housing, healthcare, basic consumption – all necessities transformed into wealth extraction opportunities. They ensure that a significant portion of every dollar earned by working people is immediately siphoned back to the financial sector through interest payments and fees.

## Debt as Modern Indentured Servitude

Beyond the economic extraction, debt serves another crucial function: control. A population drowning in debt is less likely to organize, strike, or challenge the status quo. When you're one missed paycheck away from defaulting on your loans or mortgage, the threat of job loss becomes terrifying. This precarity isn't a bug in the system – it's a feature.

Think about what debt does to your mind. That constant background anxiety, the persistent sense that you're falling behind even when you're working harder than ever. The shame, stress, and nagging feeling of personal failure, even though the system is explicitly designed to keep you indebted.

This psychological toll isn't just collateral damage – it's part of how debt functions as a control mechanism. People overwhelmed by financial anxiety don't have the mental bandwidth to engage politically. They're too busy working second jobs or side hustles to attend community meetings or labor organizing sessions. Too exhausted from working to pay their debts to fight for a system where those debts wouldn't exist.

The term "wage slave" takes on new meaning when you realize how much of your wage goes directly to servicing debt rather than improving your life. For many Americans, freedom is an illusion – they're free to choose which master to serve, but serve they must, because debt ensures they can never truly be economically independent.

## Breaking the Extraction Cycle

Let's be clear: This isn't about bad personal financial choices. No amount of budgeting apps, coupon clipping, or skipped lattes can overcome a system deliberately designed to extract wealth and enforce compliance.

The solution isn't financial literacy classes. Those might help individuals navigate the system marginally better, but they don't change the system itself. The solution is collective action to fundamentally restructure how we finance education, housing, healthcare, and other necessities.

This means fighting for universal public goods funded through progressive taxation rather than private debt. It means demanding student debt cancellation not as a one-time forgiveness but as recognition that the debt itself is illegitimate. It means pushing for universal healthcare that eliminates medical debt entirely. It means creating public housing that isn't subject to market speculation and establishing public banking options that don't extract predatory fees from the most vulnerable.

Most fundamentally, it means recognizing that debt isn't just a financial arrangement – it's a power relationship. And like all power relationships that favor the few over the many, it can be challenged, resisted, and ultimately transformed.

The next time someone complains about taxation being theft, ask them about the interest rate on their credit card. Ask them why medical bills drive Americans to bankruptcy while hospital CEOs make eight-figure salaries. Ask them why their children will pay more for college in a semester than they paid for their entire degree.

Because the real theft isn't taxation – it's the systematic replacement of public goods with private debt, of democratic accountability with financial extraction, of citizenship with perpetual indebtedness.

We've been privatizing taxation for decades. It's time we started publicizing prosperity instead.
