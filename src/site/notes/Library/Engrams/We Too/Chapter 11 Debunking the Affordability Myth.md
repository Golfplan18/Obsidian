# Debunking the Affordability Myth

You're watching the evening news when a politician appears, explaining why universal healthcare just isn't possible. "How will we pay for it?" they ask with a furrowed brow and practiced concern. That same evening, they vote for a $50 billion military budget increase without a second thought. The next morning, your insurance company denies a claim for a procedure your doctor deemed necessary, and you're left wondering how you'll cover the $8,000 bill while the insurance CEO takes home $42 million in compensation.

"How will you pay for it?"

Four simple words. The political equivalent of a conversational killshot, delivered with the practiced precision of someone who has absolutely no interest in hearing your answer. Because the question isn't really a question at all—it's a dismissal wrapped in fiscal responsibility packaging, like a wolf wearing an accountant's glasses.

## The Political Killshot

Sarah works two jobs and still can't afford health insurance. Her son has asthma, and she rations his inhaler because a new one costs $300. When she hears politicians debate healthcare, someone inevitably asks, "How will we pay for universal coverage?" – right before they approve another multi-billion dollar defense contract without asking the same question.

This rhetorical trick isn't just effective; it's selectively applied. When we're bombing another country or cutting taxes for billionaires, the payment question goes mysteriously missing—like a conservative's conscience during a healthcare debate. It's almost as if the question isn't about accounting but about who benefits from the spending.

You've noticed this pattern play out repeatedly. Programs that help ordinary people face impossible financial scrutiny, while corporate subsidies and military spending sail through with minimal questioning. This isn't coincidence or carelessness—it's strategy.

The "how will you pay for it" question works because it transforms political choices into supposed financial impossibilities. It ends debates before they begin by framing beneficial programs as fantasy while treating harmful spending as necessary. It's the political equivalent of telling your kids there's no money for college while buying yourself a yacht.

## The Selective Budget Amnesia Epidemic

Remember 2008? When Wall Street's casino crashed the economy, Congress found $700 billion for bailouts in about 15 minutes. When the Pentagon wants another $50 billion added to its already galactic budget? Approved without serious debate. Tax cuts for the wealthy that will add trillions to the deficit? Well, those magically "pay for themselves" through economic growth that somehow never materializes.

But suggest investing similar amounts in childcare, education, or climate action, and suddenly we transform into penny-pinching accountants obsessed with spreadsheets and grave concerns about our grandchildren's financial future.

Take Jason, a factory worker who hasn't seen a real wage increase in a decade. His town's schools are underfunded, and the roads are filled with potholes. When he asks why, officials explain there's simply no money. Yet the same town gave millions in tax breaks to a corporation that promised jobs but delivered part-time positions with no benefits. The money wasn't missing—it was redirected.

This selective budget amnesia isn't accidental—it's carefully cultivated. By treating some expenses as automatically affordable and others as requiring impossible fiscal gymnastics, the political establishment maintains an artificial dividing line between what's "realistic" and what's "fantasy."

When politicians say "we can't afford" universal healthcare, what they're really saying is "we choose not to prioritize universal healthcare." But framing it as an objective financial constraint rather than a subjective value judgment helps avoid accountability for that choice.

## Those Suspiciously Functional Foreign Countries

Mark's cousin in Canada recently had emergency surgery. Total out-of-pocket cost? Zero dollars. No paperwork, no fighting with insurance, no bills arriving for months afterward. Mark, meanwhile, is still paying off an appendectomy from three years ago despite having "good insurance."

Perhaps nothing exposes the affordability myth more effectively than looking beyond our borders. Other developed nations somehow manage to provide universal healthcare, affordable education, comprehensive public transportation, paid family leave, and numerous other "impossibilities" that American politicians insist we can't afford.

Canada provides universal healthcare at roughly half the per capita cost of the U.S. system while achieving better outcomes on most health metrics. The average Canadian doesn't worry about medical bankruptcy or choosing between insulin and food—concepts as foreign to them as universal healthcare apparently is to American policymakers.

Germany, with a GDP per capita lower than the United States, offers tuition-free university education to its citizens and even to international students. Somehow, their economy hasn't collapsed under the weight of investing in their population's skills and knowledge.

Japan maintains a world-class public transportation system that makes America's look like a collection of rusty shopping carts with missing wheels. Yet their economy hasn't imploded from the burden of public investment.

The standard defense against these international comparisons is adorably predictable: "But America is different! We're bigger, more diverse, more special, more American!" These excuses collapse under minimal scrutiny. Our economy's massive size should give us more flexibility, not less. Our diversity is a strength, not an impediment to effective governance. And many of the policies we claim we can't afford—like universal healthcare—would actually cost less than our current dysfunctional systems.

The real difference isn't economic capacity—it's political choice. Other nations have chosen to prioritize the wellbeing of their citizens over the accumulation of wealth by the few. We've made the opposite choice while pretending it was financially inevitable rather than politically determined.

## The Private Sector Premium

Lisa pays $800 a month for family health insurance with a $5,000 deductible. Last year, her daughter needed surgery, and despite being "covered," they still paid over $12,000 out of pocket. Meanwhile, the insurance company reported record profits, and its CEO earned $25 million in compensation. Lisa isn't buying healthcare—she's funding executive bonuses while still paying for most of her care.

When confronted with the success of public systems in other countries, defenders of the status quo inevitably suggest that privatization is the answer—that market forces will create efficiency and lower costs. The empirical evidence tells a different story, one that sounds suspiciously like the world's longest con job.

The American healthcare system stands as the perfect case study. We spend nearly twice as much per capita as the average for developed nations with universal public systems, yet leave millions uninsured or underinsured and produce worse outcomes on most measures. It's like paying for a Lamborghini, receiving a tricycle with a flat tire, and being told you should be grateful for the innovation.

This isn't a bug in privatized essential services—it's a feature. Private companies have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for shareholders, which means extracting as much revenue as possible while providing the minimum service necessary to retain customers. For essential services that people cannot simply opt out of—healthcare, education, housing, transportation—this creates a captive market ripe for exploitation.

What's often missing from the affordability debate is recognition of the private tax we're already paying—one that doesn't appear on any government ledger but certainly empties our wallets. Americans pay a private health insurance tax that dwarfs what citizens of other countries pay in public healthcare taxes. We pay a private education tax in the form of skyrocketing tuition and crushing student debt. We pay a private transportation tax by being forced to own and maintain personal vehicles because of inadequate public transit.

These privatized systems don't reduce costs—they shift them from shared public financing to individual burden, creating a regressive system where those least able to pay often bear the heaviest costs. This isn't just cruel—it's inefficient, creating barriers to access that reduce overall utilization and economic productivity.

## Manufacturing Scarcity in the Land of Abundance

James and Maria both work full-time jobs but struggle to afford their apartment. They've been told repeatedly that housing is expensive because "there's not enough to go around" and "that's just the market." Meanwhile, their city has thousands of vacant luxury units held as investment properties, and developers continue building high-end condos while affordable housing disappears.

The affordability myth isn't just an economic misunderstanding—it's a political tool for maintaining hierarchical power. By convincing ordinary Americans that we can't afford to meet basic needs, elites create an artificial sense of scarcity that justifies the status quo and prevents demands for a more equitable distribution of resources.

Scarcity narratives serve several crucial functions in maintaining the current power structure. First, they naturalize inequality by suggesting that there simply isn't enough to go around, rather than acknowledging that scarcity is often the result of policy choices. When people believe there isn't enough for everyone, they're more likely to focus on protecting their piece of the pie rather than questioning why the pie is so unequally sliced in the first place.

Second, these narratives create competition among those struggling for resources, preventing solidarity that might challenge the system itself. When workers believe that immigrants are taking their jobs, or that racial minorities are getting "special treatment," they're less likely to recognize their common interests with those groups against the economic elite who actually determine their circumstances.

Economic precarity—the constant fear of financial ruin—functions as a powerful tool for preventing resistance. When people are working multiple jobs just to stay afloat, when they're one medical emergency away from bankruptcy, when they're drowning in student or housing debt, they don't have the time, energy, or security to organize for better conditions. The exhaustion and anxiety produced by artificial scarcity are perfect for maintaining the status quo.

Perhaps most insidiously, artificial scarcity enables the redirection of anger toward marginalized scapegoats rather than the actual sources of economic hardship. When people are struggling, it's easier to convince them that immigrants, welfare recipients, or racial minorities are taking what should be theirs than to acknowledge the systematic upward redistribution of wealth orchestrated by those at the top.

## Reclaiming Democratic Choice Over Resources

What would happen if we walked into budget debates with a different question? Instead of "How will we pay for it?" what if we asked, "What kind of society do we want to live in, and how do we allocate resources to create it?"

This shift isn't just rhetorical—it's revolutionary. It acknowledges that budgets aren't technical documents but moral ones. They reflect our values and priorities—what we believe is worth investing in and what we're willing to let people suffer without. By bringing these choices into the democratic arena rather than treating them as technocratic necessities, we can create a politics that genuinely reflects the needs and aspirations of the majority.

We've seen this approach work in local settings. Participatory budgeting processes in cities across the country have shown that when ordinary people get to decide how public money is spent, they prioritize communities and necessities over fancy developments and corporate giveaways. Projects like community centers, neighborhood safety improvements, and public parks rise to the top when people rather than politicians make the decisions.

Building movements with an understanding of our true economic capacity changes everything about political strategy. Instead of fighting over scraps and accepting harmful tradeoffs as inevitable, we can demand what people actually need and deserve. We can reject the false choices presented by the politics of austerity and articulate a vision of shared prosperity that's both morally compelling and economically viable.

This means creating cross-class coalitions around universal programs that benefit the vast majority. It means exposing the hypocrisy of selective budget constraints that only apply to programs benefiting ordinary people. It means building democratic institutions for budget decisions currently made by unaccountable financial elites.

## The Highest Cost of All

When Robert couldn't afford insulin, he started rationing it, taking less than his prescribed dose. Three months later, he was dead from diabetic ketoacidosis—a completely preventable condition with proper medication. His death wasn't just a personal tragedy; it represented an enormous cost to society—lost productivity, emergency services, and most importantly, a human life with immeasurable potential.

The truth is, the most expensive thing we're buying right now is inequality itself. The cost of maintaining a system that generates such extreme disparities—in healthcare outcomes, educational opportunities, housing security, and countless other metrics—far exceeds the cost of creating a more equitable society.

We're paying for our current choices with lost productivity, preventable suffering, environmental degradation, and social instability. Studies show that societies with greater inequality have higher rates of mental illness, drug abuse, violence, incarceration, and lower life expectancy—problems that affect everyone, not just those at the bottom.

Consider healthcare. By refusing to implement a universal system, we pay more, get less, and watch people die from treatable conditions. We waste enormous resources on billing, insurance administration, and denial management that could be directed toward actual care. Then we absorb further costs when people without access to preventive care end up in emergency rooms with advanced conditions that are more expensive to treat.

Or education. By making higher education unaffordable without debt, we hamstring an entire generation's economic potential, delaying home purchases, family formation, and entrepreneurship. The lost productivity and innovation from people unable to pursue their talents and interests because of financial barriers represents an incalculable cost to society.

The next time someone asks "how will you pay for it?" regarding a program that would help millions of ordinary Americans, the answer isn't a detailed budget proposal. The answer is: "How do we pay for endless wars, corporate subsidies, and tax cuts for the wealthy? The same way. The question isn't whether we can afford to meet human needs—it's whether we can afford not to."

Because ultimately, the question isn't what we can afford—it's what kind of society we choose to create. And the affordability myth has constrained our imagination and limited our humanity for too long. It's time to reject artificial scarcity and embrace the abundant possibilities of democratic choice.
