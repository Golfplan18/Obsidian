# The Four Horsemen Strategy

That moment when your boss congratulates the team on a "record-breaking year" right before announcing a wage freeze "due to economic uncertainties." Meanwhile, the CEO's compensation package quietly doubled, and shareholders just received their largest dividend in company history. Sound familiar?

Or perhaps you've experienced the joy of watching your student loan balance somehow grow despite years of payments, all while the loan servicer's parent company builds a shiny new headquarters. Maybe you've felt that special panic when rent increases 15% but your paycheck stays frozen for the third year running.

These aren't just annoying life experiences. They're features of a system designed to extract wealth from those who work for their money and funnel it to those who already have plenty.

## The Real Conservative Nightmare

Ask wealthy people what keeps them up at night, and they'll rattle off the usual bogeymen—socialism, regulations, taxes. But dig a little deeper, past the Fox News talking points, and you'll discover their actual nightmare: the slow erosion of their stored wealth. Not dramatic confiscation—just the quiet, persistent drip of value leaking from their fortunes day after day, year after year.

Frank, a hedge fund manager I interviewed for this book, put it bluntly after a few drinks: "We can handle almost anything except losing purchasing power. Higher taxes? We hire better accountants. Regulations? We lobby to modify them or find loopholes. But when our wealth just...melts away? That's terrifying."

What Frank didn't say, but implied, was that the current system works beautifully for people like him. While politicians debate endlessly about marginal tax rates and loopholes, the real mechanisms that transfer wealth upward operate quietly in the background, rarely discussed and even more rarely challenged.

If we wanted to actually dismantle the machinery of wealth concentration—not just complain about it or tinker around its edges—what specific policies would strike at its foundation? Not a laundry list of progressive wishes, but precision instruments designed to disrupt the core mechanisms of exploitation.

Enter the Four Horsemen of the Conservative Apocalypse: four interlocking policies that together accomplish what progressive taxation alone never could—the systematic dismantling of concentrated wealth and power. Each targets a critical pillar supporting the current system of extraction.

## First Horseman: Mandatory Cost of Living Adjustments

Maria has worked at the same grocery store for eight years. Her starting wage was $10 an hour in 2015. After several "generous" raises, she now makes $12.50. But a gallon of milk that cost $3.50 when she started now costs $5.25. Her rent has increased from $800 to $1,200. Maria isn't just running in place—she's falling behind while working just as hard.

This isn't a bug in the system—it's a feature. The gradual erosion of purchasing power for workers ensures that labor becomes cheaper over time in real terms while the value of stored wealth remains protected. It's a silent tax that falls exclusively on people who work for a living.

Mandatory Cost of Living Adjustments would change this equation fundamentally. Imagine if all wages—not just those of unionized workers or government employees—automatically increased with inflation. No more congressional battles over raising the minimum wage every decade. No more workers falling behind while waiting for politicians to act. Just an automatic adjustment ensuring that what you earn today will buy the same amount tomorrow.

When workers maintain their purchasing power, money moves through the economy rather than pooling in the accounts of the wealthy. People buy goods and services, creating demand that benefits everyone—except those whose business model depends on an increasingly desperate workforce.

The policy mechanics are straightforward: tie wages to a reliable measure of living costs, and require regular adjustments—monthly, quarterly, or annually—to maintain purchasing power. This could be implemented at federal, state, or even city levels.

Of course, business owners will cry poverty. "We can't afford it!" they'll wail, conveniently omitting that if their business model requires paying wages that steadily lose value, perhaps their business shouldn't exist. A restaurant that can only operate by slowly poisoning customers would rightly be shut down. Why do we accept businesses that can only operate by slowly impoverishing workers?

What the wealthy truly fear about mandatory COLAs isn't increased costs—it's the end of one of their most effective wealth extraction tools: inflation that eats away at worker wages while leaving asset values untouched or even enhanced. When your income comes from owning things—property, stocks, bonds—inflation often helps you. When your income comes from working, inflation without corresponding wage increases steadily erodes your position.

Mandatory COLAs would end this quiet wealth transfer from workers to owners. No wonder they fight it so fiercely.

## Second Horseman: Universal Basic Income

"Get a job!" The rallying cry of conservatives everywhere when confronted with poverty. The assumption behind this command is clear: employment should be the sole legitimate source of survival, and anyone who can't or won't participate in the labor market deserves whatever misery follows.

James experienced this firsthand when his factory closed and moved operations to Mexico. At 52, with specialized skills in an industry that no longer existed locally, he struggled to find comparable work. The temporary assistance he received came with endless requirements, meetings, and threats of cutoffs. The message was clear: your worth as a human being depends entirely on your employment status.

This arrangement serves a crucial function for employers: it ensures a desperate workforce willing to accept whatever terms are offered. It's hard to negotiate for better wages when homelessness is the alternative. The threat of destitution is the ultimate tool for maintaining worker compliance.

Universal Basic Income demolishes this coercive dynamic. By providing everyone with an unconditional payment sufficient to meet basic needs, UBI removes the threat of destitution from the employment equation. Suddenly, workers can say "no" to exploitative conditions. They can walk away from abusive bosses. They can take risks to start businesses or pursue education. They can care for family members without falling into poverty.

This liberation from coercive labor practices is precisely why the wealthy find UBI so threatening. Their power rests significantly on the economic desperation of others. When that desperation disappears, so does much of their leverage.

Implementation approaches vary, from a full basic income covering all essential needs to a smaller payment that provides a foundation while still requiring supplemental income for most people. The funding could come from progressive taxation, carbon taxes, financial transaction taxes, or even returns from publicly owned assets like land or natural resources.

The economic effects would be substantial. Unlike money given to the wealthy, which often sits idle in investment accounts, every dollar of a basic income would immediately circulate through the economy as recipients purchase necessities. This creates a powerful multiplier effect, generating increased economic activity that benefits even those who aren't direct UBI recipients.

Critics love to pretend that UBI would lead to mass idleness—as if the only thing preventing people from contributing to society is the threat of starvation. This reveals more about the critics than about UBI itself. It assumes people work solely to avoid punishment rather than to express creativity, gain satisfaction, build community, or improve their circumstances.

What UBI actually threatens is not productive work but exploitative labor—the kind that only exists because people have no choice but to accept it. Is it surprising that those who benefit from such exploitation oppose giving people choices?

## Third Horseman: Free Education For All

Elena graduated with $87,000 in student loan debt from a state university. Her starting salary as a teacher barely covered rent, food, and her loan payments. Ten years later, despite never missing a payment, she owes $82,000. Her debt has shaped every decision of her adult life—where she lives, whether she could afford children, even who she married. When she considered leaving teaching for better pay, she discovered her debt made returning to school for retraining financially impossible.

Student debt in America has become modern indentured servitude. Trap young people in non-dischargeable debt before they're old enough to legally buy a beer, then watch as that debt shapes their career choices, living arrangements, relationship decisions, and political views for decades to come. It's almost beautiful in its cruelty—a mechanism that simultaneously extracts wealth from the young while ensuring their compliance with a system designed to exploit them.

Free education at all levels—from early childhood through college and vocational training—would dismantle this mechanism of control entirely. No more graduates starting their adult lives underwater. No more low-income students forced to choose between debt and opportunity. No more mid-career workers trapped in dying industries because they can't afford retraining.

Eliminating debt as a control mechanism would transform more than just individual lives—it would reshape the entire economic landscape. When people choose careers based on passion and purpose rather than loan repayment prospects, we get better teachers, social workers, artists, and public servants. When entrepreneurs can take risks without worrying about student loan payments, we get more innovation. When workers can retrain without going into debt, we get a more adaptable workforce.

Implementation could be gradual—starting with community colleges and public universities, then expanding to include private institutions that meet certain criteria. Technical and vocational education would be included alongside traditional academic pathways, recognizing the diverse needs of both students and the economy.

The economic benefits would far outweigh the costs. A more educated workforce means higher productivity, greater innovation, improved public health, reduced crime, and stronger democratic participation. The additional tax revenue generated by these improvements would largely offset the initial investment.

But free education threatens more than just the profits of loan servicers and for-profit colleges. It threatens the stratification system that sorts Americans into winners and losers based on accident of birth. It threatens the leverage that employers hold over debt-burdened workers. Most fundamentally, it threatens the narrative that opportunity must be rationed rather than guaranteed.

An educated population that isn't shackled by debt is dangerous to those who benefit from the status quo. They might start asking uncomfortable questions about why things are the way they are. They might demand change. No wonder the wealthy seem so invested in keeping education expensive and debt-financed.

## Fourth Horseman: Targeted Inflation via Federal Reserve Policy

Robert watched his retirement savings lose 20% of its purchasing power over the last decade despite being in "safe" investments. Meanwhile, his mortgage payment stayed the same, effectively becoming cheaper each year as inflation reduced its real cost. The experience taught him something economists rarely discuss: inflation affects different types of wealth very differently.

For decades, the Federal Reserve has treated inflation as an absolute evil to be suppressed at all costs, even if that meant creating recessions and throwing millions out of work. The dirty secret behind this obsession with price stability is that inflation primarily threatens those who hold substantial wealth, particularly in cash, bonds, and fixed-income investments. For working people who own few assets beyond their labor power, moderate inflation accompanied by rising wages is often beneficial—it reduces the real value of their debts while maintaining their purchasing power.

Targeted inflation through Federal Reserve policy would flip this script. Rather than aiming for the current target of around 2% inflation, the Fed could target 4-5% inflation while implementing policies to ensure wages keep pace (through the mandatory COLAs discussed earlier). This would gradually but inexorably erode the value of static wealth—the hoarded fortunes sitting in investment accounts—while protecting workers through rising wages.

Think of it as a wealth tax that requires no IRS agents, no complex reporting, and no clever evasion strategies by the wealthy. It simply happens automatically, day by day, as the purchasing power of idle wealth diminishes while working people stay protected.

Implementation would require changing how the Federal Reserve operates. Instead of focusing solely on controlling inflation and maintaining employment, the Fed would explicitly aim to reduce wealth inequality while maintaining economic stability. This might include creating money that goes directly to ordinary households rather than flowing through financial institutions, targeting higher inflation alongside strong wage growth, and ensuring monetary policy benefits reach everyday people rather than just asset-holders.

The wealthy understand this threat intimately. It's why they oppose even modest inflation so vigorously. It's why they push for "independent" central banks dominated by financial interests. It's why they created an entire economic mythology around the evils of inflation while downplaying the harms of unemployment and wage stagnation. They recognize that targeted inflation, properly managed, would gradually dilute their economic power without requiring explicit confiscation of their assets.

Protecting workers while eroding static wealth is precisely what makes this approach so threatening to the status quo. It doesn't attack the wealthy directly—it simply changes the rules so that hoarding wealth becomes less profitable than deploying it productively. Over time, this shift would dramatically reduce wealth concentration without requiring pitched political battles over tax rates or regulations.

## The Symphony of Wealth Redistribution

Each of these policies is powerful on its own. Together, they create a symphony of wealth redistribution that works automatically and continuously rather than through occasional political interventions.

Mandatory COLAs ensure that workers maintain their purchasing power regardless of inflation.

Universal Basic Income removes the coercive aspect of employment and ensures everyone can meet their basic needs.

Free Education eliminates debt as a control mechanism and creates genuine opportunity for all.

Targeted Inflation gradually erodes stored wealth while workers remain protected.

The beauty of this approach is that it addresses root causes. Rather than treating symptoms of inequality through redistributive taxation after wealth has already concentrated, these policies prevent the concentration from occurring in the first place. They alter the fundamental dynamics of capitalism without requiring its immediate overthrow.

Think of it like preventing heart disease instead of performing emergency bypass surgery. We can continue trying to tax wealth after it has accumulated in vast fortunes—a politically difficult approach that the wealthy have countless strategies to evade. Or we can implement systems that prevent that unhealthy accumulation in the first place by ensuring worker purchasing power, removing economic coercion, eliminating debt-based control, and slowly deflating existing wealth stockpiles.

Together, these four policies represent the minimum necessary disruption to meaningfully shift power from capital to labor, from the wealthy to everyone else. They create favorable conditions for further progressive changes by building economic security and breaking the mechanisms of control that currently suppress political organization among working people.

## When They Scream "Socialism"

You'll know you've hit a nerve when these proposals trigger hysterical reactions from the wealthy and their representatives. The volume and viciousness of the response directly correlates with how effectively a policy threatens their power.

When they scream about mandatory COLAs causing businesses to fail, they're really saying: "Our business model depends on steadily reducing what we pay workers in real terms."

When they howl about UBI destroying the work ethic, they're really saying: "We need people desperate enough to accept whatever working conditions we offer."

When they wail about free education being unaffordable, they're really saying: "An educated, debt-free population might question our right to rule."

When they shriek about inflation being catastrophic, they're really saying: "Our hoarded wealth might lose value, and that's unacceptable even if everyone else benefits."

These reactions reveal the truth: the wealthy aren't afraid these policies will fail economically. They're afraid they'll succeed in redistributing power. The apocalypse these four horsemen bring isn't economic collapse—it's the end of unjustified hierarchy and unearned privilege.

The fundamental choice we face isn't between capitalism and socialism as abstract systems. It's between a society organized to extract maximum wealth for the few versus one designed to create prosperity and security for all. The Four Horsemen Strategy provides a concrete path toward the latter without requiring violent revolution or complete system replacement.

We don't need to overthrow everything at once. We just need to systematically dismantle the machinery of extraction and replace it with systems of circulation and shared prosperity. These four policies would transform our economic landscape more fundamentally than any tax plan or regulatory scheme, shifting power at its source rather than treating symptoms after the damage is done.

And that's exactly why they'll fight them with everything they have.
