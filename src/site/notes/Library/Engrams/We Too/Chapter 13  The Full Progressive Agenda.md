# The Full Progressive Agenda

You're standing in line at the pharmacy, clutching a prescription that your doctor says you absolutely need. The pharmacist types something into their computer, grimaces, and tells you your insurance won't cover it. The cost? $347 for a month's supply. You walk away empty-handed because rent is due next week. Meanwhile, the CEO of your insurance company just announced record profits and bought his third home.

Or maybe you're one of the lucky ones who has "good insurance" through your job. You hate the work, your boss is toxic, but you smile through gritted teeth because your kid has asthma, and changing jobs means risking a gap in coverage. Freedom in America means the freedom to choose which corporation holds your health hostage.

These aren't unfortunate accidents in an otherwise working system. They're features, not bugs. They're how the system is designed to work – extracting maximum profit from human necessity.

## Universal Healthcare

Maria worked as a hotel housekeeper for fifteen years. When she started feeling sharp pains in her abdomen, she ignored them. No insurance, no sick days, and three kids to feed meant doctor visits weren't in the budget. By the time she collapsed at work and was rushed to the ER, her cancer had spread. Now she's gone, leaving behind medical bills that her family will never pay off.

The American healthcare system isn't failing – it's succeeding spectacularly at what it was designed to do: extract maximum wealth from human suffering. We've created a masterpiece of inefficiency where insurance companies employ entire departments dedicated to finding reasons not to pay for your care, hospitals charge $75 for an aspirin with a straight face, and pharmaceutical companies spend more on marketing than research.

This "complexity" isn't some natural phenomenon like weather patterns. It was engineered – deliberately, methodically, expensively – by an industry that profits from confusion. Every incomprehensible bill, every "out-of-network" surprise, every prior authorization requirement exists not because healthcare is inherently complicated, but because complexity creates extraction opportunities.

Meanwhile, Canada somehow manages to provide universal coverage at half our cost. The UK's National Health Service delivers better outcomes across most metrics despite spending a fraction of what we do per capita. Even "free-market" Switzerland requires standardized, non-profit basic insurance for everyone. But we're supposed to believe universal healthcare is as fantastical as unicorns and dragons.

Medicare for All isn't just about compassion – though there's certainly that. It's about liberation. How many of us remain trapped in jobs we hate because we can't risk losing insurance? How many entrepreneurs never start businesses because they can't afford to sacrifice employer coverage? How many workers accept abuse because a health crisis without insurance means financial ruin?

The "how will we pay for it" crowd mysteriously disappears when it's time for another aircraft carrier or tax cut for the wealthy. But suggest that Americans deserve the same healthcare security enjoyed by citizens of every other advanced democracy, and suddenly the nation that put people on the moon can't figure out how to implement a system that works everywhere else.

## Enhanced Social Security

After 45 years working as a plumber, Robert's body gave out before his mortgage did. His Social Security check – $1,842 a month – barely covers his medications and utilities, let alone food and housing. Meanwhile, his former boss, who earned five times what Robert did, receives the same maximum benefit because earnings above $160,200 aren't subject to Social Security taxes. This isn't coincidence – it's policy.

The myth that Social Security is "going broke" has been used to terrify the elderly and justify benefit cuts for decades. Meanwhile, a simple solution has always existed: remove the cap on taxable income. If millionaires paid the same 6.2% on all their income that you pay on yours, the system would be solvent indefinitely, with room for expanded benefits.

The investment industry has spent billions promoting the fiction that Social Security is unsustainable, because they want your retirement savings in their fee-generating accounts, not in a secure public system. Every frightening headline about Social Security's impending doom helps funnel more money into 401(k)s, IRAs, and other private retirement vehicles where Wall Street can extract its cut.

True retirement security would mean expanding benefits to provide actual dignified aging – not just bare subsistence. It would mean creating dependent senior care support integrated into the system, recognizing that aging parents shouldn't have to choose between quality care and impoverishing themselves. It would mean acknowledging that a society wealthy enough to create multiple trillion-dollar tech companies can certainly afford to ensure its elderly don't eat cat food to survive.

When they say we can't afford better Social Security benefits, what they mean is they don't want to pay for them. The money exists – it's just currently sitting in offshore accounts and luxury real estate instead of supporting dignified retirements for the workers who built this country.

## Family and Community Support Systems

Jenny wakes at 5 AM to dress her children before dropping them at her mother's house on her way to her first job. Her mom is 70 and shouldn't be chasing toddlers, but quality childcare would cost $2,300 a month – more than Jenny's rent. When her son gets sick, she faces an impossible choice: stay home and lose a day's wages (and maybe her job), or send him to school sick. Meanwhile, politicians give speeches about "family values" while voting against paid family leave for the 23rd time.

It's a special kind of American exceptionalism to call ourselves "pro-family" while being the only developed nation without paid family leave. Our national mythology venerates motherhood while creating a system where giving birth can mean financial ruin. We lecture about "family values" while forcing parents to choose between staying home with a sick child or keeping their job.

Universal childcare isn't some radical socialist plot – it's economic common sense. When quality, affordable childcare is available, more parents can work, businesses have access to more talent, and children receive early education that pays dividends for decades. The return on investment for early childhood education is among the highest of any public spending. But mention public support for families, and suddenly we're concerned about "handouts."

The expanded Child Tax Credit briefly lifted millions of children out of poverty before it was allowed to expire – because apparently child poverty is less troubling than the prospect of poor families receiving government assistance. In just six months, it reduced child poverty by 30%, improved nutrition, decreased financial stress, and increased parents' ability to work. Its expiration was a policy choice that immediately threw those same children back into poverty.

Paid family and medical leave exists in every other developed country because it works. It reduces employee turnover, increases productivity, improves health outcomes, and strengthens family bonds. The apocalyptic warnings from business lobbies about how it would destroy companies have been tested in dozens of countries and states – and proven consistently false.

The economic sleight-of-hand that renders care work "unproductive" is perhaps the greatest accounting fraud in history. The labor that maintains human life and raises the next generation is treated as economically invisible – until it stops. Only when schools close or childcare disappears do we suddenly realize this "unproductive" work is actually the foundation that makes all other economic activity possible.

## Housing Guarantees

Marcus works two full-time jobs but still spends 58% of his income on a one-bedroom apartment in a neighborhood with rising crime and failing schools. Each year, his rent increases while maintenance requests go ignored. His landlord lives in another state and owns 12,000 units across the country. When Marcus asked about the latest rent hike, the property manager shrugged and said, "Market rates." Meanwhile, three luxury condo buildings in his city sit half-empty, owned mostly by investors who visit twice a year.

The housing crisis isn't a natural disaster – it's a policy choice. We've decided, collectively and deliberately, that homes should be primarily investment vehicles rather than places to live. The result is a system where Wall Street firms own suburban neighborhoods, foreign investors park money in empty luxury apartments, and working Americans spend over half their income on housing.

Public housing in America has been deliberately starved, stigmatized, and sabotaged. Compare Singapore, where over 80% of residents live in high-quality public housing that builds equity, to American public housing projects designed to concentrate poverty and minimize government responsibility. The difference isn't capability – it's political will.

Rent control has been demonized by the same investment firms buying up housing stock to create artificial scarcity. The "supply and demand" explanations for housing costs conveniently ignore how foreign capital, speculation, short-term rentals, and corporate purchasing distort local markets. When housing financialization delivers double-digit returns to investors, the "invisible hand" becomes remarkably visible in local zoning boards.

Community land trusts, cooperative housing, and alternative ownership models offer proven alternatives to the binary choice between unchecked market exploitation and failed public housing projects. These models provide security, build community wealth, and preserve affordability – which is precisely why they're marginalized in policy discussions dominated by development interests.

The deliberate confusion between "home prices" and "housing costs" serves those profiting from the current system. Rising home prices are celebrated as economic good news, even as they make shelter increasingly unaffordable for larger segments of the population. We've created a system where housing is too expensive to buy and too expensive to rent, with homelessness as the predictable result.

## Environmental and Infrastructure Investment

The water in Sheila's town has been undrinkable for three years. The pipes are lead, the treatment plant is failing, and the local government can't afford repairs because the factory that once provided tax revenue closed and moved operations to Mexico. Meanwhile, bottled water companies extract millions of gallons from nearby springs for pennies, bottle it in plastic made from fossil fuels, and sell it back to Sheila for $1.79 per liter. The free market at work.

The fossil fuel industry's greatest achievement isn't technological – it's persuading us that addressing climate change requires sacrifice rather than investment. The Green New Deal has been painted as some radical fever dream, rather than what it actually is: a jobs, infrastructure, and industrial policy that addresses the existential threat of our time while creating millions of good-paying jobs.

America's infrastructure is crumbling because we decided maintenance isn't sexy. Politicians can't cut ribbons on repaired bridges or updated electrical grids. The result is a system where we wait for catastrophic failures before acting, then pay multiples of what preventive maintenance would have cost. It's not fiscal conservatism – it's fiscal malpractice.

Public transportation in America is caught in a deliberately engineered death spiral. We underfund it, watch service decline, use that decline to justify further cuts, then act surprised when ridership falls. Meanwhile, we subsidize highways, parking, and fossil fuels to the tune of hundreds of billions, then claim public transit "can't pay for itself." It's socialized costs for private transportation and market discipline for public options.

Environmental justice is inseparable from economic justice. It's no accident that polluting facilities are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color. The same power dynamics that extract wealth from workers extract health from marginalized communities. The same corporate influence that shapes labor policy shapes environmental enforcement.

The "jobs versus environment" framing serves those profiting from the status quo. The reality is that renewable energy already creates more jobs per dollar invested than fossil fuels. Retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency is labor-intensive work that can't be outsourced. Ecosystem restoration and climate adaptation require boots on the ground. The transition isn't about fewer jobs – it's about different jobs, and different profit centers.

## Democratic Economic Institutions

When Lakeville's public water system needed upgrades, a private company offered to take it over, promising efficiency and investment. Five years later, rates had doubled, service complaints had tripled, and the company had extracted millions in profits while postponing most of the promised improvements. The town council that approved the privatization deal included three members who now work for the water company. This isn't corruption – it's business as usual.

The "there is no alternative" narrative is perhaps the most successful propaganda campaign in modern history. We're told that publicly owned utilities, banks, internet service providers, or transportation systems are somehow contrary to American values – conveniently ignoring that hundreds of American cities successfully run municipal utilities, that North Dakota operates a public bank, that Chattanooga provides public broadband, and that most of our transportation infrastructure was built and is maintained by the public sector.

Public banking offers a proven alternative to the extraction model of Wall Street. The Bank of North Dakota has operated successfully for over a century, helping the state weather financial crises while supporting small businesses, funding student loans at reasonable rates, and partnering with community banks. But mention public banking elsewhere, and you'd think someone had suggested Soviet-style central planning.

Worker ownership isn't some utopian concept – it's a proven business model operating successfully across the country and around the world. Companies like New Belgium Brewing and Bob's Red Mill operate as employee-owned enterprises. The Mondragon Corporation in Spain employs over 80,000 people in a cooperative structure. These models deliver better job security, more equitable compensation, and often greater productivity and innovation than their extractive counterparts.

Corporate charter reform recognizes a basic truth: corporations exist by public permission. They are legal constructs granted special privileges by society, including limited liability for their owners. The idea that these artificial entities should be required to consider impacts beyond short-term shareholder returns isn't radical – it's a return to the original purpose of incorporation as a public benefit mechanism.

Labor law in America has been systematically dismantled to the point where union busting is treated as a standard business expense. The National Labor Relations Board is so underfunded and penalties for violations so minimal that companies routinely break the law as a cost-benefit calculation. Restoring labor rights doesn't require revolution – it requires enforcing the laws already on the books and updating them for the modern economy.

## Private Equity Reform

Picture a hospital where nurses are stretched so thin they can barely check on patients, where basic supplies run out mid-shift, but somehow there's money for a gleaming new sign with the private equity firm's corporate branding. That's what happened when Steward Health Care, owned by Cerberus Capital Management, loaded 33 hospitals with $5 billion in debt then extracted over $800 million in fees and dividends before abandoning them to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, patients died from preventable causes as care quality plummeted.

Private equity has perfected a business model so cynical it makes old-school robber barons look like amateurs. These financial predators operate like specialized parasites that don't just feed off the host – they hijack its nervous system. First, raise money from already-wealthy investors. Then buy a functioning, often profitable business. But here's the twist – make the business itself take out the loans that funded its own purchase. It's like forcing someone to take out a mortgage to pay their own ransom.

Once the company is saddled with crushing debt, the extraction begins. Cut staff, slash benefits, sell off assets, delay maintenance – anything to create "efficiencies" while paying yourself massive "management fees" regardless of performance. The carried interest loophole ensures these billionaire fund managers pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. It's a tax dodge with roots in 16th-century shipping that allows them to classify what is obviously compensation as investment income – because calling your income by a different name is apparently all it takes to cut your tax bill in half.

When leveraged buyouts hit the news in the 1980s, they targeted manufacturing. Today, private equity has its tentacles in everything from housing to healthcare to local newspapers. Toys "R" Us collapsed under $5 billion in debt from its leveraged buyout, destroying 33,000 jobs. Nursing homes acquired by private equity show higher patient mortality rates. Local newspapers gutted by firms like Alden Global Capital leave communities without watchdogs, allowing corruption to flourish.

Restricting leveraged buyouts isn't anti-capitalist – it's pro-functional markets. Requiring private equity firms to maintain minimum staffing and quality standards in essential services isn't radical – it's basic consumer protection. Eliminating the carried interest loophole isn't class warfare – it's tax fairness. And preventing essential services like healthcare, elder care, housing, and local news from becoming extraction opportunities isn't socialism – it's preserving the infrastructure of a functioning society.

The private equity playbook creates monopolies by design – firms pass the same companies back and forth between them, consolidating industries until competition is eliminated and prices can be raised at will. Then they extract maximum profit while providing minimum service, secure in the knowledge that consumers have nowhere else to go. It's not capitalism; it's organized extraction under the veneer of investment.

## Antitrust Resurrection

When Sarah's local newspaper closed, she didn't think much of it – she got her news online anyway. Then the county commission quietly approved a tax break for a chemical plant that later contaminated the local river. No reporters were there to cover it. The plant's parent company owns the only TV station in town, which ran stories about the jobs created but nothing about the tax breaks or the pollution. The parent company's CEO plays golf with the governor.

The ghost of Louis Brandeis must be screaming into the void as we've allowed monopoly power to reconcentrate to Gilded Age levels. The "consumer welfare" standard that replaced actual antitrust enforcement is a spectacular failure on its own terms – consumers pay higher prices, receive worse service, and have fewer choices across industries from airlines to internet service to eyeglasses.

Monopoly power isn't just about prices – it's about control. When four companies control 80% of meat processing, farmers take whatever price they're offered. When hospital mergers eliminate competition, not only do prices rise, but quality falls and workers lose leverage. When tech platforms become unavoidable intermediaries, they set the rules for millions of businesses and billions of users.

Restoring actual antitrust enforcement isn't some radical proposition – it's returning to the bipartisan consensus that prevailed for most of the 20th century. Breaking up concentrated economic power was once an American tradition, not a fringe position. President Teddy Roosevelt, hardly a communist, made his name as a trust-buster. Today, suggesting that maybe four companies shouldn't control 80% of meat processing, or that perhaps two companies shouldn't dominate social media, is treated as an attack on capitalism itself.

Moving beyond the consumer welfare standard means recognizing that monopoly has costs beyond consumer prices. It kills innovation by allowing dominant firms to buy or crush potential competitors. It suppresses wages by reducing labor market competition. It corrupts democracy by concentrating economic and political power. And it undermines communities by centralizing economic decision-making in distant corporate headquarters.

Breaking concentrated economic power isn't just about creating fairer markets – it's about preserving democracy itself. When companies become too big to fail, too powerful to regulate, and too influential to challenge, they threaten the foundations of self-government. The choice isn't between capitalism and socialism – it's between a system where economic power is dispersed and one where it's concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.

## Financial Sector Containment

Every three months, Wall Street holds its breath for the ritual of quarterly earnings calls. Miss projections by a few pennies per share, and your company's stock plunges. Announce layoffs – even when profitable – and watch your stock soar. Meanwhile, a teacher in Kansas who invested her retirement savings in that company's stock through her 403(b) has no idea that high-frequency trading algorithms are buying and selling her future security thousands of times per second, extracting microscopic amounts with each transaction until they add up to billions.

The financial sector has transformed from a service industry that facilitated productive investment into an extraction industry that dominates the economy. Banking, insurance, and investment used to account for about 10% of corporate profits in the 1950s. Today, they claim around 30% – not because they're creating more value, but because they've positioned themselves to extract more from every economic transaction.

Financial transaction taxes offer the rare policy that simultaneously reduces harmful speculative trading, raises substantial revenue, and protects productive investment. A tax so small that average investors would barely notice it would raise billions from high-frequency traders whose entire business model relies on microsecond advantages. Yet the idea remains "controversial" because the financial industry's congressional influence matches its economic power.

Public banking options would provide basic financial services without predatory fees, interest rates, or discriminatory practices. The Postal Service successfully provided basic banking services for decades, and could do so again, ensuring that everyone has access to banking regardless of income or location. Meanwhile, the same banks that charge $35 overdraft fees receive near-zero-interest loans from the Federal Reserve whenever they need liquidity.

Executive compensation has reached levels that would make the pharaohs blush, particularly in the financial sector. CEOs now make 400 times the median worker's salary, up from about 20 times in the 1950s. This isn't because today's executives are 20 times more talented than their predecessors – it's because they've rigged the system through stock buybacks, compensation committees filled with fellow executives, and the ideology that shareholder value is the only metric that matters.

Making financial fraud unprofitable means ending the practice of fines without admission of wrongdoing. When banks can defraud consumers of billions and pay millions in fines, it's not punishment – it's a business expense. When executives who authorized illegal practices never face personal consequences, the message is clear: crime pays, as long as you're wealthy enough. Treating financial crimes like the serious violations they are – with actual prison time for those responsible – would change the risk calculation overnight.

## Democratic Corporate Governance

Miguel works at a factory that's been in his town for three generations. Last week, a private equity firm announced they're buying the company. This week, rumors are flying about "restructuring." No one asked the workers, the town, or anyone else who'll be affected. The boardroom decision will impact thousands of lives, but those people have no voice. They're just "externalities" in a spreadsheet somewhere.

Worker representation on corporate boards isn't some radical socialist fantasy – it's standard practice in Germany, where workers hold up to half the seats on supervisory boards of large companies. This "co-determination" model hasn't destroyed German capitalism; it's created one of the world's most successful manufacturing economies, with higher wages, better job security, and more innovation than the American approach of treating workers as disposable costs.

Community impact requirements would recognize that corporations don't exist in a vacuum – they depend on public infrastructure, educated workforces, and stable communities. When a factory that received tax breaks and infrastructure support from a town for decades suddenly relocates to capture slightly higher short-term returns, that's not just business – it's a betrayal of the implicit social contract that made the business possible in the first place.

Shareholder primacy – the idea that maximizing returns to shareholders is a corporation's only legitimate purpose – isn't written in stone or even in most corporate charters. It's a relatively recent ideology that serves the financial sector above all others. Corporate law allows directors to consider impacts on workers, communities, customers, and the environment – but the quarterly earnings pressure works against this broader view.

Co-determination models have succeeded across Europe not just in terms of worker wellbeing, but in long-term corporate performance. Companies with worker representation tend to invest more in research and development, maintain higher quality standards, and take a longer-term view of success. They're less likely to engage in short-sighted cost-cutting that boosts quarterly earnings at the expense of long-term sustainability.

The idea that corporations should operate solely to maximize shareholder returns ignores the reality that corporations are legal constructs created by society, through government, to serve broader economic purposes. They exist by public permission and receive enormous benefits, from limited liability to legal personhood. Requiring them to consider their full impact isn't punishment – it's asking them to live up to the social contract that gives them their privileges in the first place.

## Progressive Taxation

Jeff works at an Amazon warehouse, walking 15 miles a day in a non-air-conditioned facility while timed bathroom breaks are logged against his productivity metrics. He pays a higher effective tax rate than his employer did during years when it reported billions in profits. When he asks how this is possible, financial experts explain the sophisticated "tax strategies" that allow the wealthiest corporations and individuals to legally avoid what ordinary workers can't. This isn't a broken system – it's working exactly as designed.

The genius of modern conservatism is convincing working Americans that billionaires need protection from tax collectors. What started with Reagan's "welfare queen" mythology has evolved into a religion where the ultra-wealthy are treated as a protected class, their fortunes somehow more sacrosanct than the lives of those who can't afford insulin.

Our tax code reads like it was written by oligarchs – because it was. The carried interest loophole lets hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. Corporations build headquarters in Ireland while using American infrastructure. Billionaires borrow against their stock portfolios to avoid ever selling shares and triggering capital gains taxes. It's not evasion; it's "strategy."

The estate tax – rebranded as the "death tax" in a marketing coup that Don Draper would envy – has been gutted to the point where dynastic wealth passes from generation to generation virtually untouched. The architects of American democracy understood the dangers of aristocracy. Today's politicians understand the benefits of aristocratic campaign donations.

A wealth tax isn't radical – what's radical is allowing three men to own more wealth than the bottom half of Americans combined. What's radical is watching teachers pay higher effective tax rates than billionaires. What's radical is accepting a system where Amazon can pay zero federal income tax in years when it made billions in profit.

The "job creator" mythology serves as the modern equivalent of divine right – a religious justification for why certain people deserve to control nation-state levels of wealth while others work full-time jobs and still need food stamps. When workers demand higher wages, they're told it would destroy jobs. When executives demand nine-figure compensation packages, they're "attracting top talent."

## Public Internet and Digital Commons

Diego used to shop at locally owned stores, read news from independent journalists, and socialize in community spaces. Now he buys everything through Amazon, gets "news" from algorithmic feeds optimized to keep him angry and engaged, and maintains relationships through platforms that track and monetize his every interaction. This didn't happen because digital options are inherently better – it happened because a handful of companies have monopolized the digital square, capturing both commerce and communication.

The internet – created through public investment, developed in public institutions, and initially operated as a commons – has been captured by a handful of corporations that have transformed it from a democratic space into a series of extraction points. The promise of digital democracy has been replaced by surveillance capitalism, where we're both product and consumer.

Municipal broadband offers communities the opportunity to treat internet service as essential infrastructure rather than a profit center. Cities like Chattanooga have demonstrated that publicly owned networks can deliver faster speeds at lower prices while reaching underserved areas private companies won't touch. The response from telecom monopolies? Lobbying for state laws to ban municipal broadband, ensuring that neither public options nor actual competition can threaten their extraction model.

Digital public spaces not driven by surveillance and engagement optimization aren't some utopian fantasy – they're the original vision of the internet. Platforms designed to serve users rather than advertisers, networks that connect without manipulating, communities governed by members rather than algorithms optimized for time-on-site – these alternatives exist but are systematically marginalized by the dominant players.

Data rights frameworks recognize that the information generated by our digital lives shouldn't automatically become the property of corporations. The European GDPR, for all its flaws, at least attempts to establish that people have rights regarding information about them. In America, we've allowed companies to claim ownership of data they merely collected, not created, enabling surveillance and manipulation on an unprecedented scale.

Creating a public internet doesn't require nationalizing Facebook or Google. It requires investing in alternative infrastructure, establishing proper regulation, enforcing antitrust laws, protecting data rights, and fostering the development of non-extractive alternatives. It requires recognizing that communication networks have always required public governance to serve the common good.

## The Path Forward

The policies outlined above aren't revolutionary – they're restorative. They would return us to the more balanced capitalism that produced America's greatest period of widespread prosperity. They would rebuild the middle class that decades of extractive policies have hollowed out. And they would create a society where democracy isn't just a ritual we perform on Election Day, but a reality we live in our communities and workplaces.

The Four Horsemen policies we explored in the previous chapter would shift power dynamics within the existing system. The additional policies outlined here would transform the system itself, creating the conditions for a truly democratic economy and society. Together, they offer not just a critique of what's wrong, but a vision of what's possible when we break the chokepoints of concentrated power.
