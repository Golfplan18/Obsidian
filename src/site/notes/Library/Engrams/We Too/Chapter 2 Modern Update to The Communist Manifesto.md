# Modern Update to The Communist Manifesto

A specter is haunting the world—the specter of collective ownership. All the powers of the old order have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: traditional political leaders and religious authorities, conservatives and liberals, security agencies and media conglomerates.

Where is the opposition party that hasn't been labeled "communist" by those in power? Where is the opposition that hasn't thrown the accusation of communism back at more progressive parties as well as at its reactionary opponents?

Two things result from this fact:

1. Collective ownership is already acknowledged by all powers to be itself a power.
2. It's time for advocates of collective ownership to openly publish their views, aims, and tendencies, and to counter this nursery tale of the "Communist Specter" with a clear statement of principles.

To this end, advocates of collective ownership from various countries have assembled and drafted the following manifesto.

## I. Wealthy Elite and Wage-Dependent Class

The history of all societies has been the history of class struggles. Throughout history—whether between freemen and slaves, nobles and commoners, lords and serfs, or craft masters and workers—oppressors and oppressed have constantly opposed each other. This conflict, sometimes hidden and sometimes open, has always ended either in society being fundamentally changed or in the mutual destruction of both classes.

In earlier periods of history, we find almost everywhere a complex arrangement of society into various ranks and positions. In ancient Rome, there were patricians, knights, plebeians, and slaves. In medieval times, there were feudal lords, vassals, guild masters, journeymen, apprentices, and serfs. In almost all these classes, there were further gradations.

Modern society hasn't eliminated class conflicts. It has simply established new classes, new conditions of oppression, and new forms of struggle to replace the old ones.

Our era—the era of the wealthy elite—has simplified class antagonisms. Society is increasingly splitting into two great hostile camps: the Wealthy Elite and the Wage-Dependent Class.

From the serfs of the Middle Ages came the first urban workers. From these early workers, the first elements of the wealthy elite developed.

The discovery of America and new sea routes to Asia created new markets for the rising wealthy elite. These markets, colonial trade, and increased exchange of goods gave unprecedented momentum to commerce, shipping, and industry, and thereby accelerated the decline of feudal society.

The feudal system of production organized through guilds could no longer meet the growing demands of new markets. Manufacturing replaced it. Guild masters were pushed aside by the industrial middle class. The division of labor between different guilds disappeared in favor of division of labor within individual workshops.

But markets kept growing and demand kept rising. Even manufacturing proved inadequate. Steam power and machinery revolutionized industrial production. Mass production replaced manufacturing, and industrial millionaires—the modern wealthy elite—replaced the middle-class manufacturers.

Modern industry created the global market, which began with the discovery of America. This market greatly expanded trade, shipping, and land transportation. These developments further expanded industry. As industry, commerce, shipping, and railways grew, the wealthy elite also grew their power and wealth, pushing aside the older social classes from medieval times.

The wealthy elite is the product of a long development process involving a series of revolutions in production and exchange methods.

Each stage in the development of the wealthy elite was accompanied by corresponding political advancement. An oppressed class under feudal nobility, then self-governing associations in medieval communes, then "third estate" taxpayers in monarchies, and finally the exclusive political power in modern representative governments—the wealthy elite has at last won complete political control. Modern government is simply a committee for managing the common affairs of the entire wealthy elite.

The wealthy elite has played a truly revolutionary role in history.

Wherever it has gained power, it has destroyed feudal, patriarchal, and idyllic relationships. It has pitilessly torn apart the complex ties that bound people to their "natural superiors," leaving no connection between people except naked self-interest and callous payment. It has drowned religious fervor, chivalric enthusiasm, and sentimental nostalgia in the icy water of selfish calculation. It has reduced personal worth to exchange value and replaced numerous hard-won freedoms with the single, merciless freedom of "free trade." In short, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, and brutal exploitation for exploitation that was veiled by religious and political illusions.

The wealthy elite has stripped the halo from every profession previously honored and looked up to with reverence. It has turned doctors, lawyers, priests, poets, and scientists into its paid employees.

The wealthy elite has torn away the sentimental veil from family relationships and reduced them to purely financial transactions.

The wealthy elite has revealed how the brutal display of force in medieval times, which reactionaries so admire, found its natural complement in the laziest indolence. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals. It has conducted expeditions far more impressive than all former migrations of peoples and crusades.

The wealthy elite cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing production, disrupting social conditions, and creating endless uncertainty and agitation. All fixed, established relationships, with their train of ancient and respected beliefs and opinions, are swept away; new ones become outdated before they can solidify. Everything established and stable evaporates, everything sacred is profaned, and people are finally forced to face the real conditions of their lives and their relationships with others with clear minds.

The need for constantly expanding markets drives the wealthy elite across the entire globe. They must establish connections everywhere.

Through exploiting the world market, the wealthy elite has made production and consumption international. Despite the protests of reactionaries, they have removed the national foundation from under industries. Traditional national industries have been destroyed and continue to be destroyed daily. They are replaced by new industries whose products are consumed worldwide. These industries no longer use local raw materials but draw them from the most distant regions. Their products are consumed not only domestically but in every part of the world. National self-sufficiency and isolation have given way to global interdependence. This happens in material production and also in intellectual creation. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become increasingly impossible, and from the many national and local literatures, a world literature arises.

The wealthy elite rapidly improve all instruments of production and greatly enhance communication, drawing even the most remote regions into civilization. Their cheap products are the heavy artillery with which they batter down all Chinese Walls and force "barbarian" nations to adopt their mode of production. They compel all nations to adopt this new economic system or face extinction. They force them to introduce so-called civilization into their midst—that is, to become like the wealthy elite themselves. In short, they create a world in their own image.

The wealthy elite have subjected rural areas to urban rule. They have created enormous cities, vastly increased urban populations compared to rural ones, and rescued a significant portion of the population from rural isolation. Just as they've made the countryside dependent on cities, they've made non-industrialized countries dependent on industrialized ones, agricultural nations on manufacturing nations, and the East on the West.

The wealthy elite increasingly eliminate the scattered state of the population, means of production, and property. They have centralized population, concentrated the means of production, and concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence was political centralization. Independent or loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and tax systems, were brought together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class interest, one border, and one customs tariff.

During its rule of barely one hundred years, the wealthy elite has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than all preceding generations combined. They have harnessed natural forces, introduced machinery, applied chemistry to industry and agriculture, developed steam navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, cleared whole continents for cultivation, made rivers navigable, and created whole populations seemingly out of thin air. What earlier century could have imagined that such productive forces lay dormant in the womb of social labor?

We have seen that the means of production and exchange that formed the basis of the wealthy elite were created in feudal society. At a certain stage, the feudal relations of property became incompatible with the already developed productive forces. They became fetters that had to be broken, and they were broken.

They were replaced by free competition, along with a social and political system appropriate to it and the economic and political dominance of the wealthy elite.

A similar movement is now occurring before our eyes. Modern society, with its relations of production, exchange, and property—a society that has created such powerful means of production and exchange—is like a sorcerer who can no longer control the powers of the underworld that they have called up. For decades, the history of industry and commerce has been the history of modern productive forces revolting against modern production relations—against the property relations that are essential for the wealthy elite's existence and rule. Commercial crises, by their periodic return, increasingly threaten the existence of the entire wealthy elite society. During these crises, a significant portion of not only existing products but also previously created productive forces are regularly destroyed. A strange epidemic breaks out in these crises—an epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself back in a momentary state of barbarism; it appears as if a famine or a universal war has cut off supplies; industry and commerce seem destroyed. Why? Because society has too much civilization, too many means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at society's disposal no longer further the development of wealthy elite property relations. On the contrary, they have become too powerful for these relations and are held back by them. When they break through these fetters, they bring disorder to wealthy elite society and endanger the existence of wealthy elite property. The wealthy elite system is too narrow to contain the wealth it creates. How does the wealthy elite overcome these crises? On one hand, by destroying a mass of productive forces; on the other, by conquering new markets and more thoroughly exploiting old ones. How? By paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises and diminishing the means of preventing them.

The wealthy elite used economic tools to defeat feudalism, but now these same tools threaten their own position. They've not only created the weapons of their own destruction but also produced the people who will use these weapons—the modern wage-dependent class.

As capital develops, the wage-dependent class develops as well. This class only lives so long as it finds work, and it finds work only so long as its labor increases capital. These workers, who must sell themselves piece by piece, are a commodity like any other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition and market fluctuations.

Due to extensive use of machinery and division of labor, the work of the wage-dependent class has lost all individual character and attraction. The worker becomes a mere appendage of the machine, required to perform only the simplest, most monotonous, and most easily learned tasks. Therefore, the cost of the worker is limited almost entirely to the means of subsistence needed for their maintenance and reproduction. But the price of a commodity, including labor, equals its cost of production. As the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Even more, as machinery and division of labor increase, the burden of work increases, whether through longer working hours, increased work demanded in a given time, or accelerated machine speeds.

Modern industry has converted the small workshop of the artisan into the large factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of workers, crowded into factories, are organized like soldiers. As privates in the industrial army, they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. They are not only slaves of the wealthy elite class and the wealthy elite state but are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the supervisor, and, above all, by the individual factory owner. This despotism becomes more hateful and bitter the more openly it proclaims profit-making as its purpose.

The less skill and physical strength required in manual labor, the more modern industry develops, the more women's work displaces men's. Age and gender differences no longer have social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labor, more or less expensive to use, depending on their age and gender.

As soon as the worker's exploitation by the factory owner ends with receiving their cash wage, they are set upon by other portions of the wealthy elite—the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

The lower strata of the middle class—small business owners, shopkeepers, retired tradespeople, artisans, and farmers—all sink into the wage-dependent class. This happens partly because their small capital doesn't suffice for large-scale industry and is overwhelmed by competition with large capitalists, and partly because their specialized skills are devalued by new production methods. The wage-dependent class is thus recruited from all classes of the population.

The wage-dependent class goes through various stages of development. Their struggle with the wealthy elite begins with their very existence. At first, individual workers fight, then the workers at a single factory, then the workers of one trade in one locality against the individual wealthy elite who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against wealthy elite production relations but against the instruments of production themselves. They destroy imported goods that compete with their labor, smash machinery, burn factories, and try to restore the lost status of the medieval worker.

At this stage, workers form an incoherent mass scattered across the country and divided by competition. If workers unite, this is not yet due to their own active unity but due to the unity of the wealthy elite, which must mobilize the entire wage-dependent class to achieve its own political goals. At this stage, workers don't fight their own enemies but the enemies of their enemies—the remnants of absolute monarchy, landowners, and non-industrial wealthy elite. The entire historical movement is thus concentrated in the hands of the wealthy elite; every victory so obtained is a victory for the wealthy elite.

But as industry develops, the wage-dependent class not only increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the wage-dependent class become more and more equalized as machinery obliterates work distinctions and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. Growing competition among the wealthy elite and resulting commercial crises make workers' wages increasingly unstable. The ever-improving machinery makes their livelihoods more precarious. Collisions between individual workers and individual wealthy elite increasingly take the character of collisions between two classes. Workers begin to form unions against the wealthy elite; they band together to maintain wage rates. They form permanent associations to prepare for these occasional revolts. Here and there, the struggle breaks out into riots.

Sometimes workers are victorious, but only temporarily. The real fruit of their battles lies not in immediate success but in the expanding unity of workers. This unity is helped by improved communication created by modern industry that connects workers in different locations. It's this connection that's needed to centralize the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into a national struggle between classes. Every class struggle is a political struggle. And the union that medieval citizens needed centuries to establish, with their primitive roads, modern workers achieve in a few years thanks to railways.

The organization of the wage-dependent class into a class, and consequently into a political party, is continually disrupted by competition among the workers themselves. But it always rises again, stronger, firmer, and more powerful. It takes advantage of divisions among the wealthy elite themselves and forces recognition of workers' interests in legal form. Examples include the ten-hour workday law in England.

Conflicts within the old society generally further the development of the wage-dependent class. The wealthy elite finds itself in constant battle. Initially with the aristocracy, later with those portions of the wealthy elite whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry, and always with the wealthy elite of other countries. In all these battles, it is forced to appeal to the wage-dependent class, to ask for its help, and thus to draw it into the political arena. The wealthy elite itself, therefore, supplies the wage-dependent class with its own elements of political and general education—in other words, it provides weapons against itself.

As we've seen, entire sections of the ruling class are thrown into the wage-dependent class by the advance of industry, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. They also supply the wage-dependent class with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.

Finally, as the class struggle nears its decisive hour, the dissolution process within the ruling class, within the whole old society, assumes such a violent character that a small portion of the ruling class breaks away and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, in the past, a section of the nobility went over to the wealthy elite, now a portion of the wealthy elite goes over to the wage-dependent class, particularly some of the wealthy elite intellectuals who have achieved a theoretical understanding of the entire historical movement.

Of all the classes that confront the wealthy elite today, only the wage-dependent class is truly revolutionary. Other classes decay and finally disappear with modern industry; the wage-dependent class is its special and essential product.

The lower middle class—small manufacturers, small merchants, artisans, farmers—all fight against the wealthy elite to save their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are not revolutionary but conservative. Even more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If they are revolutionary, it's only because they face joining the wage-dependent class; they defend not their present interests but their future interests. They abandon their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the wage-dependent class.

The "dangerous class," the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society, may be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution. Its conditions of life, however, prepare it more for the role of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.

The social conditions of the old society no longer exist for the wage-dependent class. The wage-dependent worker has no property; their relationship with their spouse and children has nothing in common with modern wealthy elite family relations. Modern industrial labor, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped the worker of every trace of national character. Law, morality, and religion are to the worker merely wealthy elite prejudices, behind which lurk wealthy elite interests.

All previous classes that won power sought to secure their already acquired status by subjecting society to their conditions of appropriation. The wage-dependent class can only win the productive forces of society by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby abolishing all previous modes of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure and fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.

All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The wage-dependent class movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The wage-dependent class, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot rise up without exploding the whole superstructure of social classes above it.

Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the wage-dependent class against the wealthy elite is at first a national struggle. The wage-dependent class of each country must, of course, first settle matters with its own wealthy elite.

In outlining the most general phases of the development of the wage-dependent class, we traced the more or less veiled civil war raging within existing society up to the point where it breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the wealthy elite lays the foundation for the power of the wage-dependent class.

All previous societies have been based, as we have seen, on the antagonism between oppressing and oppressed classes. But to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured under which it can continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a member of the wealthy elite. The modern worker, on the contrary, instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. This clearly proves that the wealthy elite is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society and to impose its conditions of existence on society as an overriding law. It is unfit to rule because it cannot assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this wealthy elite—that is, the wealthy elite's existence is no longer compatible with society.

The essential conditions for the existence and rule of the wealthy elite class are the formation and growth of capital; the condition for capital is wage labor. Wage labor rests exclusively on competition between the workers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the wealthy elite, replaces the isolation of the workers due to competition with their revolutionary unity due to association. Thus, the development of modern industry cuts from under the wealthy elite's feet the very foundation on which they produce and appropriate products. What the wealthy elite therefore produces, above all, are their own grave-diggers. Their fall and the victory of the wage-dependent class are equally inevitable.

## II. The Wage-Dependent Class and Advocates of Collective Ownership

What is the relationship between advocates of collective ownership and the wage-dependent class as a whole?

Advocates of collective ownership do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties. They have no interests separate from those of the wage-dependent class as a whole.

They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own to shape and mold the working-class movement.

Advocates of collective ownership differ from other working-class parties in only two ways:

1. In national struggles of workers in different countries, they point out and bring forward the common interests of the entire wage-dependent class, regardless of nationality.
2. In the various stages of development through which the struggle between the wage-dependent class and the wealthy elite passes, they always represent the interests of the movement as a whole.

Therefore, advocates of collective ownership are practically the most advanced and determined section of working-class parties in every country—the section that pushes forward all others. Theoretically, they have the advantage of clearly understanding the conditions, direction, and ultimate results of the wage-dependent class movement.

The immediate aim of advocates of collective ownership is the same as that of all other working-class parties: formation of the wage-dependent class into a class, overthrow of wealthy elite rule, conquest of political power by the wage-dependent class.

The theoretical conclusions of collective ownership are not based on ideas or principles invented or discovered by some would-be universal reformer. They merely express, in general terms, actual conditions of an existing class struggle and historical movement taking place before our eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not uniquely characteristic of collective ownership.

All property relations in the past have continually changed with historical conditions. For example, the French Revolution abolished feudal property in favor of wealthy elite property.

The distinguishing feature of collective ownership is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of wealthy elite property. Modern private property of the wealthy elite is the final and most complete expression of producing and appropriating products based on class antagonisms and on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of collective ownership may be summed up in a single sentence: Abolition of private property.

We advocates of collective ownership have been accused of wanting to abolish the right to personally acquire property as the fruit of one's own labor—property that is allegedly the basis of all personal freedom, activity, and independence.

Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Are you talking about the property of the petty artisan and small farmer—a form of property that preceded the wealthy elite form? There's no need to abolish that; the development of industry has largely destroyed it and continues to destroy it daily.

Or are you talking about modern wealthy elite private property?

But does wage labor create property for the wage worker? Not at all. It creates capital—property that exploits wage labor and can increase only by creating new wage labor for fresh exploitation. Property in its present form is based on the antagonism between capital and wage labor. Let's examine both sides of this antagonism.

To be a capitalist means having not only a personal position but a social position in production. Capital is a collective product and can be set in motion only by the united action of many members of society—ultimately, by the united action of all members of society.

Capital is therefore not a personal power, but a social power.

When capital is converted into common property, belonging to all members of society, it's not personal property that is transformed into social property. Only the social character of the property changes—it loses its class character.

Now let's look at wage labor.

The average price of wage labor is the minimum wage—the amount of necessities required to keep the worker alive as a worker. Therefore, the wage worker through their labor merely secures enough for bare existence and reproduction. We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of labor products needed for maintaining human life. This appropriation creates no surplus to give power over other people's labor. We want to eliminate the miserable character of this appropriation, where the worker lives merely to increase capital and is allowed to live only as long as the interests of the ruling class require it.

In wealthy elite society, living labor is only a means to increase accumulated labor. In a collective society, accumulated labor is only a means to enhance, enrich, and improve the life of the worker.

In wealthy elite society, the past dominates the present; in collective society, the present dominates the past. In wealthy elite society, capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.

And abolishing this state of affairs is called abolishing individuality and freedom by the wealthy elite! Rightly so. Abolishing wealthy elite individuality, independence, and freedom is precisely our aim.

By freedom, under current production conditions, they mean free trade, free buying and selling.

But if buying and selling disappears, so does free buying and selling. Talk about free buying and selling, like all the other "freedom" rhetoric of the wealthy elite, has meaning only in contrast with restricted buying and selling in earlier times. It has no meaning when opposing the collective abolition of buying and selling, of the wealthy elite conditions of production, and of the wealthy elite itself.

You are horrified that we intend to abolish private property. But in your existing society, private property is already abolished for nine-tenths of the population. It exists precisely because it doesn't exist for those nine-tenths. You reproach us for intending to abolish a form of property whose necessary condition is the non-existence of property for the immense majority of society.

In a word, you accuse us of intending to abolish your property. That's exactly what we intend.

From the moment labor can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent—into a social power capable of being monopolized—from the moment when personal property can no longer be transformed into wealthy elite property, into capital, from that moment, you claim, individuality is abolished.

You admit, then, that by "individual" you mean no one other than the wealthy elite owner. This person must indeed be swept away and made impossible.

Collective ownership deprives no one of the power to appropriate social products; it only removes the power to use such appropriation to subjugate the labor of others.

Some object that upon abolishing private property, all work will cease and universal laziness will take over.

If this were true, wealthy elite society would have collapsed long ago from idleness, because those who work acquire nothing, and those who acquire things don't work. This objection just restates the tautology that there can be no wage labor when there is no capital.

All objections against the collective mode of producing and appropriating material products have also been extended to the production and appropriation of intellectual work. Just as the wealthy elite sees the end of class property as the end of production itself, they see the end of class culture as the end of all culture.

The culture they mourn is, for the vast majority, merely training to act as a machine.

Don't argue with us by using your wealthy elite notions of freedom, culture, law, etc., to critique our intended abolition of wealthy elite property. Your very ideas are products of wealthy elite production and property relations. Just as your jurisprudence is only the will of your class made into law—a will whose content is determined by the material conditions of your class.

Your self-interested misconception—transforming into eternal laws of nature and reason the social relations springing from your current mode of production and property—is shared with all ruling classes before you. What you understand about ancient property or feudal property, you cannot, of course, understand about your own wealthy elite form of property.

Abolition of the family! Even the most radical become indignant at this infamous proposal of the advocates of collective ownership.

What is the basis of the present family—the wealthy elite family? It's based on capital and private gain. In its fully developed form, it exists only among the wealthy elite. But this state of things finds its complement in the forced absence of the family among workers and in public prostitution.

The wealthy elite family will naturally vanish with the vanishing of its complement, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.

Do you accuse us of wanting to stop parents from exploiting their children? We confess to this crime.

But you will say we destroy the most hallowed relationship by replacing home education with social education.

Isn't your education also determined by society? By the social conditions under which you educate? By the direct or indirect intervention of society through schools, etc.? Advocates of collective ownership aren't inventing society's influence on education; they merely seek to alter its character and rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.

The wealthy elite rhetoric about family and education, about the hallowed relationship between parents and children, becomes all the more disgusting as modern industry destroys all family ties for the workers and transforms their children into simple articles of commerce and tools of labor.

But the wealthy elite cry in chorus: "You want to introduce community of women!"

The wealthy elite see their wives as mere instruments of production. They hear that the instruments of production are to be commonly utilized and naturally conclude that women will share the same fate.

They have no clue that the point is to end the status of women as mere instruments of production.

Furthermore, nothing is more ridiculous than the wealthy elite's virtuous indignation at the supposed "official community of women" under collective ownership. Advocates of collective ownership don't need to introduce a community of women; it has almost always existed.

Our wealthy elite, not content with having the wives and daughters of their workers at their disposal—not to mention common prostitution—take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.

Wealthy elite marriage is really a system of wives in common. At most, advocates of collective ownership might be criticized for wanting to replace a hypocritically concealed community of women with an openly legalized one. Besides, it's obvious that with the abolition of current production relations, the community of women springing from them—that is, public and private prostitution—will also disappear.

Advocates of collective ownership are further criticized for wanting to abolish countries and nationality.

Workers have no country. We cannot take from them what they don't have. Since the wage-dependent class must first acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself as the nation, it is national, though not in the wealthy elite sense.

National differences and antagonisms between peoples are increasingly vanishing with the development of the wealthy elite, freedom of commerce, the world market, and the uniformity in the mode of production and corresponding conditions of life.

The supremacy of the wage-dependent class will cause them to vanish even faster. United action among leading civilized countries is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the wage-dependent class.

As the exploitation of one individual by another ends, so too will the exploitation of one nation by another. When class antagonism within nations disappears, the hostility between nations will also cease.

The criticisms against collective ownership made from religious, philosophical, and ideological standpoints don't deserve serious examination.

Does it require deep insight to understand that human ideas, views, and conceptions change with every change in the conditions of human existence, social relations, and social life?

What does the history of ideas prove except that intellectual production changes with material production? The dominant ideas of any age have always been the ideas of its ruling class.

When people speak of ideas that revolutionize society, they merely express the fact that within the old society, the elements of a new one have developed, and that the dissolution of old ideas keeps pace with the dissolution of old conditions.

When the ancient world was dying, ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed to rationalist ideas in the 18th century, feudal society fought its death battle with the revolutionary wealthy elite. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely reflected the rule of free competition in the realm of knowledge.

"Undoubtedly," some will say, "religious, moral, philosophical, and legal ideas have changed throughout historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, and law have always survived these changes."

"There are also eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., common to all social conditions. But collective ownership abolishes eternal truths, abolishes all religion and morality, instead of reshaping them. It therefore contradicts all past historical experience."

What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has been the development of class antagonisms—antagonisms that took different forms in different epochs.

But whatever form they took, one fact is common to all past ages: the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all variety and differences, moves within certain common forms—forms of consciousness that will completely dissolve only with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.

The collective ownership revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.

But let's move on from the wealthy elite's objections to collective ownership.

We have seen that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the wage-dependent class to the position of ruling class—to win the battle for democracy.

The wage-dependent class will use its political supremacy to gradually take all capital from the wealthy elite, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State (i.e., the wage-dependent class organized as the ruling class), and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.

Of course, this cannot be done immediately except by means of despotic interference with property rights and wealthy elite production relations—by measures that seem economically insufficient and untenable, but which become unavoidable as means of revolutionizing the entire mode of production.

These measures will naturally differ in different countries. However, in most advanced countries, the following will generally apply:

1. Abolition of property in land and application of all land rents to public purposes.
2. A heavy progressive income tax.
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, through a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.
6. Centralization of transportation and communication in the hands of the state.
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state; bringing fallow lands into cultivation and improving soil quality according to a common plan.
8. Equal obligation to work for all. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
9. Combining agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual elimination of the distinction between town and country through a more equitable distribution of the population.
10. Free education for all children in public schools. Elimination of child factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, etc.

When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the hands of the whole community, public power will lose its political character. Political power is merely the organized power of one class oppressing another. If the wage-dependent class, in fighting the wealthy elite, necessarily unites as a class, makes itself the ruling class through revolution, and as the ruling class forcibly sweeps away the old conditions of production, then along with these conditions it will eliminate class antagonisms and classes generally, and will thereby abolish its own supremacy as a class.

In place of the old wealthy elite society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

## A Note on Marx's Masterpiece: What Time Has Taught Us

Ever had that moment when your company announces "streamlining operations to maximize shareholder value" and suddenly half your coworkers are clearing out their desks? Or noticed how your phone is designed to break just after the warranty expires? Or maybe you've watched as your neighborhood's mom-and-pop shops get replaced by chain stores that somehow all pay minimum wage while their CEOs buy second yachts?

That's the ghost of Marx nodding in vindication. The man called these shots like a sports commentator who could see 175 years into the future.

Marx nailed the diagnosis so precisely it's almost uncomfortable. When your boss talks about the "unfortunate necessity" of outsourcing your department while announcing record quarterly profits, you're watching Marx's analysis play out in real time. When algorithms track your bathroom breaks at the warehouse, you're experiencing exactly the dehumanization he described. His predictions about wealth concentration, worker alienation, and global markets steamrolling national boundaries weren't wild guesses—they were mathematical certainties he spotted before anyone else.

But here's where things get complicated—and where we can learn something vital from history's experiments with his solutions.

## When the Cure Became Another Disease

The problem wasn't that Marx was wrong about capitalism's contradictions. The problem was that his prescription didn't account for something fundamental about human nature.

Remember how you felt when your roommate used your car without asking? Or when someone took credit for your idea at work? That's not just "bourgeois conditioning"—it's something deeper. Ownership isn't just some artificial concept we can educate away. It's wired into us at a level that's hard to reprogram.

When revolutionary movements tried eliminating private property entirely, they created a power vacuum that practically begged for authoritarian takeover. Without the diffusion of power that comes from distributed ownership, control centralized faster than you can say "new boss, worse than the old boss." Workers who thought they were getting liberation found themselves with different masters but similar chains—and often much worse conditions.

It's like if your entire apartment building decided that "private bedrooms" were bourgeois and had to be abolished. Suddenly your most intimate space is subject to committee decisions. The idea might sound equal on paper, but in practice, the guy who speaks loudest at building meetings is somehow always sleeping in the room with the best view.

## Finding the Third Path

The thing is, unfettered capitalism absolutely produces the exploitation Marx described. You don't need economic theory to see it—just look at your paycheck compared to your productivity, or your rent compared to your landlord's mortgage. But completely abolishing private property created equally devastating power imbalances. Different roads, same destination: concentrated power and widespread suffering.

Most of us intuitively understand this. We want decent wages, affordable healthcare, and housing that doesn't consume half our income. We also want to choose our own careers, decide where to live, and own our personal effects without committee approval. These aren't contradictory desires—they're the foundation of a dignified life.

The path forward isn't choosing between unchecked capitalism or authoritarian control. It's building systems that democratize ownership rather than abolishing it, that regulate markets rather than eliminating them, and that balance our need for both individual agency and collective support.

This isn't compromising on principles—it's recognizing that human beings are complex creatures who need both personal autonomy and collective security to thrive. Any system that ignores either part of this equation will eventually fail, no matter how perfect it looks on paper.

Countries that have found this balance—like the Nordics with their social democracies—consistently rank highest in both economic security and personal freedom. Not because they found some perfect midpoint between capitalism and communism, but because they built pragmatic systems that respect the full scope of human needs and motivations.

Marx was right that a system built primarily on extraction and exploitation will eventually collapse under its contradictions. He was wrong that the solution required abolishing the concept of ownership itself. We can—and must—do better than either extreme.

Later in this book, we'll explore exactly how everyday people are already building these alternatives—not through grand revolutions, but through thousands of smaller acts of resistance and creation that are quietly constructing a more humane economic system. Not because they've read Marx, but because they're tired of being exploited and have decided to do something about it.
