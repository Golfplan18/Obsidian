# The Patriot's Paradox

## When Violence Changes Its Name

You've seen it play out on your TV screen a hundred times. When protesters you don't agree with take to the streets, the chyron at the bottom reads "CHAOS ERUPTS AS RIOTERS CLASH WITH POLICE." But when protesters you sympathize with do essentially the same thing, suddenly the caption changes to "PATRIOTS DEFEND FREEDOM AS CONCERNED CITIZENS EXERCISE RIGHTS."

Same actions, different labels.

Remember the Michigan state capitol in 2020? Armed men with tactical gear and semi-automatic rifles stormed the building to protest COVID restrictions. News anchors called them "protesters" and "demonstrators." Politicians defended their right to be heard. A few weeks later, largely unarmed racial justice protesters were labeled "violent anarchists" and "thugs" for standing outside federal buildings.

This switcheroo isn't just linguistic gymnastics—it's the operating system of American power politics. It determines who gets treated with respect and who gets tear gas, who gets called a patriot and who gets called a terrorist.

Think about how your own neighborhood is policed. Some communities see officers as protection services—they respond quickly, treat residents with respect, and use minimal force. Other neighborhoods experience something closer to military occupation—aggressive stops, excessive force, and armored vehicles rolling down residential streets.

Same government, same Constitution, dramatically different experience depending on who you are and where you live.

## The Three-Step Costume Change

Watching the news transform the same behavior from "dangerous extremism" to "patriotic dissent" is like witnessing a quick-change magic act. The transformation happens so fast you might miss how it works.

Step 1: Identify who's doing it. Conservative-aligned groups get the hero treatment. Groups challenging existing power structures get the villain edit.

Step 2: Apply the appropriate language package. If it's the hero package, get ready for terms like "freedom fighter," "patriot," "concerned citizen," "defender of liberty." If it's the villain package, prepare for "thug," "rioter," "extremist," "radical," and "threat to public safety."

Step 3: Apply historical context selectively. Heroes get compared to the Founding Fathers and the American Revolution. Villains get lectures about the importance of "law and order" and "respecting property."

This three-step makeover determines how millions of Americans perceive identical actions. It's why a group occupying federal land in Oregon with assault rifles gets described as "taking a stand for liberty" while unarmed water protectors at Standing Rock get labeled as "dangerous extremists" requiring military-style response.

We've all watched this play out so many times that we barely notice the manipulation anymore. But once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it.

## The Wink and Nod System

"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?"

Those words, supposedly uttered by King Henry II, led to the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in 1170. The king never explicitly ordered the killing, but his knights got the message anyway.

That medieval lesson in plausible deniability could be the playbook for modern conservative leadership. They've perfected the art of inciting violence while maintaining perfect innocence when it erupts.

The formula works like this:

1. Describe political opponents as existential threats to everything your followers hold dear. They're not just wrong—they're destroying America, attacking families, and threatening way of life.
    
2. Repeatedly insist that normal democratic processes have failed. The system is rigged. Elections are stolen. Courts are corrupt. The media lies.
    
3. Glorify historical examples of violent resistance. Celebrate revolutionaries with guns while downplaying those who used nonviolence.
    
4. When violence inevitably occurs, express mild concern while emphasizing that people feel "unheard" and "frustrated."
    
5. Act shocked—shocked!—that anyone would connect your rhetoric to the resulting violence.

We saw this play out in real time before January 6th. For months, millions heard that the election was being "stolen" through fraud. They were told this was an existential crisis requiring extraordinary measures. Then, after the Capitol attack, the same voices that fed that narrative expressed surprise at the outcome while carefully avoiding responsibility.

It's a bit like someone spending months telling their friends that their neighbor is secretly poisoning the neighborhood dogs, then acting surprised when someone burns down the neighbor's house.

## Who Gets to Use Force

The government claims a monopoly on legitimate violence—meaning only officials like police and military can legally use force. That sounds reasonable until you notice how selectively this principle gets applied.

A white homeowner shoots an intruder: "Stand your ground." A Black homeowner shoots an intruder: "Let's look at all the complicated factors here..."

Armed militia patrolling the border: "Concerned citizens." Armed group patrolling their own neighborhood: "Dangerous gang activity."

Police using military tactics against environmental protesters: "Necessary for public safety." Police using kid gloves with armed anti-government demonstrators: "Respecting constitutional rights."

Malcolm X cut through this hypocrisy when he pointed out that in places "where the government has proven its...either its inability or its unwillingness to protect the lives and property of our people, then it's only fair to expect us to do whatever is necessary to protect ourselves."

This selective application creates a bizarre contradiction in conservative thinking. They simultaneously fear government tyranny enough to stockpile weapons while trusting that same government with nearly unlimited power to police, surveil, and control others. They want government small enough to drown in a bathtub, except for the parts with guns and badges—those can be as large as possible.

## The Messy Truth About Change

Here's a history lesson they don't teach in school: significant social progress rarely comes from politely asking powerful people to stop exploiting their advantage.

The American Revolution wasn't won with strongly worded letters. Labor rights weren't secured through cordial boardroom discussions. Civil rights weren't obtained by asking nicely. In each case, disruptive action—sometimes including violence or its credible threat—played a crucial role in forcing change.

Yet our sanitized history books present a version where progress happens through lone heroes giving inspirational speeches followed by the immediate conversion of opponents who suddenly see the light. That's not how it worked then, and it's not how it works now.

Malcolm X highlighted this historical reality when he pointed out: "If George Washington didn't get independence in this country non-violently, and if Patrick Henry didn't come up with a non-violent statement, and you taught me to look on them as patriots and heroes, then it is time for you to realize that I have studied your books well."

The American mythology celebrates the revolutionary violence of 1776 while demanding that today's movements for justice remain perfectly peaceful regardless of what violence is directed against them. It's a double standard that serves existing power structures by making resistance seem both illegitimate and futile.

As someone who experienced this hypocrisy firsthand, Malcolm X put it bluntly: "I don't go along with any kind of nonviolence unless everybody's going to be nonviolent. If they make the Ku Klux Klan nonviolent, I'll be nonviolent. If they make the White Citizens' Council nonviolent, I'll be nonviolent. But as long as you've got somebody else not being nonviolent, I don't want anybody coming to me talking any kind of nonviolent talk."

## When Law and Order Breaks Down

The fundamental weakness in the conservative "law and order" position is its failure to recognize that order without justice is inherently unstable. You can't maintain peace while systematically denying people their basic needs and rights.

Hurricane Katrina exposed this reality in stark terms. When the government abandoned New Orleans residents, particularly in poorer neighborhoods, people didn't just passively accept their fate. They formed protective groups to secure supplies and defend their families—exactly like the wagon trains conservatives mythologize from frontier days.

When the state fails in its basic responsibilities, people organize to protect themselves. That's not lawlessness—it's human nature. Anyone who has lived through natural disasters or civil unrest knows this instinctively. When official systems collapse, informal ones emerge.

The conservative fantasy is a world where they can have unchallenged authority to use force while others remain perfectly nonviolent regardless of circumstances. Where their armed demonstrations are legitimate political expression while others' are dangerous threats requiring swift suppression.

This one-sided arrangement is fundamentally unsustainable. It creates the very instability it claims to prevent.

## When Your Weapons Change Hands

The most dangerous aspect of normalizing extraordinary powers and selective enforcement is forgetting a fundamental political reality: power changes hands.

When conservatives cheer on aggressive police tactics against racial justice protesters, they're building machinery that can be turned against their own causes later. When they undermine legal protections for some groups, they eliminate shields that have historically protected their own movements too.

The aftermath of January 6th revealed this blind spot in vivid detail. Suddenly, conservatives who had demanded harsh crackdowns on previous protesters were shocked to face similar treatment themselves. The same people who celebrated surveillance powers, aggressive prosecution, and guilt by association were outraged when those tools were deployed against right-wing activists.

"This is political persecution!" they cried, apparently forgetting they'd spent years demanding exactly this approach for others.

This blindness to eventual reciprocity is perhaps the greatest strategic error of the conservative movement. By normalizing state violence against their opponents, they've built the very cage they may one day find themselves locked inside.

## Building Something Better

Let's be crystal clear: This isn't advocating violence. It's recognizing reality. When democratic channels for addressing grievances are systematically closed, when state violence goes unchecked, and when basic human needs remain unmet, conflict becomes inevitable. That's not a threat—it's a pattern observed throughout human history.

Our challenge isn't choosing between violence and nonviolence. It's creating systems where everyone's needs and rights are respected so that violence becomes unnecessary.

Malcolm X himself advocated for Black Americans to become politically educated and engaged, believing in using "ballots or bullets" to achieve freedom—with a clear preference for ballots if they could bring about meaningful change.

This is the wisdom we must embrace. We need to create and protect democratic systems that actually address grievances and deliver justice. We must reject the selective celebration of force that characterizes conservative rhetoric. We need to establish a consistent standard where power protects all citizens equally, not just those aligned with dominant interests.

As progressives, our task isn't to match conservative hypocrisy with our own, but to expose it while building genuine alternatives. We need to offer a vision where true security comes not from force but from communities where everyone's basic needs are met, where justice is applied equally, and where democracy functions for all citizens, not just the powerful few.

Only then can we break the cycle where violence becomes the inevitable response to systematic injustice. Only then can we build a society where "patriotism" means working toward justice for all, not just defending the privileges of some.
