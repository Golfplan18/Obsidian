# Populism's False Promises

## The Factory That Never Came Back

"They're bringing back the jobs," Dan tells me, gesturing toward the abandoned factory that's been sitting empty for eight years in his small Ohio town. "That's what they promised, and I believe them." Dan's wearing a hat supporting the same politician who's been making this promise through three election cycles now. The factory remains empty, weeds growing through the parking lot cracks. His town's population has declined another 15% since those promises began.

A mile away, the Dollar General that replaced the locally-owned hardware store is the only place left to buy groceries since the supermarket closed. The hospital just eliminated its maternity ward – expectant mothers now drive 67 miles to deliver. The opioid treatment center that briefly opened has shuttered due to funding cuts supported by the same politicians promising to revitalize the town.

Yet Dan remains certain that the coastal elites, immigrants, and socialists are to blame for his community's decline – not the corporate executives who shuttered the factory while receiving multi-million dollar bonuses, or the politicians who cut taxes for those executives while slashing the public services his town relies on.

This isn't a story about Dan being gullible. It's about the most successful con job in American political history – one where the very people emptying these towns have convinced their victims to thank them for it, vote for them because of it, and blame anyone but them for the results.

## The Champion Switcheroo

The moment your neighborhood starts getting too expensive to live in, and the real estate developer who's driving up costs shows up at the community meeting wearing work boots and a Carhartt jacket, talking about how "we need to protect regular folks from these outsiders"—that's conservative populism in action.

It happens everywhere. The corporation polluting your water supply sponsors a "community appreciation day." The hedge fund manager who bought and gutted your town's main employer writes op-eds about the "forgotten Americans." The billionaire who's never worked a day in his life somehow becomes the voice of the working class.

We're watching a magic trick so stunning it deserves a standing ovation: the economic elites who benefit most from the current system have rebranded themselves as the champions fighting against it.

Consider what happened in 2017, when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It was sold as relief for "hardworking Americans," but the numbers tell a different story. The richest 1% received 83% of the benefits, while the cuts for middle-class families were designed to expire after a few years. Corporate tax rates were permanently slashed from 35% to 21%, while most individuals saw temporary savings of less than $20 per week.

The architects of this $1.9 trillion upward wealth transfer then used the resulting deficit to argue that Social Security and Medicare—programs working people actually rely on—were "unaffordable" and needed cutting.

Yet the politicians who engineered this massive wealth grab weren't labeled as enemies of the working class. Instead, they campaigned as its defenders. And it worked.

This isn't just hypocrisy—it's economic jujitsu. The very folks who should be the targets of populist rage have repositioned themselves as its champions, redirecting that anger toward immigrants, minorities, and "liberal elites" who have far less power over working Americans' economic lives than the corporate boardrooms making the actual decisions.

## The Look Over There Technique

Ever had a friend who, whenever they're caught doing something wrong, immediately changes the subject to something completely unrelated? That's essentially how conservative media functions every day of the week.

Pay attention and you'll see the pattern:

1. Working-class wages stagnate for decades? Look at transgender athletes!
2. Healthcare costs crushing families? Focus on border caravans!
3. Housing becoming unaffordable? Get angry about critical race theory!
4. Corporations paying zero taxes? Let's debate Confederate statues!

This redirection happens so consistently it can't possibly be coincidence. It's strategy—and an effective one at that.

When wages stay flat while CEO pay skyrockets, people naturally get angry. That anger needs somewhere to go. If it's directed at the actual causes—corporate consolidation, weakened labor laws, tax policies that encourage offshoring—it might threaten the donor class. But if it can be channeled toward other targets who have virtually no impact on economic policy, the system can continue extracting wealth upward without interruption.

This misdirection machine runs 24/7 across right-wing media. Watch Fox News for a week and count how many segments address the actual economic forces determining viewers' financial futures versus how many focus on cultural grievances. The ratio is no accident.

The genius of this system is how it turns potential allies against each other. Think about Maria and John, both working two jobs to make ends meet. Maria lives in a city and is Puerto Rican; John lives in a rural area and is white. Both are struggling with healthcare costs, housing prices, and stagnant wages. Both are being crushed by the same economic forces.

Logically, they should be allies demanding changes that would help them both. But the misdirection machine ensures they see each other as enemies instead. John believes Maria's community gets "handouts" while his gets nothing (untrue). Maria believes John votes against his interests out of pure bigotry (also usually untrue). Neither recognizes how perfectly this division serves the very powers extracting wealth from both of them.

## The Harvard Man of the People

"I'm an outsider fighting the elites," declares the Princeton-educated senator whose campaign is funded by billionaires. He adjusts the carefully rumpled flannel shirt he wore for this factory visit—a wardrobe choice his image consultant recommended to seem "more authentic."

The senator has never worked in a factory, never worried about making rent, never had to choose between medicine and food. Yet he's built his entire brand around being the voice of the "forgotten Americans."

This isn't unusual. It's the standard model.

Ted Cruz presents himself as a Washington outsider fighting the establishment—after attending Princeton and Harvard Law, working in the Bush administration, and marrying a Goldman Sachs executive.

Josh Hawley positions himself as the champion against elites—after attending Stanford and Yale Law, clerking for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and working as a law professor.

J.D. Vance transformed from a venture capitalist backed by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel into the voice of the working class—while still taking that Silicon Valley money.

Each follows the same formula: acquire elite credentials, secure elite backing, then rebrand as an anti-elite crusader railing against the very system that produced them.

The cognitive dissonance should be crippling. Conservative voters who would instinctively distrust these same credentials in any other context—"What does some Harvard lawyer know about my life?"—somehow embrace them in their political champions, as long as those champions perform the right kind of resentment toward the institutions that educated them.

It's the political equivalent of a trust fund kid playing dress-up as a working-class hero—all while cashing the checks that fund their elite lifestyle.

## Following the Anti-Establishment Money Trail

Let's play "follow the money." When an organization claims to be "fighting the establishment," the first question should be: who funds it?

Take the Tea Party, which portrayed itself as a grassroots uprising against the political establishment. In reality, it was heavily funded and shaped by Americans for Prosperity—an organization backed by the billionaire Koch brothers—and FreedomWorks, another corporate-funded entity.

These corporate-backed groups used anti-establishment rhetoric to advance policies benefiting their funders: tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation for polluting industries, and opposition to healthcare reform that might affect pharmaceutical profits.

This isn't conspiracy theory; it's simply how the system works. Corporate interests have learned that the best defense against populist anger is to fund and direct that anger themselves, ensuring it never targets their interests.

The corporate-populist pipeline operates like this:

1. Corporate donors fund populist organizations, think tanks, and media
2. These groups redirect popular anger toward cultural issues and powerless scapegoats
3. Populist energy gets channeled toward electing corporate-friendly politicians
4. These politicians implement policies benefiting their donors, not their voters
5. When these policies fail to improve voters' lives, the cycle renews with fresh scapegoats

It's a perpetual motion machine of misdirected outrage. Corporate money ensures populist energy never threatens actual concentrations of wealth and power, instead keeping it safely focused on targets that don't threaten the economic status quo.

This explains why conservative populism so consistently focuses on cultural grievances while avoiding economic ones. Cultural battles over pronouns, holiday greetings, or statue removals rarely threaten elite financial interests. But populist energy directed toward breaking up monopolies, taxing wealth, or strengthening labor? That's the nightmare scenario for corporate funders.

## The Ghost of Teddy Roosevelt

The conservative establishment's vigilance against genuine economic populism makes perfect sense when you remember what happened the last time they lost control of it.

Theodore Roosevelt—a Republican—broke up Standard Oil, regulated the railroads, established food and drug safety laws, and created the national park system. Called a "traitor to his class," he directed populist energy toward its logical targets: monopoly power, corruption, and economic exploitation.

This is the scenario that haunts elite conservative nightmares: a figure who might harness populist energy against its natural targets—concentrated economic power and the political structures that enable it.

The safeguards against another Roosevelt are robust. Any genuinely anti-corporate, anti-monopoly voice within conservative politics gets systematically marginalized, denied funding, attacked by right-wing media, and excluded from power. The conservative movement's immune response to actual economic populism is ruthlessly efficient.

Take Justin Amash, who criticized corporate welfare and military-industrial complex spending while in Congress. Despite his conservative credentials, he was quickly isolated and eventually forced out of the Republican Party. Or consider how quickly the conservative media apparatus mobilized against any Republican who suggested even modest tax increases on the wealthy.

These aren't random responses—they're a system protecting itself. Cultural populism is encouraged because it rarely threatens financial interests. Economic populism is crushed because it might.

## The Survival Kit Business Model

"The deep state doesn't want you to know what's coming!"

That's how the email begins—the one selling overpriced gold coins, survival gear, or nutritional supplements to the same audience that just watched a segment about government corruption.

This isn't just a political strategy; it's a business model. Conservative populism has perfected the art of monetizing the very anxiety it creates. The formula works like this:

1. Convince people they're under attack from powerful, shadowy forces
2. Position yourself as their champion against these forces
3. Explain that fighting these forces requires financial support
4. Use that money to enrich yourself while doing nothing to address actual problems
5. When problems worsen, blame the shadowy forces and request more money

This grift extends far beyond campaign contributions to include:

- Merchandise with patriotic branding sold at massive markups
- Gold coins marketed during manufactured financial crises
- Survivalist gear priced at multiples of its actual value
- "Alternative" health products targeting the politically alienated
- Subscription "news" services promising to reveal "what they don't want you to know"
- Endless fundraising for organizations that primarily pay their own executives

This ecosystem mirrors the prosperity gospel in religious broadcasting—where followers send money to millionaire preachers who promise that donations will bring blessings while they fly private jets and live in mansions.

What makes this particularly insidious is how it monetizes legitimate economic anxiety. People really are struggling; their communities really are declining. Rather than addressing the causes, this system treats those struggles as profit opportunities. It's a political equivalent of a doctor who worsens your illness to sell you more treatments.

## Real Communities, Real Consequences

Drive through McDowell County, West Virginia, and you'll see the human consequences of populism's false promises. Once a thriving coal mining area, it's now one of America's poorest counties, with declining population, shuttered businesses, and life expectancy comparable to some developing countries.

Yet McDowell County votes overwhelmingly for the very politicians who block black lung benefits for former miners, oppose expanded healthcare access, cut mine safety regulations, and protect the coal company executives who abandoned their pension obligations.

When the COVID pandemic hit, these same politicians fought against relief measures that would have helped McDowell County residents. They followed up by opposing infrastructure investments that might have created jobs in the region. And when the opioid epidemic devastated communities like McDowell, they protected the pharmaceutical executives responsible while blaming the victims.

The pattern repeats across rural America. The areas most fervently supporting populist politicians experience the worst outcomes from those politicians' policies: more hospital closures, more job losses, more deaths of despair, more economic decline.

Perhaps the most striking example comes from the manufacturing promises. For decades, populist politicians have promised to "bring back" manufacturing jobs while simultaneously supporting tax policies that incentivize offshoring, opposing labor protections that would make those jobs worth having, and blocking infrastructure investments that might create new industries.

Their voters keep waiting for factories that never reopen. Meanwhile, the executives who closed those factories enjoy tax cuts and deregulation from the same politicians promising to challenge them.

The cruel irony is how often these communities double down on the very politicians failing them. Rather than recognizing the con, they accept explanations blaming immigrants, government regulations, or cultural elites for problems directly caused by the policies they voted for.

## Breaking the Cycle

Understanding conservative populism's mechanics doesn't automatically break its spell. The system works partly because it addresses real grievances, even if it misdirects the blame and profits from false solutions.

Working Americans really have been economically squeezed for decades. Rural communities really are struggling. The political system really does seem unresponsive to ordinary people's needs. These realities provide the fertile soil in which false populism grows.

Breaking the cycle requires more than just pointing out the contradictions. It means offering an authentic alternative that addresses legitimate grievances without the misdirection and exploitation. It requires creating a populism that actually challenges concentrated economic power rather than protecting it.

This is where progressives have often failed. Too frequently, we've dismissed populist energy as simply bigotry or ignorance rather than recognizing the legitimate economic anxiety being exploited. We've allowed the right to monopolize the language of "the people versus the powerful" while we've sounded like defenders of a status quo that isn't working for most Americans.

If we want to break the cycle of false populism, we need to reclaim economic populism—to make it clear that the real division in American society isn't between urban and rural, white and non-white, but between those who profit from an extractive economy and those who are extracted from.

We need to speak directly to the economic reality of working Americans without the cultural misdirection. We need to name the actual forces destroying communities—monopolization, financialization, wealth concentration—rather than scapegoating the powerless. And we need to offer solutions that actually address these problems rather than enriching those who exploit them.

The volatility of populist energy presents both danger and opportunity. Misdirected, it serves as a powerful tool for maintaining an unjust status quo. Properly directed, it could become the force that finally challenges the concentrated economic power strangling American democracy.

The question is whether we can break through the misdirection machine to help people recognize their true economic interests—and their true economic adversaries.
