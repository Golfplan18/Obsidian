# Creating Effective Scene Prompts: A Comprehensive Framework

I'm excited to help you develop a robust framework for crafting prompts that will generate high-quality, consistent scenes. Your goal of building a systematic approach with spreadsheets is excellentâ€”it will give you precise control while maintaining consistency across your project.

## Understanding AI Scene Generation: The Foundation

When I generate a scene based on your prompt, I'm essentially performing several cognitive tasks simultaneously:

1. **Interpreting the scene's purpose** within the larger narrative
2. **Embodying each character's voice and perspective** authentically
3. **Managing the dramatic tension** and pacing of the interaction
4. **Advancing plot elements** while maintaining consistency
5. **Creating dialogue that feels natural** yet serves narrative purposes

The quality of my output depends on how clearly your prompt communicates these elements. Let me outline a comprehensive framework for what information proves most useful.

## Core Elements for Effective Scene Prompts

### 1. Scene Framework

- **Scene Title/Identifier**: A unique reference point for tracking
- **Scene Goal**: What must be accomplished dramatically (reveal information, escalate conflict, change relationship dynamic)
- **Scene Timing**: Where this fits in the overall narrative arc
- **Entry Point**: The specific situation/moment where scene begins
- **Exit Point**: The specific situation/moment where scene must end
- **Dramatic Question**: The underlying tension driving the scene

[[Library/Engrams/We Too/Scene Framework Structural Foundations for Narrative Architecture\|Scene Framework Structural Foundations for Narrative Architecture]]
### 2. Setting Elements

- **Physical Location**: Where characters are interacting
- **Time Elements**: Time of day, duration constraints, timestamp in story
- **Atmosphere**: Sensory details that establish mood (lighting, sounds, temperature)
- **Contextual Elements**: Objects/environmental factors that influence interaction
- **Privacy Level**: Who else might overhear/intervene (public vs. private space)

[[Library/Engrams/We Too/The Narrative Resonance of Setting Environment as Character\|The Narrative Resonance of Setting Environment as Character]]

### 3. Character Dynamics

- **Present Characters**: Who's in the scene (primary and background)
- **Character States**: Each character's mental/emotional condition entering the scene
- **Power Dynamics**: Current relational positioning (who has leverage/vulnerability)
- **Knowledge Asymmetry**: What each character knows that others don't
- **Hidden Agendas**: Private goals separate from stated intentions

[[Library/Engrams/We Too/Character Dynamics The Living Architecture of Narrative\|Character Dynamics The Living Architecture of Narrative]]
### 4. Dialogue Direction

- **Speech Patterns**: Key linguistic markers for each character
- **Subtext Guidelines**: What remains unspoken but implied
- **Conversational Flow**: How dialogue should progress (confrontational, evasive, etc.)
- **Key Lines**: Any specific dialogue that must be included
- **Forbidden Topics**: Subjects characters would deliberately avoid

[[Library/Engrams/We Too/Dialogue Direction The Architecture of Character Voice\|Dialogue Direction The Architecture of Character Voice]]
### 5. Narrative Function

- **Revelations**: New information that must emerge
- **Foreshadowing Elements**: Seeds planted for future developments
- **Character Development**: How personalities evolve through this interaction
- **Thematic Reinforcement**: Which core themes this scene emphasizes
- **Plot Advancement**: Specific story elements that must move forward

[[Library/Engrams/We Too/Narrative Function The Purposeful Architecture of Story Elements\|Narrative Function The Purposeful Architecture of Story Elements]]
## How I Process This Information

When you provide this information, I'm essentially creating a mental simulation where I:

1. **Position characters within the specified environment**
2. **Embody each character's psychological state**
3. **Navigate from entry point to exit point** while:
    - Maintaining authentic character voices
    - Revealing necessary information
    - Building appropriate tension
    - Creating natural dialogue patterns
    - Achieving the scene's goal

The more specific your guidance in each category, the more precisely I can execute your vision. However, leaving certain elements intentionally open allows creative exploration within established parameters.

## Developing Your Template: A Practical Approach

Based on your Scrivener materials and our discussion, here's a structured template you could implement in your spreadsheet:

### SCENE HEADER

```
Scene ID: [Unique identifier]
Timeline Position: [When this occurs in story]
Previous Scene: [What just happened]
Next Scene: [What happens after]
Primary Purpose: [Core narrative function]
```

[[Library/Engrams/We Too/The Dialogic Template Co-Creative Architecture for Narrative Development\|The Dialogic Template Co-Creative Architecture for Narrative Development]]

### DRAMATIC STRUCTURE

```
Entry State: [Precise starting situation]
Tension Driver: [Central conflict/question]
Key Turning Point: [Moment where dynamic shifts]
Resolution Type: [How tension resolves - open/closed/partial]
Exit State: [Precise ending situation]
```
[[Library/Engrams/We Too/The Precision Imperative Dramatic Structure as Narrative Navigation\|The Precision Imperative Dramatic Structure as Narrative Navigation]]
### SETTING DETAILS

```
Location: [Physical space]
Time Frame: [When & duration]
Atmospheric Elements: [Sensory details]
Key Objects: [Items that influence interaction]
Environmental Factors: [Weather, sounds, interruptions]
```
[[Library/Engrams/We Too/Setting as Character The Environmental Psychology of Narrative Space\|Setting as Character The Environmental Psychology of Narrative Space]]
### CHARACTER STATES

For each character present:

```
Character: [Name]
Current Emotional State: [Primary feeling]
Physical Condition: [Tired/alert/intoxicated/etc.]
Recent Context: [What just happened to them]
Primary Goal in Scene: [What they want]
Secondary/Hidden Goal: [What they really want]
Key Knowledge: [What they know others don't]
Psychological Vulnerabilities: [Current weak points]
Speech Pattern Reminders: [Linguistic markers]
```
[[Library/Engrams/We Too/Character States The Dynamic Psychology of Narrative Presence\|Character States The Dynamic Psychology of Narrative Presence]]
### DIALOGUE GUIDANCE

```
Opening Exchange: [How conversation begins]
Required Topics: [Must be discussed]
Forbidden Topics: [Must be avoided or deflected]
Subtext Elements: [Unspoken tensions]
Key Lines/Phrases: [Specific dialogue to include]
Conversation Evolution: [How tone/focus changes]
```

For your spreadsheet approach, consider:

1. **Master tabs for permanent elements** (character profiles, settings, overall plot)
2. **Scene-specific tabs** that pull relevant information from master tabs
3. **Dynamic fields** where changing a single parameter updates related elements

This creates a system where modifying "Authoritarian Stage" would automatically update character behaviors, dialogue patterns, and dramatic tensions throughout the related scenes.

For the poker night scenes specifically, you'll want to emphasize:

- The **contrast between public and private personas** for Phukher
- **Knowledge asymmetries** between characters (what Malcolm knows versus Buford)
- **Speech pattern variations** that reveal character psychology
- **Thematic reinforcement** of the authoritarian stage's key elements

## How Information Changes Output

To illustrate how different prompt elements affect my output, let me demonstrate with a simplified example:

### Basic Prompt:

"Write a poker night scene with Phukher and Malcolm discussing a recent policy."

This gives me minimal guidance, forcing me to make assumptions about:

- Their relationship dynamic
- The policy's nature and impact
- Current political context
- Each character's emotional state
- The scene's purpose

### Enhanced Prompt:

"Write a poker night scene where Phukher (smug after a political victory) defends a recent tax policy that benefits the wealthy while hurting his own supporters. Malcolm (frustrated but strategic) tries to expose the contradiction. Buford enthusiastically supports Phukher despite being personally harmed by the policy. Scene should reveal Phukher's awareness of the hypocrisy while maintaining his public justification."

This provides crucial context for:

- Character motivations and emotional states
- The specific tension to explore
- The dramatic irony to highlight
- The scene's thematic purpose

The difference in output quality would be substantial. The enhanced prompt enables me to create dialogue that serves multiple narrative functions simultaneously while maintaining authentic character voices.
