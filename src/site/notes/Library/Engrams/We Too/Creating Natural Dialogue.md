# Creating Natural Dialogue

Natural dialogue serves multiple functions simultaneously:

1. **Reveals character** through word choice, rhythm, and topic selection
2. **Advances plot** by sharing information or creating conflict
3. **Establishes relationships** through power dynamics and intimacy
4. **Creates subtext** through what remains unsaid

For your project, you've already created robust character profiles that define their speech patterns. The key is ensuring their dialogue:

- **Maintains consistency** with established speech patterns
- **Reflects their current emotional state**
- **Serves the scene's dramatic purpose**
- **Contains appropriate subtext** based on what they know/want
