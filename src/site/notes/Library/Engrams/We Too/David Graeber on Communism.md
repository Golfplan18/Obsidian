# David Graeber on Communism
David Graeber held nuanced views on communism, distinguishing it from state-controlled regimes and identifying its principles in everyday social interactions. Here's a summary of his perspective based on the provided sources:

- **Distinction from Soviet-style socialism:** Graeber argued that the term "communism" has been widely misunderstood and associated with the top-down, state-controlled economies of the Soviet bloc and China. He pointed out that those who organized these systems referred to them as "socialism," while viewing communism as a **utopian, truly free, stateless society** that would exist in the future.
- **"Communism" as a principle of human relations:** Graeber defined "communism" as **any human relationship that operates on the principles of "from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs"**. He suggested that this "communism" is not just a theoretical ideal but a principle that is already at play in various aspects of social life.
- **Everyday "communism":** He insisted that people already act as "communists" in their daily interactions, particularly with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers, based on the understanding that others would reciprocate according to their abilities and needs. He noted that in these social obligations, what is equal is the knowledge that the other person would do the same for you, not necessarily a direct or immediate monetary balance.
- **Relationship with capitalism:** Graeber did not see these "communist" relations as being entirely separate from or necessarily in direct opposition to capitalism. Instead, he suggested that the "specter of communism might lurk not only within families and friendships but within the very organization of corporate capitalism itself," in situations where people are united in a common task and organized by capacities and requirements rather than strict accounting. He even hinted that the experience of work within capitalist enterprises might often contradict the moral basis of the wage labor contract, suggesting underlying "communist" principles.
- **Mutual reinforcement with individualism:** Drawing on Marcel Mauss, Graeber believed that **individualism and communism are not necessarily contradictory but can be mutually reinforcing of each other and always present in societies at some level**.
- **Potential for alternative social organization:** Graeber held that **alternative, non-oppressive modes of social organization were possible** and could be found within our own lifeworlds, hinting at the potential for a broader realization of "communist" principles. He questioned what forms of organization and technology might emerge if free people were able to use their imagination to solve collective problems without relying on physical threats for enforcement.
- **Influence of Mauss:** Graeber's understanding of communism was significantly shaped by the work of Marcel Mauss, who viewed it as a matter of **dispositions and practices rather than solely property rights**. Mauss's work on the gift, which emphasizes reciprocal obligations and social bonds, resonated with Graeber's broader conception of "communism" in everyday life.
- **Critique of revolutionary approaches:** While an anarchist, Graeber was critical of forced approaches to establishing socialism, as seen in his reservations about the Bolshevik revolution. He favored a vision of socialism and, by extension, a more "communist" society that would emerge from grassroots efforts and cooperation.

In essence, Graeber offered a multifaceted view of communism, recognizing its utopian aspirations while also identifying its core principles as already embedded in everyday human interactions and holding the potential for broader social and economic reorganization.
