# David Graeber on Debt, Authoritarianism and Hierarchy
Drawing on the sources and our conversation history, here is a summary of David Graeber's views on debt and how it's used to reinforce authoritarian rule and a hierarchical society:

**Debt as a Foundation for Power and Control:**

- Graeber argued that **debt is a powerful and flexible concept that has been used throughout history to justify relations founded on violence and to make such relations seem moral**. By framing interactions in terms of debt, it often appears as though the victim is the one in the wrong.
- He stated that for millennia, most human beings have been told they are debtors. This pervasive sense of indebtedness has historically caused significant outrage and resentment, often more so than simply being told they are inferior.
- Graeber defined debt in its simplest expression as **"a promise corrupted by both math and violence"**. This highlights his view that the enforcement of debt obligations is often backed by the threat or actual use of violence, particularly by the state.

**Debt and the Reinforcement of Hierarchies:**

- Graeber's analysis reveals that in hierarchical societies, obligations are often enforced by social and cultural customs, with inferiors expected to make repeated material tribute to their superiors.
- He pointed out that in many historical instances, debt has been a key mechanism for creating and maintaining social stratification. For example, he described how in some societies, the landless and penniless were in a state of permanent debt dependency to landlords, sometimes even leading to the use of borrowers' daughters as security for loans.
- Graeber noted a historical tendency for the struggle between rich and poor to take the form of conflicts between creditors and debtors, revolving around issues like interest, debt peonage, and repossession. Popular insurrections have frequently begun with the ritual destruction of debt records, indicating the central role of debt in systems of oppression.
- He argued that politically, telling people they are equals and then humiliating and degrading them through debt is a common dynamic. This can be more likely to inspire outrage and collective action than systems based on pure inequality.

**The Role of the State and Authoritarianism:**

- Graeber emphasized the role of **state violence** in the history of money and debt. He argued that money did not spontaneously emerge but was often linked to the state's need for resources and its ability to enforce obligations, including debts.
- The process of **criminalizing indebtedness** is a crucial aspect of how debt reinforces state power and hierarchy. This can range from historical capital penalties for defaulting on repayment to the contemporary criminalization of poverty.
- Graeber, through the lens of Zygmunt Bauman's concept of "velvet repression," suggested that in acquiring agency through money in a consumer society, individuals simultaneously become subjugated to state authority.
- He highlighted the modern form of intergenerational transmission of debt in the growing public debt, which he linked to the historical embodiment of debt in slavery, where future generations are also bound. In extreme scenarios, perpetual public debt could lead to a situation akin to a slave society where production is dedicated to debt repayment.

**Debt as a Tool of Exploitation:**

- Graeber argued that money can be seen as an acknowledgment of a debt that cannot be paid, sometimes reminiscent of "primordial-debt theory," which posits a debt to society. However, he critiqued the idea of a singular debt to "society," suggesting instead a network of dyadic relations of debt.
- He contended that debt simplifies complex human social relations, making them easier to manipulate for exploitation and violence. The formal, numerical nature of monetary debt, unlike the more flexible moral obligations in "communist" relations, allows for the seemingly legitimate use of state or market violence to enforce repayment.

In essence, Graeber viewed debt not merely as an economic tool but as a deeply social and political instrument that has been historically intertwined with violence, inequality, and the reinforcement of hierarchical power structures, often with the backing and enforcement mechanisms of the state.
