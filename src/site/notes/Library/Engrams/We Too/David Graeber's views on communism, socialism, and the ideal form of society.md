# David Graeber's Views on Communism, Socialism, and the Ideal Form of Society
Drawing on the sources and our previous conversation, here is a summary of David Graeber's views on communism, socialism, and the ideal form of society:

**Communism:**

- Graeber offered a **nuanced understanding of communism**, distinguishing it from the historical state-controlled regimes often labeled as such [previous turn]. He argued that these regimes were typically described by their organizers as **"socialism," with "communism" envisioned as a future, truly free, and stateless utopian society** [previous turn].
- His central concept of communism focused on it as a **fundamental principle of human relations**, defined as **"from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs"** [previous turn, 7]. He saw this not merely as a future ideal but as a **practice already embedded in everyday life** through mutual aid and social obligations within families, friendships, and communities [previous turn, 13, 81]. In these relationships, reciprocity is based on the understanding that others will help according to their capacity and needs, not necessarily on strict accounting [previous turn].
- Graeber suggested that these **"communist" interactions form a bedrock upon which even capitalist systems are built** [13, previous turn]. He even proposed that the "specter of communism might lurk...within the very organization of corporate capitalism itself" in instances of shared tasks organized by abilities and needs rather than strict exchange [previous turn, 81].
- He highlighted, following Marcel Mauss, that **individualism and communism are not inherently contradictory but can be mutually reinforcing** [58, previous turn, 76].
- Drawing inspiration from thinkers like **Peter Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid,"** Graeber's conception of communism aligns with a more decentralized, cooperative model rather than a state-imposed one [17, previous turn, 57]. He saw **anarchy as an ethical choice and a way of life** that could lead to a more just society.

**Socialism:**

- Graeber distinguished between **socialism and communism**, with socialism often representing more immediate political and economic goals, sometimes involving state intervention, while communism was a more far-reaching ideal [previous turn].
- He identified with a **"typical Libertarian Socialist position"**, suggesting a focus on freedom and decentralized control.
- While recognizing the historical significance of socialist movements and thinkers like **Karl Marx**, Graeber also offered critiques. He noted Marx's contempt for "utopian socialism," which involved creating blueprints for an ideal society. Graeber, while believing in the possibility of a different society, seemed to favor a more emergent approach rooted in existing cooperative practices [8, 81, previous turn].
- He was **critical of top-down, state-imposed socialism**, as evidenced by his reservations about the Bolshevik revolution, which he viewed as potentially oxymoronic in its forced implementation and marked by utilitarianism and a disregard for democratic institutions [71, 78, previous turn]. Instead, he favored socialism built "from the bottom up, through cooperativization and union action".
- Graeber acknowledged that socialist thought, including Marxism, often aims to understand how systems reproduce exploitation, a crucial insight he recognized.

**Ideal Form of Society:**

- Graeber's ideal form of society aligns with **anarchist principles**, emphasizing **freedom, self-management, mutual respect, and a rejection of coercive authority and repressive systems**. He believed in the possibility of **alternative, non-oppressive modes of social organization** that could be found within our current social interactions.
- A key element of his vision was **faith in human possibilities** and the capacity to build a more just society. He echoed the sentiment that "the ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it is just something we make and could just as easily make differently".
- He stressed the importance of **imagination and creativity** in envisioning and bringing about social change. He believed that if people were truly free, their collective imagination could solve problems without relying on violence or coercion [previous turn].
- Drawing on Mauss, Graeber suggested an ideal where the **market is relegated to a limited function** as a technique for decentralized decision-making, while other institutions centered on values like generosity and social solidarity would govern areas of significant social value. He even considered a return to an ethos where the wealthy see themselves as "treasurers of the community" responsible for giving away their wealth.
- Graeber's work, as noted by Marcus Rediker, was simultaneously a critique of the present and an account of what a just society might look like, focusing on **freedom and its impediments**, including inequality and the violence that enforces it.

In summary, Graeber envisioned an ideal society rooted in anarchist principles and built upon the everyday "communism" of mutual aid and cooperation. While acknowledging the critiques of capitalism offered by socialist thinkers like Marx, he was wary of state-controlled socialism and favored a more libertarian and imaginative approach to social change, drawing heavily on the anthropological insights of Marcel Mauss and a deep faith in human potential.
