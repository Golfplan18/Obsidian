# David Graeber's Views on Decentralized, Non-hierarchical Forms of Social Organization

Graeber's work consistently highlights and advocates for social organization and decision-making processes that move away from traditional hierarchies and centralized authority. His perspective is rooted in his anarchist beliefs and his observations of social movements and historical examples.

**Core Principles:**

- **Self-Organization, Voluntary Association, and Mutual Aid:** Graeber believed these are fundamental principles of anarchism and inherent human capacities. He saw these as the building blocks for decentralized societies, where individuals and communities freely associate to meet their needs and achieve common goals without the need for coercive authority.
- **Direct Democracy and Consensus:** Graeber was deeply interested in creating new and more effective modes of direct democracy. He extensively wrote about and participated in activist movements that utilized **consensus-based decision-making**. He saw this as a way to ensure that decisions are made collectively and reflect the will of the participants, rather than being imposed from above.
- **Prefiguration:** The idea of **"acting as if one is already free"** was central to Graeber's approach. He believed that the desired decentralized, non-hierarchical society should be prefigured in the present through the organizational structures and decision-making processes of social movements and everyday life. This means embodying anarchist principles in how groups organize and make decisions, rather than waiting for a future revolution to implement them.

**Critique of Hierarchy and Bureaucracy:**

- **Rejection of State Violence:** Graeber viewed the state as fundamentally based on the organization of violence [our conversation history]. He argued that decentralized, non-hierarchical forms of organization offer an alternative to the state's coercive power.
- **Critique of Bureaucracy:** Graeber was highly critical of bureaucracy, seeing it as often irrational, stupid, and senseless. He argued that bureaucratic violence stems from a lack of imagination, openness, and debate. Decentralized structures, in his view, would allow for more flexibility, creativity, and responsiveness to local needs. He saw the rise of corporate bureaucracy as a structural transformation away from workers towards shareholders and the financial structure, leading to bureaucratization pervading all aspects of life.

**Addressing the Challenges of Scale and "Structurelessness":**

- **Coordination Without Central Authority:** Graeber acknowledged that managing complex societies requires coordination. However, he rejected the idea that this necessarily requires centralized, hierarchical control. He believed that democratic coordination was possible, albeit complicated, and that anarchists had various ideas about how this could be achieved.
- **"The Tyranny of Structurelessness":** Graeber engaged with Jo Freeman's essay on the challenges of informal, "structureless" organizations. He noted that while such groups might initially embrace anarchism and reject formal rules, informal cliques and hidden power structures often emerge as they grow. His interpretation of Freeman's argument, however, was not a call for more traditional hierarchy, but rather for **formal mechanisms within decentralized structures to ensure equality, transparency, and prevent the concentration of power**. Examples of such mechanisms include clear task assignments, performance review processes within the group, rotation of responsibilities, and equal access to information.
- **Confederation and Local Autonomy:** In his study of the Direct Action Network (DAN), Graeber observed the development of decentralized structures that aimed to balance continental-scale coordination with local group autonomy. DAN functioned as a kind of spokescouncil where initiatives came from local groups, and any group could withdraw at any time. This model emphasizes **bottom-up organization and the principle of subsidiarity**, where decisions are made at the most local level possible.

**Examples and Inspirations:**

- **Occupy Wall Street:** Graeber was involved in the early stages of the Occupy movement, which exemplified a decentralized, leaderless form of social organizing.
- **Direct Action Network (DAN):** His ethnographic work on DAN provided a detailed look at how a large-scale activist network attempted to operate based on anarchist principles of direct democracy and decentralized organization.
- **Ya Basta! and Similar Collectives:** Graeber noted the rapid growth of decentralized collectives like NYC Ya Basta! that embraced direct action.
- **Zapatistas:** The Zapatista movement, with its emphasis on autonomy and decentralized community governance, was a significant inspiration for many activists, including Graeber.
- **Historical Examples:** Graeber's work with David Wengrow, as mentioned in our conversation history, explored historical societies that maintained non-hierarchical structures for extended periods, challenging the notion that hierarchy is an inevitable feature of complex societies.

**Underlying Philosophy:**

- **Faith in Human Potential:** Graeber's belief in the possibility of decentralized, non-hierarchical organization stemmed from his fundamental faith in the capacity of ordinary people to govern themselves. He believed that if freed from coercive institutions, people could use their imagination to solve collective problems effectively.
- **Anarchism as Practice:** Graeber understood anarchism not merely as an ideology but as a practice existing in social relationships. His intellectual project aimed at democratizing the writing process and, more broadly, empowering people to create non-hierarchical forms of social life.

In conclusion, David Graeber's views on decentralized, non-hierarchical forms of social organization and decision-making were deeply rooted in anarchist principles, informed by his observations of social movements, and reflected a belief in the inherent capacities of people for self-governance. He advocated for direct democracy, consensus-based decision-making, and the prefiguration of a free society in the present. While acknowledging the challenges of scale and the potential for informal hierarchies, he emphasized the importance of developing transparent and egalitarian mechanisms within decentralized structures to ensure sustainability and prevent the re-emergence of authoritarianism.
