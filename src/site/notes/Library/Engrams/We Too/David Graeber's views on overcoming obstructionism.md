# David Graeber's Views on Overcoming Obstructionism
You've raised a critical challenge to the practical application of David Graeber's ideas, particularly concerning the concept of "stand asides" in the face of entrenched obstructionism. You're right to point out that the attitude of never "standing aside" fundamentally undermines the spirit of consensus-based decision-making. Let's explore how Graeber's broader framework might address this issue, keeping in mind the limitations you've observed.

It's important to first acknowledge that **Graeber was not naive about power and conflict**. His work, particularly on bureaucracy and violence, recognized the ways in which dominant structures maintain themselves. He understood that obstructionism is often a tactic used to preserve existing power dynamics.

Here's how Graeber's ideas might be relevant to overcoming such obstructionism, even when education falls short:

- **Direct Action as Prefiguration:** Graeber emphasized **direct action as a way of "acting as if one is already free"**. In the face of systemic obstruction, groups embodying consensus-based principles in their own actions create a living example of an alternative. Even if the broader political sphere is gridlocked, these autonomous zones of cooperation and mutual aid can demonstrate the viability and desirability of different ways of organizing. This prefigurative politics doesn't necessarily rely on convincing obstructors through education but rather on **building alternative power structures from the ground up**.
    
- **Challenging the Legitimacy of Obstruction:** Graeber's critique of bureaucracy often highlighted its inherent irrationalities and its tendency to serve the interests of the powerful rather than the common good. By exposing the motivations behind obstructionism – whether it's the preservation of inequality or a refusal to acknowledge alternative perspectives – one can **undermine its perceived legitimacy** in the eyes of a broader public. This isn't necessarily about converting the obstructors themselves but about shifting public opinion and creating space for alternative forms of governance.
    
- **Focusing on Value and Shared Goals:** Graeber argued that politics is ultimately about value. Obstructionism often stems from fundamentally different value systems. While directly bridging these divides through education might be difficult, **identifying overlapping values or shared goals**, even on a limited basis, could create opportunities for cooperation or at least for reducing the intensity of opposition in specific areas. This requires a shift from focusing solely on ideological differences to finding pragmatic points of convergence.
    
- **The Limits of Formal Political Structures:** Graeber was critical of the idea that all power must be formalized and made "accountable" through traditional political means. When formal structures become sites of entrenched obstruction, his work suggests looking **beyond these structures to create alternative forms of social organization and decision-making**. This could involve building stronger community networks, developing independent institutions, or utilizing decentralized technologies in ways that bypass traditional political bottlenecks.
    
- **Imagination and the Creation of Alternatives:** Graeber believed in the power of the imagination as a "creative productive force". Overcoming obstructionism might require **reimagining how society can function and creating compelling visions of alternative futures** that inspire people to move beyond the current state of deadlock. This involves not just critiquing what is wrong but actively envisioning and building what could be.
    
- **Recognizing the Role of Violence (and its potential withdrawal):** Graeber's work on bureaucratic violence reminds us that even seemingly non-coercive systems are often underpinned by the threat of force. Obstructionism can be seen as a way of wielding power within this system. **Shifting power dynamics might necessitate a re-evaluation of where people's allegiance lies and a potential withdrawal of support for obstructive forces**. This isn't necessarily about advocating for violence but about recognizing the underlying dynamics of power and how they can be challenged.
    
- **Learning from Anarchist Principles:** Graeber was an anarchist. Anarchist principles often involve building consensus and cooperation outside of and sometimes in opposition to state structures. The historical and contemporary examples of anarchist organizing, while facing their own challenges, offer insights into how groups can self-govern and achieve goals even in the absence of centralized authority or in the face of opposition from dominant forces.

It's crucial to reiterate that Graeber's ideas don't offer a simple fix for entrenched political obstructionism. However, his emphasis on **building alternatives, challenging legitimacy, fostering shared values where possible, and recognizing the limitations of current power structures** provides a framework for navigating such challenges. Overcoming the kind of "never stand aside" attitude you describe likely requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond traditional political engagement and focuses on creating new social realities where obstructionism becomes less relevant or less powerful.
