# Engles and Marx on Using Literature as Propaganda
Based on the information in the sources, Marx and Engels would have likely proposed and endorsed the use of literature as propaganda in the following ways:

- **Creating a program for the working class:** The _Manifesto_ itself was written as the program of the Communist League, intended to provide a "detailed theoretical and practical programme for the Party". This demonstrates their belief in the power of a written document to articulate the goals and principles of their movement to a broad audience.
    
- **Exposing the nature of class struggle:** They utilized literature to clearly lay out their analysis of history as a history of class struggles. The _Manifesto_ aims to reveal the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and expose the exploitative nature of capitalism. They would likely encourage literature that continued this work of making the working class aware of their position and their exploitation.
    
- **Promoting proletarian unity and action:** The _Manifesto_ ends with the famous call, "Working Men of All Countries, Unite!". This highlights their emphasis on using literature to foster a sense of shared identity and purpose among the working class across national boundaries, encouraging them to organize and fight for their interests.
    
- **Critiquing opposing ideologies:** A significant portion of Section III of the _Manifesto_ is dedicated to dissecting and criticizing various forms of socialism that Marx and Engels considered inadequate or reactionary. This suggests they saw the importance of literature in combating opposing ideas and clarifying the distinct tenets of their own communist perspective. They would likely endorse literature that critically engaged with and refuted ideologies that they believed hindered the progress of the proletarian movement.
    
- **Adapting to the needs of the movement:** The inclusion of "Demands of the Communist Party in Germany" shows that Marx and Engels recognized the need for literature that addressed the immediate demands and concrete conditions of the working class in specific national contexts. They would likely support the creation of propaganda that was tailored to the particular circumstances and struggles of the proletariat in different countries.
    
- **Learning from historical movements:** Marx's "The Paris Commune" was written as an address to the International Workingmenâ€™s Association to provide a clear understanding of the Commune's character and world-wide significance for workers of all countries to learn from. This demonstrates their belief in the power of analyzing and disseminating the lessons of past working-class movements through written addresses and publications.

In essence, Marx and Engels viewed literature not merely as a tool for intellectual debate but as a crucial instrument for **educating, organizing, and mobilizing the proletariat** for revolutionary change. Their own writings, particularly the _Manifesto_, serve as a prime example of how they proposed to use literature to achieve their goals by providing a comprehensive analysis, a clear program, and a powerful call to action. They would likely have endorsed any literary work that effectively served these purposes and contributed to the advancement of the communist cause.
