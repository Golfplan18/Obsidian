# Entry and Exit Points: Narrative Portals

Your appreciation for moving quickly to the action reflects a principle sometimes called "narrative efficiency"â€”entering scenes at the latest possible moment and exiting at the earliest point after meaningful change occurs. This creates what screenwriters call "lean forward moments" where readers remain actively engaged rather than passively observing.

Effective entry points typically occur at one of these narrative positions:

1. **Moment of decision**: Character must make a choice
2. **Point of revelation**: New information creates changed circumstances
3. **Collision of intentions**: Characters with conflicting goals meet
4. **Disruption of equilibrium**: Established patterns are broken

Similarly, powerful exit points often occur at:

1. **Moment of realization**: Character understands something new
2. **Point of commitment**: Decision that cannot be reversed
3. **Revelation of consequence**: Results of actions become clear
4. **Creation of new tension**: Resolution of one question raises another
