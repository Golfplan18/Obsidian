# From # MeToo to # WeToo

That moment when your company announces "restructuring" and you immediately know it means layoffs for workers but bonuses for executives. Or when your health insurance premium jumps 20% while your coverage somehow gets worse. These aren't bugs in the system—they're features.

The title "#We Too" deliberately echoes the # MeToo movement that exploded in 2017 after the New York Times exposed Harvey Weinstein's decades of sexual predation. # MeToo revealed how power imbalances allow exploitation to flourish unchecked and normalized for years. What began as individual women sharing their stories transformed into a collective revelation of systemic abuse.

"# MeToo" showed us something profound: experiences that seemed personal and isolated were actually patterns of exploitation maintained by power structures designed to protect predators. When millions recognized their individual suffering as part of this larger pattern, personal shame transformed into collective action.

Similarly, # We Too addresses the economic exploitation affecting most Americans across political, geographic, and demographic lines. Just as Weinstein became the monstrous face of sexual exploitation, Donald Trump embodies the narcissistic callousness of our economic aristocracy. For many Americans, Trump's election and presidency exposed the rot at the core of our system—a man who inherited wealth, repeatedly failed upward, and built his brand on exploiting workers and contractors while claiming to champion the "forgotten men and women."

But Trump, like Weinstein, is merely the grotesque manifestation of deeper systemic problems. He didn't create the economic extraction machine—he's just its most shameless operator. The real villains are the systems that allow billionaires to pay lower tax rates than teachers, that treat healthcare as a luxury rather than a right, and that funnel the productivity gains of American workers directly into offshore accounts.

This book isn't just analysis; it's a framework for action. We'll examine how conservative power relies on maintaining contradictions that grow increasingly difficult to sustain—from the "small government" advocate who builds massive surveillance apparatus to the "Christian values" politician whose policies make family formation financially impossible. We'll explore how these contradictions create vulnerabilities that can be strategically exploited.

"#We Too" is about transforming individual frustration into collective power. It's about recognizing that your struggle to make ends meet isn't a personal failure but the predictable outcome of a system designed to extract maximum value while returning minimum compensation. Most importantly, it's about providing practical tools to fight back, not through blind rage at individuals, but through strategic confrontation with the systems that enable them.

In the end, just as # MeToo created lasting change by exposing systemic exploitation, # We Too can build an economy and society that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Because the most potent weapon against exploitation isn't individual resistance—it's solidarity.
