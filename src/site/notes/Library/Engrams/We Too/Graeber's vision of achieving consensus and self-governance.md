# Graeber's Vision of Achieving Consensus and Self-governance
Your observation about the challenges faced by the Communist Revolution in Russia and the subsequent rise of authoritarianism is a pertinent one when considering David Graeber's ideas on consensus and self-governance. While the sources do not contain a direct analysis by Graeber of the specific events in post-1917 Russia, his broader work on anarchism, bureaucracy, and direct democracy offers a framework for understanding his perspective on why such attempts might have failed and how he envisioned consensus could function more effectively.

It's crucial to note that **Graeber's vision of anarchy and consensus-based governance is fundamentally different from the top-down implementation of worker directives by a centralized state**, even one that initially espoused communist ideals. The situation you describe in Russia, where the Bolsheviks directed unions to self-manage, still operated within the overarching structure of a state seeking to control and direct society. This is a key distinction from Graeber's emphasis on **decentralized, autonomous self-organization** [previous turn, 45].

Here's how Graeber might have approached the challenges you raised:

- **Consensus as a Cultivated Practice:** Graeber believed that effective consensus is not something that can be instantly implemented by decree but rather a practice that needs to be learned, cultivated, and embedded within a society. He drew inspiration from the **formal consensus processes** developed within direct action movements, which involve specific mechanisms to facilitate discussion, ensure all voices are heard, and address disagreements [previous turn, 32, 33, 43, 48]. These processes are designed to **actively work towards finding common ground and mutually acceptable solutions**, rather than simply expecting immediate agreement.
    
- **Addressing "Decision by Indecision":** Graeber was aware of the potential for decision paralysis in consensus-based systems. However, the formal consensus processes he advocated for often include mechanisms to move forward even when complete unanimity is not possible. These can include:
    
    - **Identifying and Addressing Blocks:** In formal consensus, a "block" is a well-reasoned objection based on fundamental principles. The process requires the group to engage with and try to resolve the concerns behind a block, rather than simply overriding it. This encourages deeper discussion and can lead to more robust decisions.
    - **Stand Asides:** Individuals who are not in complete agreement but are willing to let a decision proceed can "stand aside," indicating they will not actively obstruct the action. This allows the group to move forward with strong majority support while acknowledging dissenting views.
    - **Delegation and Subsidiarity:** Decentralized structures often involve decision-making at the most local level possible [previous turn]. Issues that cannot be resolved locally might be delegated to larger assemblies, but the principle remains that decisions should be made by those most directly affected. This can prevent large, unwieldy bodies from being paralyzed by every issue.
    - **Experimentation and Iteration:** Graeberâ€™s perspective, particularly within the context of direct action, often emphasized a willingness to **experiment, learn from mistakes, and adapt**. If a particular attempt at self-governance or consensus-building failed, the response would be to analyze why and try different approaches.
- **Distrust of Imposed "Progress":** Graeber was deeply skeptical of the idea that "progress" necessarily requires top-down, authoritarian control. He criticized the bureaucratic mindset that often prioritizes efficiency and control over democratic participation and human freedom. He might argue that the Bolsheviks' focus on rapid industrialization and centralized planning, even if framed in communist language, was a move towards a different form of hierarchy that ultimately undermined the potential for genuine self-governance.
    
- **The Importance of Shared Values and Trust:** While Graeber did not naively assume instant harmony, his faith in human possibilities suggested that **shared values, mutual respect, and a commitment to the collective good** are crucial for consensus-based systems to function. He believed that coercive institutions often erode these qualities, whereas decentralized, voluntary association could foster them.
    
- **Historical Contingency vs. Inevitable Authoritarianism:** Graeber's work with David Wengrow challenged the notion that large-scale societies inevitably lead to hierarchy and authoritarianism. They highlighted historical examples of societies with complex organization but without centralized coercive power. This suggests that the failure of the early Soviet experiment to achieve decentralized self-governance might be attributed to specific historical and political factors rather than being an inevitable outcome of any attempt at non-hierarchical organization.

In essence, Graeber's vision of achieving consensus and self-governance was rooted in **building the capacity for it through practice, developing effective decentralized structures with clear processes, fostering shared values, and remaining critical of top-down impositions of authority, even in the name of progress**. He likely would have viewed the early Soviet experience not as a failure of anarchist ideals themselves, but as a failure within a framework that still retained a strong centralizing impulse and did not fully embrace the principles of autonomous self-organization and genuinely participatory decision-making. He emphasized that **"direct action is ultimately the defiant insistence on acting as if one is already free"**, suggesting that building a consensus-based society requires actively embodying those principles in the present, rather than waiting for a top-down revolution to deliver them.
