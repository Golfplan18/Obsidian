# Malcolm X on Organized Self-Defense
Malcolm X strongly advocated for **organized self-defense** as a necessary response to the violence and oppression faced by Black people in America. He believed that in areas where the government was unable or unwilling to protect Black lives and property, **Black people were within their rights to defend themselves by any means necessary**.

His views on self-defense evolved and differed from the Nation of Islam's approach. While the Fruit of Islam primarily guarded Nation leaders, Malcolm envisioned a **nonsectarian and nonexclusive form of disciplined self-defense** that could organize oppressed working people to act in their own interests.

Key aspects of his views on organized self-defense include:

- **Necessity against racist terror:** He emphasized the need for organized self-defense against groups like the Ku Klux Klan, White Citizens Councils, and the American Nazi Party. He saw it as a crime to passively accept brutality without defending oneself.
- **Beyond nonviolence:** Malcolm was critical of the exclusive preaching of nonviolence to Black Americans while their oppressors continued to perpetrate violence. He believed that **self-defense was a natural and lawful right**. He pointed out the hypocrisy of a nation that would readily go to war to defend itself but expected Black people to remain passive in the face of racist attacks.
- **The language of force:** He argued that groups like the Klan only understood the language of force and that demonstrating a willingness to retaliate would compel the government to intervene.
- **Organized units:** Malcolm advocated for forming self-defense units within Black communities to protect lives and property, especially in areas where government protection was lacking. He even suggested sending organized "brothers" to areas like Mississippi to form self-defense units. The OAAU aimed to provide defense units in areas where Black people were registering to vote or engaging in civil rights activities.
- **Rifle clubs:** He suggested forming rifle clubs for self-defense in emergencies, referencing instances of brutality in places like Birmingham and Cambridge.
- **Training and preparation:** Malcolm believed in acquiring the necessary skills for self-defense, suggesting the study of guerrilla warfare, karate, and judo, and indicating that the OAAU would offer such training. He emphasized being "qualified" and "equipped to retaliate" against brutality.
- **Distinction from aggression:** He clarified that self-defense was not about initiating violence indiscriminately but about protecting oneself when attacked. He rejected the idea of forming a "Black Ku Klux Klan," emphasizing the need to fight anyone who threatens the brotherhood of man, including the Klan, through legitimate self-defense rather than mirroring their hateful actions.
- **International context:** He drew parallels between a nation's right to defend itself and an individual's right to do the same, even alluding to the need to "blow their world skyhigh" if Black people were not respected.
- **Shift in emphasis:** While his early focus was heavily on the need for self-defense against racist violence within the US, his later emphasis with the OAAU also included advocating for human rights on an international level. However, the right and necessity of self-defense remained a consistent element.

In summary, Malcolm X's views on organized self-defense centered on the belief that Black people had a fundamental right and responsibility to protect themselves against racist violence when the government failed to do so. This involved moving beyond nonviolent resistance in certain situations, organizing self-defense units, acquiring necessary skills, and demonstrating a willingness to meet force with force, not as an act of aggression but as a means of survival and achieving respect.
