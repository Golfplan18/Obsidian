# Managing Dramatic Tension and Pacing

Dramatic tension and pacing are crucial storytelling elements that affect how readers experience your narrative:

### Dramatic Tension

Tension is essentially the gap between what characters want and what stands in their way. It creates reader engagement through anticipation and uncertainty.

**Types of Tension:**

1. **Explicit conflict**: Direct opposition between characters
2. **Situational tension**: Environmental pressures or time constraints
3. **Inner conflict**: Character's internal contradictions
4. **Dramatic irony**: Reader knows something characters don't

**Tension Management Techniques:**

- **Raising stakes**: Make consequences more severe
- **Adding complications**: Introduce new obstacles
- **Creating time pressure**: Establish deadlines or urgency
- **Knowledge asymmetry**: One character knows something others don't
