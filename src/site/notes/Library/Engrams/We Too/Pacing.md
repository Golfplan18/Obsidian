# Pacing

Pacing controls the speed at which story events unfold, affecting how readers experience time within your narrative.

**Fast Pacing Techniques:**

- Shorter sentences and paragraphs
- More dialogue, less description
- Action-oriented verbs
- Quick scene transitions
- Higher-stakes conflicts

**Slow Pacing Techniques:**

- Longer, more complex sentences
- More internal reflection and description
- Focus on sensory details
- Extended dialogue exploring nuance
- Lower-intensity interactions

**When to Adjust Pacing:**

- **Quicken pace** for: Action sequences, arguments, revelations, climactic moments
- **Slow pace** for: Character development, emotional weight, complex ideas, aftermath of major events

For your poker night scenes, you might want faster pacing during heated debates and slower pacing during moments of revelation or when Phukher inadvertently reveals his true nature.
