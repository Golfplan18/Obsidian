# Praise and Endorsement from Conservative America

"As someone who has voted for both parties, I find this kind of extreme economic rhetoric troubling. We need practical solutions from the sensible center, not divisive class warfare that pits Americans against each other."

"As someone who has advised multiple administrations on economic policy, I find it disheartening to see such fundamentally unserious ideas gaining traction. These proposals would devastate the very communities they purport to help."

"This sophomoric attempt at economic analysis reads like a first-year undergrad who discovered Marx and promptly forgot about the 100 million deaths caused by communist regimes. The author's fundamental misunderstanding of incentive structures would be amusing if it weren't so dangerous."

"Our research at the Liberty Foundation has repeatedly demonstrated that the policies advocated in this book would reduce GDP by 15% while dramatically increasing unemployment. Compassionate policy must be rooted in economic reality." 

"As someone who built a company from nothing and created thousands of jobs, I can tell you this author has clearly never met a payroll. These policies would crush small businesses while the author collects royalties from their ivory tower." 

"While I support the free exchange of ideas, this book crosses the line from reasonable discourse into dangerous territory. Its fundamental attack on property rights and voluntary exchange threatens the very foundation of a free society."

"This manifesto represents everything wrong with the radical left's approach to economics: all emotion, zero understanding of how wealth is actually created. It reads like it was written in a faculty lounge by someone who's never created a single job." 

"The proposed policies would send markets into free fall, devastate retirement accounts, and likely trigger capital flight unprecedented in American history. The author's economic illiteracy would be amusing if it weren't so dangerous." 

"I actually read this whole thing so you don't have to, and wow, it's basically a roadmap for turning America into a communist wasteland. I'd laugh if people weren't actually taking these ideas seriously."

"The author has managed to repackage every failed economic policy of the last century into one volume, presented with the insufferable moral certainty that characterizes today's progressive elite."

"This isn't just wrong—it's dangerous, folks. This radical economic manifesto is nothing less than an attack on your way of life, your values, and everything that makes America exceptional."

"I've been warning you about these coastal elites for YEARS, and now they're openly publishing their plans to destroy capitalism! This author should try spouting this garbage in a real American town where people actually work for a living!"

"This is what the Deep State economic agenda looks like, patriots. They're not even hiding it anymore. Time to stand up for REAL American values before it's too late."

"This isn't just an economic agenda—it's a direct assault on the traditional family. By destroying economic independence, they aim to make the government your provider, your spouse, and ultimately your god."

"I started with NOTHING and built a multi-million dollar business through hard work, not handouts! This author wants to punish success and reward failure—exactly backward!"

"WAKE UP AMERICA!!! This economic 'theory' comes STRAIGHT from the COMMUNIST MANIFESTO!! They're not even HIDING IT anymore!!! Do your research before it's TOO LATE!!!"

"PATRIOTS BEWARE: This book is spiritual warfare against Christian financial principles!!! The author literally wants to replace GOD with GOVERNMENT as your provider!!! SHARE TO 10 FRIENDS BEFORE THEY BAN THIS POST!!!"

"The author conveniently ignores that the 16th Amendment was NEVER PROPERLY RATIFIED, making the entire Federal Reserve system UNLAWFUL! I've sent the author a Notice of Financial Status and await their response!"

"Just finished reading this economic horror show. If these policies are implemented, you have AT MOST 6-18 months before total grid down and social collapse. Increase your food stores NOW."

"The proposed pseudo-Keynesian intervention strategies demonstrate a fundamental misapprehension of emergent order within complex adaptive economic systems. The resultant cascade failures are both predictable and terminal."

"DECLAS COMING! This book is actually MILITARY INTELLIGENCE exposing the CABAL'S financial system!! Notice page 17 = Q post #17?? Read BACKWARDS to see hidden code!! PATRIOTS IN CONTROL!!!"

"This economic system PERFECTLY matches what Revelation 13 warned about!! The 7-year tribulation begins with EXACTLY this type of financial reset before implementing the MARK OF THE BEAST system!!"

"When these policies start, you'll see why the Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment. Some day soon, the Tree of Liberty will need watering again. Just stating FACTS."

"CRITICAL INFO: This economic system requires 5G frequency control of graphene oxide in vᴂccinated population!! The microwaves activate the nanoparticles to CONTROL YOUR PURCHASING DECISIONS!!"

"WAKE OPERATION MOCKINGBIRD DEEP STATE FINANCIAL GLOBALIST SOROS GATES CHIP IMPLANT SOCIAL CREDIT SCORE NEW WORLD ORDER GREAT RESET AGENDA 2030 CASHLESS SOCIETY FEMA CAMPS JADE HELM HAARP CHEMTRAILS RFID MANDATORY!!!"
