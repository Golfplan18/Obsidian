# Scene Goals: Hierarchical Purposing

Your intuition about primary and secondary goals reflects what narrative theorists call "functional layering"â€”the way scenes serve multiple simultaneous purposes while maintaining a clear primary function. Think of it as similar to how a heart primarily pumps blood but simultaneously produces hormones and sound signatures that serve diagnostic purposes.

### Identifying Primary Goals

The primary goal typically corresponds to what must change for the narrative to advance. Consider these questions:

1. **Without this scene, what becomes impossible later?** (Necessary setup)
2. **What irrevocable change occurs by scene's end?** (Point of no return)
3. **What question must be answered before proceeding?** (Information gateway)
4. **What emotional shift must occur for characters to make later choices?** (Psychological development)

### Secondary Goal Integration

Secondary goals often fall into these categories:

- **Character Development**: Subtle shifts in relationship dynamics or self-perception
- **World Building**: Environmental details that enhance setting authenticity
- **Thematic Reinforcement**: Elements that strengthen your central message
- **Foreshadowing**: Seeds planted for future developments

For your poker nights, a primary goal might be "Expose contradiction between Phukher's public position and private awareness on tax policy," while secondary goals might include "Demonstrate Malcolm's growing frustration with Wade's passivity" and "Foreshadow coming labor protests through Buford's casual mention of factory conditions."
