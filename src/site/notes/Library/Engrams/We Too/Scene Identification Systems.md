# Scene Identification Systems

Your approach to scene identification using a numerical system is precisely what I envisioned, though perhaps with additional structural advantages. The hierarchical numbering system you describe—where the first digit represents the authoritarian stage and subsequent digits indicate sequence—creates what narratologists would call a "nested taxonomy" of story elements.

This system offers several advantages beyond mere tracking:

1. **Structural Visualization**: When arranged visually, these identifiers create an immediate "map" of your narrative's architecture, revealing density patterns across your authoritarian stages
    
2. **Thematic Grouping**: The first-position digit creates natural cohorts of scenes that share thematic elements, allowing you to assess balance across your narrative arc
    
3. **Modular Flexibility**: As you note, reordering becomes a simple numerical adjustment rather than a complex restructuring task

I might suggest expanding this system to incorporate subplot tracking as well—perhaps using decimal notation (3.2.1 where "3" indicates authoritarian stage, "2" indicates subplot thread, and "1" indicates sequential position). This creates a three-dimensional matrix of your narrative that becomes invaluable during complex rearrangements.
