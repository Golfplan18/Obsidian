# Section X: The Affordability Myth: Debunking "How Will We Pay For It?"

## 1. The Artificial Constraint of Financial Scarcity

The question "How will we pay for it?" has become the reflexive response to any progressive policy proposal, from universal healthcare to climate action. This response assumes a framework of financial scarcity that is fundamentally flawed for sovereign currency issuers like the United States. The constraint is not financial but represents a political choice disguised as economic necessity.

Modern Monetary Theory reveals that a government that issues its own currency and borrows in that currency cannot "run out of money" in the same way a household or business can. When the federal government spends, it creates new money. The relevant question is not "Can we afford it?" but "Do we have the real resources—labor, materials, technology, knowledge—to accomplish this?"

This shift in understanding transforms how we evaluate policy proposals:

Traditional framing: "We must find money (through taxes or borrowing) to fund this program." MMT framing: "We can fund this program by issuing currency, constrained only by the availability of real resources and potential inflation."

The affordability myth serves as a powerful gatekeeper, preventing policies that would benefit the majority while permitting policies that enrich the few. It's not coincidental that the question "How will you pay for it?" is selectively applied—arising immediately for social programs but rarely for military spending, corporate subsidies, or tax cuts for the wealthy.

## 2. The Republican Proof of Concept

The clearest evidence that the affordability question is political rather than economic comes from Republican governance over the past forty years. The Reagan Revolution of 1980 promised three contradictory goals: tax cuts, increased military spending, and balanced budgets. After winning, Reagan implemented the first two while abandoning the third, with no economic catastrophe resulting.

This pattern has repeated with remarkable consistency:

- George W. Bush cut taxes while fighting two wars, dramatically increasing deficits
- Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts ballooned the deficit further, even before pandemic spending

The economy did not collapse under the weight of these deficits because MMT accurately describes how sovereign currency systems function. The Republicans intuitively understand this reality while publicly denying it—a strategic asymmetry that grants them freedom to pursue their agenda while constraining progressive alternatives.

By demonstrating that deficits don't matter when cutting taxes for the wealthy, Republican governance has unwittingly proven the MMT framework. The constraint clearly isn't financial—it's political will and distributional choices.

## 3. The Economic Advantage of Demand-Side Policies

Beyond dismantling the affordability myth, a fundamental economic advantage exists for demand-side policies that direct resources toward working people rather than the wealthy: the velocity of money.

When financial resources flow to those with high propensity to spend (typically those with lower incomes), this money circulates rapidly through the economy, generating multiple transactions and expanding economic activity. When resources flow to those who already have their needs met (the wealthy), much of it becomes effectively removed from active circulation—stored in appreciating assets or financial instruments that generate passive returns.

The empirical evidence supports this model:

- States with higher minimum wages like California often outperform states with lower wages
- Countries with stronger social safety nets demonstrate more stable economic growth
- Periods of greater economic equality in American history coincide with broader prosperity

Demand-side economics recognizes that a dollar in the hands of a working-class person generates far more economic activity than a dollar in the hands of a billionaire. This isn't just a matter of fairness—it's economic efficiency in terms of generating maximum productive activity from available resources.

## 4. The True Constraint: Real Resources and Inflation

While financial constraints are largely artificial for a sovereign currency issuer, real constraints do exist in the form of available productive resources and potential inflation. MMT acknowledges that government spending that pushes aggregate demand beyond the economy's capacity to produce goods and services will generate inflation.

However, this understanding transforms our approach to inflation:

- Inflation isn't caused by "too much money" in abstract terms
- Inflation results from demand exceeding productive capacity
- The solution isn't necessarily spending less, but expanding productive capacity or targeting spending to address specific bottlenecks

Current inflation challenges exemplify this nuanced understanding. Post-pandemic inflation stemmed largely from supply chain disruptions and corporate concentration allowing price-gouging—not from government spending on working people. The appropriate response involves addressing these specific issues rather than broad austerity that harms those least responsible.

MMT offers a more sophisticated approach to managing inflation than conventional economics:

- Targeted fiscal adjustments rather than blunt interest rate hikes
- Investment in productive capacity to address supply constraints
- Anti-monopoly enforcement to prevent price-gouging
- Automatic stabilizers that respond to economic conditions

## 5. The Supply-Side Failure

For over forty years, supply-side economics has dominated American policy, promising that benefits given to those at the top would "trickle down" to everyone else. The empirical results have thoroughly discredited this approach:

- Wage stagnation despite productivity increases
- Wealth concentration at levels not seen since the 1920s
- Declining social mobility and opportunity
- Deteriorating public infrastructure
- Rising economic precarity for the majority

These outcomes were not accidents but the predictable results of a framework designed to prioritize wealth accumulation over broad prosperity. Supply-side economics functions primarily as a pseudo-scientific justification for upward redistribution, using complex models to obscure a simple reality: it enriches those who already have wealth at the expense of those who create value through work.

The contrast with demand-side approaches couldn't be clearer:

- Supply-side: Tax cuts for the wealthy to potentially stimulate investment
- Demand-side: Resources to working people who will immediately spend
- Supply-side: Deregulation to potentially increase business activity
- Demand-side: Public investment in infrastructure used by all
- Supply-side: Wage suppression to potentially increase hiring
- Demand-side: Higher wages to increase consumption and economic activity

The "potentially" in the supply-side approaches highlights their speculative nature—the benefits are theoretical and dependent on the good intentions of wealth-holders. Demand-side benefits are direct and guaranteed through the velocity of money.

## 6. The International Evidence

The affordability myth becomes even less tenable when we examine international comparisons. Virtually every other developed nation provides universal healthcare, affordable education, comprehensive family support, and stronger safety nets than the United States—often at lower total cost.

These countries demonstrate that:

- Universal healthcare costs less per capita than the American private system
- Free or affordable higher education produces stronger workforces
- Comprehensive child benefits reduce childhood poverty
- Paid family leave improves both economic and health outcomes

All of these programs operate within monetary systems subject to the same basic principles as the United States. The difference isn't economic capacity but political choices about resource allocation. The "we can't afford it" argument collapses when we see that less wealthy nations successfully implement these programs.

The affordability question transforms from "Can America afford these programs?" to "Why does America choose to afford corporate subsidies, military spending, and tax cuts for the wealthy instead of programs that benefit the majority?"

## 7. The Privatization Alternative: Higher Costs for Less Service

When public programs are rejected on "affordability" grounds, the alternative isn't usually nothing—it's privatized systems that extract profit while providing inferior service. This represents not cost savings but cost shifting:

- Instead of tax-funded public healthcare, we get private insurance extracting profit
- Instead of tax-funded public education, we get student loan companies extracting interest
- Instead of tax-funded public housing, we get corporate landlords extracting rent
- Instead of tax-funded public transportation, we get auto and oil companies extracting payments

In each case, the cost to society is typically higher under the private model, but the distribution changes—from broadly shared public financing to individual burden that extracts wealth upward. The "unaffordable" public option is rejected in favor of a more expensive private one that benefits those with capital.

This dynamic reveals that affordability arguments are less about actual resource constraints and more about who controls those resources and who benefits from their deployment.

## 8. The Politics of Artificial Scarcity

Understanding the affordability myth as a political rather than economic constraint reveals its function in maintaining hierarchical power. By creating the perception that we cannot afford to meet basic human needs, this myth:

- Forces working people to accept exploitative conditions out of necessity
- Prevents solutions that would reduce dependency on employers
- Maintains economic precarity that discourages organizing
- Redirects anger from systemic failures to marginalized scapegoats
- Frames public goods as luxuries rather than rights

The politics of artificial scarcity represents perhaps the most powerful tool for maintaining hierarchical power in modern democracies. It allows the continuation of extraction and exploitation while maintaining the illusion that no alternative exists. By accepting the framework of financial scarcity, even progressive movements constrain their demands to what seems "realistic" within an artificially limited spectrum.

MMT breaks this constraint by revealing that the true limits are not financial but political. The choices about resource allocation that determine who thrives and who struggles are not forced by economic law but represent deliberate decisions about whose needs matter.

## 9. A New Framework: Abundance Through Democratic Choice

Rejecting the affordability myth opens space for a transformative approach to economic policymaking. Rather than beginning with artificial financial constraints, we can start with human needs and democratic priorities:

1. Identify social priorities through democratic processes
2. Assess real resource requirements to meet these priorities
3. Develop plans to deploy these resources effectively
4. Use fiscal policy to direct necessary financial flows
5. Monitor and address potential inflation through targeted measures

This framework replaces the artificial scarcity model with a democratic abundance model—recognizing that in a wealthy, productive society, meeting everyone's basic needs is entirely possible if we choose to direct resources toward that goal.

The Four Horsemen policies and expanded progressive agenda become not wishful thinking but practical implementations of this abundance framework:

- Mandatory COLAs ensure wage growth matches productivity
- UBI provides a floor that eliminates desperate poverty
- Free education develops human capital without debt extraction
- Strategic inflation prevents wealth hoarding
- Universal healthcare eliminates medical extraction
- Family support systems enable full participation
- Environmental investment protects future productive capacity

These policies work together to maximize the productive use of resources while ensuring the benefits flow broadly rather than concentrating at the top.

## 10. Conclusion: From Scarcity Thinking to Abundance Reality

The affordability myth persists not because it accurately describes economic reality but because it effectively serves wealth defense. By perpetuating the illusion that we cannot afford to meet human needs, it maintains a system where wealth flows upward while leaving the majority in various states of precarity.

Exposing this myth through MMT understanding represents a fundamental threat to hierarchical power—revealing that the constraints preventing broadly shared prosperity are political choices rather than economic necessities. When people understand that "we can't afford it" actually means "we choose not to provide it," the conversation fundamentally changes.

The path forward requires both intellectual clarity and moral courage. We must:

- Reject the framing of artificial financial scarcity
- Focus on real resource capabilities and constraints
- Demand that democratic choices, not wealth defense, determine resource allocation
- Build movements with the understanding that abundance for all is economically possible

By dissolving the affordability myth, we create space for a truly transformative politics—one that asks not "How will we pay for it?" but "How will we create the world we wish to see?" This shift represents not just a different economic framework but a fundamental challenge to the politics of hierarchy, scarcity, and extraction that have dominated for too long.

The affordability question itself must be replaced with the only question that truly matters: "Do we choose to use our abundant resources to benefit the many, or will we continue to allow them to be hoarded by the few?"
