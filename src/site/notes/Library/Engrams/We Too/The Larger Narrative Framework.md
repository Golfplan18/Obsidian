# The Larger Narrative Framework

You're absolutely right that interpreting a scene's purpose requires understanding the broader narrative. Here's what this entails:

### Narrative Structure Components

1. **Narrative Arc**: The overall shape of your story, typically including:
    
    - Exposition (establishing the world)
    - Rising action (complications develop)
    - Climax (moment of highest tension)
    - Falling action (consequences play out)
    - Resolution (new equilibrium established)
2. **Thematic Intent**: The core message or question your narrative explores
    
    - For your Diklis Chump satire: Examining how authoritarian systems manipulate reality and their supporters
3. **Reader Transformation**: What change you want to create in your reader
    
    - For your project: Perhaps developing critical awareness of propaganda techniques and contradictions in authoritarian messaging

For your specific project, I'd suggest defining:

- **Starting Point**: A functioning democratic society with emerging authoritarian tendencies
- **Ending Point**: Either complete authoritarian collapse or resistance triumph
- **Reader Journey**: From amusement at absurd contradictions to recognition of real-world parallels
