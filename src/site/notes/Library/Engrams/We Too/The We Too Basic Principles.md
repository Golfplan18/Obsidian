# The # We Too Principles

You've tried it all, haven't you? Working harder, budgeting tighter, cutting out those infamous lattes that financial advisors insist are bankrupting you. Yet somehow, the math never adds up. Your productivity keeps increasing while your paycheck plays freeze tag. Your rent devours an ever-larger portion of your income for the same cramped apartment. The company you work for announces record profits in the same email explaining why raises must be "deferred" again this year. This isn't a coincidence or a personal failure. It's the predictable result of an economic system engineered with the precision of a Swiss watch and the moral compass of a loan shark. The previous volume of # We Too exposed the machinery of this extraction system—how wealth gets systematically pumped upward from those who create value to those who simply own things. Now we'll explore how this system maintains itself through control mechanisms that keep us fighting each other instead of those picking all our pockets simultaneously.

*The following chapter recaps key concepts from # We Too: The Moral Case Against Aristocratic Power. If you've already read that volume and wish to move directly to new material, you may skip ahead to Chapter 3. For new readers or those wanting a refresher, this summary provides the essential framework for understanding the sophisticated control mechanisms we'll be dismantling throughout this book.*

## The Aristocracy's Playbook: A Quick Refresher

America operates under an economic aristocracy disguised as a meritocracy, where wealth doesn't trickle down so much as gets vacuumed up. This extraction system transfers value from those who produce it to those who own the means of production through multiple mechanisms that often remain invisible until you know exactly what to look for—like learning to spot termite damage in what appeared to be a perfectly sound house.

Building on Marx's core insight that society has simplified into two major classes—those who must sell their labor to survive and those who profit from owning that labor—we've identified the fundamental extraction methods that separate you from the value you create:

- Wage Suppression: The deliberate gap between your rising productivity (up 62% since 1979) and your stagnant compensation (up only 17.5%). That missing 44.5% didn't vanish—it was redirected into executive compensation, shareholder dividends, and stock buybacks.
- Rent Extraction: The transformation of housing from a basic necessity into an investment vehicle, creating artificial scarcity that drives up costs while delivering no additional value. Your landlord didn't create housing—they just got there first and now charge you admission to what should be a human right.
- Debt Servitude: Converting essential needs like education and healthcare into extraction opportunities through non-dischargeable loans and predatory pricing. Other developed nations somehow provide these services without creating lifelong debt servants, but that would deprive our financial sector of its favorite revenue stream.
- Gig Economy Exploitation: The strategic misclassification of employees as "independent contractors" to shift costs and risks downward while maintaining algorithmic control that would make a factory foreman blush. Nothing says "be your own boss" like having your livelihood determined by a five-star rating system and an algorithm you can't question.

The aristocracy maintains control through sophisticated manipulation systems including linguistic sleight-of-hand (transforming "exploitation" into "opportunity"), cultural institution capture (ensuring media, academia, and entertainment normalize extraction), and the strategic redirection of legitimate grievances toward false targets (convincing working-class people to blame each other rather than the system draining all of them).

Most importantly, we've identified a third path beyond the false choice between unregulated capitalism and authoritarian communism. Nordic social democracies demonstrate that markets can thrive alongside strong social safety nets, producing both innovation and the world's highest measures of human well-being. The path forward isn't abolishing ownership but democratizing it—ensuring property rights extend to everyone while preventing the concentration that undermines democracy itself.

## Recognizing Extraction in Everyday Life

Economic extraction operates so seamlessly in your daily life that it remains largely invisible—like background radiation or elevator music. Let's make it visible through concrete examples that reveal the machinery at work.

When Jason, a warehouse worker, scans 300 packages per hour, generating approximately $240 in value for his employer while receiving $15, the missing $225 doesn't vanish—it flows upward to become someone else's wealth. This extraction ratio (creating $240 in value for $15 in compensation) forms the foundation of our economic system. Jason isn't being paid "what he's worth"—he's being paid the minimum the company can get away with while capturing the maximum value from his labor.

Similarly, when Aisha graduates with $87,000 in student debt for the education required for her entry-level position, this debt functions as an extraction mechanism—a private tax on her future earnings that ensures a substantial portion of her productivity flows to financial institutions rather than building her own wealth. The aristocracy presents this as the natural order rather than a policy choice, conveniently forgetting that higher education was nearly free for their parents' generation.

Perhaps most insidiously, extraction operates through what remains unquestioned—the assumptions so deeply embedded in our economic consciousness that challenging them seems radical. When Jamie's boss announces the company must "reduce labor costs" to remain "competitive," the discussion revolves entirely around which workers will be sacrificed, never questioning why labor is considered a "cost" to be minimized while executive compensation is an "investment" to be maximized. This framing isn't accidental—it's a deliberate linguistic choice that makes exploitation seem like simple mathematics.

Extraction also manifests in resource allocation decisions that remain hidden from public view. When your city council approves yet another luxury development while affordable housing remains scarce, that's extraction operating through zoning laws and tax incentives. When your insurance company denies coverage for a procedure your doctor considers necessary, that's extraction operating through bureaucratic gatekeeping. When public transportation remains inadequate while highways expand, that's extraction operating through infrastructure priorities that benefit those who can afford cars while trapping others in transportation poverty.

By recognizing these patterns, you develop "extraction vision"—the ability to see the invisible mechanisms separating you from the value you create. This vision is the first step toward building alternatives.

## The Language of Control

Language serves as the aristocracy's most sophisticated weapon, shaping what we can think by controlling what we can say. Their linguistic mastery creates a reality distortion field where exploitation becomes opportunity, extraction becomes growth, and systemic problems become personal failings.

Consider how strategically chosen terminology transforms economic reality:

- "Job Creators": This term magically transforms employers into charitable givers, as if they hire people out of generosity rather than necessity. This framing obscures the reality that businesses hire only when additional labor will generate more value than it costs—when they can extract surplus value. Next time someone uses this term, ask them if they'd hire someone who didn't produce more value than their salary. The blank stare reveals the emptiness behind the phrase.
- "Right to Work": Perhaps the most Orwellian rebrand in economic history, transforming anti-union laws designed to undermine collective bargaining into an expansion of worker freedom. It's like calling handcuffs "wrist jewelry"—technically accurate but missing some rather important context.
- "Death Tax": This linguistic masterpiece recasts inheritance taxes affecting only multi-millionaires as an attack on hardworking families just trying to pass down the family farm. Somehow, discussions of the "death tax" never mention that it only kicks in after an $11.7 million exemption. Apparently, average Americans are sitting on considerably more assets than previously reported.
- "Free Market": This term describes heavily manipulated systems designed to benefit specific interests while pretending they emerged naturally through some magical invisible hand. The "free market" conveniently requires billions in subsidies, bailouts, and preferential regulations to function—freedoms that mysteriously always favor those who can afford the best lobbyists.

This linguistic sleight-of-hand performs its most important magic by convincing workers to identify with their exploiters rather than each other. When a warehouse worker making $15/hour worries about how tax increases might affect billionaires, the aristocracy's messaging has successfully created false consciousness—identification with interests directly opposed to one's own. It's like chickens voting for Colonel Sanders because he wears a nice suit and promises to "create jobs" in the poultry processing sector.

The antidote begins with reclaiming language that accurately describes economic reality:

- "Value Producers": Those who create actual goods and services through their labor • "Value Extractors": Those who accumulate wealth through ownership rather than work • "Labor Theft": The systematic underpayment relative to productivity • "Democratized Ownership": Models where workers share in the wealth they create

By developing a vocabulary that accurately names extraction mechanisms, we break the spell of terminology designed to obscure rather than clarify economic relationships. It's like putting on special sunglasses that reveal the true messages behind advertising—suddenly "Right to Work" transforms to "Right to Work for Less" and "Job Creator" becomes "Surplus Value Extractor."

## The False Binary: Capitalism vs. Communism

America's political discourse presents a false binary that would make a used car salesman blush: either embrace unregulated capitalism with its exploitation and inequality, or submit to authoritarian communism with its suppression of freedom. "Would you prefer to be exploited by Jeff Bezos or Joseph Stalin? Those are your only options, I'm afraid." This manufactured choice serves those at the top by making the current system appear as the only viable alternative to something worse—like convincing someone to stay in a burning building because it's raining outside.

In reality, both extremes fail for similar reasons—they concentrate power, merely changing which elite controls it. The supposedly opposite systems produce remarkably similar outcomes with different branding:

- Surveillance: State cameras (China) vs. corporate tracking (America)—different owners, same invasion of privacy.
- Propaganda: State media vs. corporate conglomerates—different paymasters, same manipulation of public opinion.
- Worker Alienation: Party bureaucrats vs. algorithmic management—different techniques, same dehumanization.
- Environmental Degradation: Central planning vs. profit-driven extraction—different justifications, same destroyed planet.
- Wealth Concentration: Party officials vs. corporate executives—different titles, same mansions.

This false dichotomy serves the aristocracy by making any challenge to the current system sound like advocacy for authoritarian control. It's a sophisticated version of "you can't criticize capitalism while using an iPhone"—as if participation in the only available system somehow invalidates critique of that system. It's like telling someone they can't complain about water quality while drinking water.

The third path—exemplified by Nordic social democracies—transcends this false dichotomy by balancing individual initiative with collective welfare. These systems maintain markets and private enterprise while ensuring universal provision of basic needs and democratic oversight of economic power. The results speak for themselves in measures of happiness, health, education, and overall well-being. Finland consistently ranks as the world's happiest country while Americans die from rationing insulin. Curious how that never comes up when Fox News mentions "Venezuelan socialism."

This approach recognizes both aspects of human nature: we are simultaneously self-interested and cooperative creatures. Rather than building systems that cater exclusively to either trait, balanced economies channel both impulses productively. Markets drive innovation and efficiency in areas where they function well, while public provision ensures universal access to necessities where market failures consistently occur.

The spiritual dimension of this balance cannot be overlooked. Unfettered capitalism institutionalizes our most infantile impulses—immediate gratification, hoarding, and domination—essentially building an economic system around the psychological development of a toddler. Authoritarian communism imposes external control rather than developing internal regulation. Social democracy represents a more mature approach, balancing freedom with responsibility, individual achievement with collective welfare—an economic system designed for adults rather than overgrown children with unlimited credit cards.

## The Ownership Paradox

Marx correctly diagnosed capitalism's contradictions but stumbled in his prescription like a doctor who perfectly identifies your disease then hands you poison as the cure. By proposing the abolition of private property, he created an opening for authoritarian capture—when property rights disappear, whoever controls the state controls everything. The result, as seen in authoritarian communist states, merely changed which elite held power rather than eliminating elite control altogether. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss, but with different flags and better uniforms.

The more nuanced truth lies in distinguishing between different types of property:

- Personal Property: Your home, possessions, and belongings that meet your needs—the things you actually use rather than use to extract from others.
- Small Business Property: Locally-owned enterprises where owners remain connected to operations—the restaurant where the owner still cooks, the shop where the proprietor knows customers by name.
- Extractive Property: Assets enabling wealth accumulation without labor or connection to production—the apartment buildings owned by anonymous LLCs, the patents hoarded to extract licensing fees, the algorithms that replace human judgment with profit-maximizing formulas.

The ownership paradox recognizes that humans have deep psychological needs for control over their immediate environment (the endowment effect) while acknowledging that unlimited accumulation creates system-threatening inequality. The solution isn't abolishing property but democratizing it—ensuring ownership benefits extend to everyone while preventing concentration that undermines democracy itself. It's like recognizing that medicine in appropriate doses heals while the same substance in unlimited quantities becomes poison.

This democratization can take many forms:

- Worker Ownership: Employee stock ownership programs and cooperatives that transform employees from cost centers to be minimized into stakeholders to be valued.
- Community Ownership: Land trusts and municipal enterprises that capture value for those who create it rather than absentee extractors.
- Public Option Infrastructure: Basic services accessible to all alongside private alternatives—ensuring no one goes without necessities while maintaining innovation.
- Universal Basic Capital: Ensuring everyone has a stake in productive assets, transforming the economy from one dominated by inheritance to one where everyone starts with meaningful resources.

The core insight is that ownership provides essential security, agency, and identity when distributed broadly but becomes destructive when concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. The problem isn't ownership itself but its concentration—like oxygen, essential in proper proportion but deadly in excess. By expanding rather than eliminating ownership rights, we create systems that provide both freedom and equality rather than sacrificing either on the altar of ideological purity.

## The American Dream as Control Mechanism

The American Dream functions as the aristocracy's most brilliant psychological control mechanism—transforming exploited workers into aspiring exploiters through lottery-like promises of upward mobility. "Sure, you're getting screwed today, but someday you'll be the one doing the screwing!" This narrative serves the powerful by keeping workers compliant through hope rather than demanding systemic change.

Statistical reality exposes this as largely mythology—America now has less economic mobility than most developed nations, with parental wealth being the strongest predictor of a child's economic future. A child born into the bottom quintile has only a 7.5% chance of reaching the top quintile, while a child born into the top quintile has a 40% chance of staying there. That's not a meritocracy—it's a heritable aristocracy with better marketing.

Yet the Dream persists because it serves as the system's pressure release valve—providing just enough examples of exceptional success to maintain the illusion that the game isn't rigged. Like a casino displaying giant jackpot winners while remaining mathematically guaranteed to take most people's money, the economy parades its billionaire success stories while systematically extracting wealth from the majority.

The Dream's most insidious function is transforming systemic critique into personal shame. When extraction's victims struggle despite hard work, the Dream's mythology suggests they simply didn't work hard enough, make smart enough choices, or possess enough grit. This individualization of structural problems serves the aristocracy by preventing collective action—people don't organize against problems they've been convinced are their own fault.

Breaking this spell requires replacing the lottery mentality with collective consciousness. Rather than seeing ourselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires, we must recognize our shared interest in systems that distribute value to those who create it. The alternative isn't abandoning aspiration but redirecting it toward building economic structures that reward work rather than ownership, creation rather than extraction, and cooperation rather than exploitation.

## From Understanding to Action

Understanding these extraction mechanisms is only the first step—like learning you're in an abusive relationship without yet packing your bags. Counteracting these systems requires both individual resistance and collective action:

- Financial Defense: Minimize personal exposure to extraction through debt reduction, community banking, and cooperative membership. Every dollar you keep from the extraction machine is a tiny revolution.
- Workplace Organization: Build solidarity with colleagues regardless of formal union status. Even without official recognition, workers who communicate and act collectively gain substantial power.
- Community Reinvestment: Direct resources toward local enterprises that recirculate wealth rather than extracting it. The local coffee shop recirculates 45% of its revenue locally compared to 15% for the chain store.
- Strategic Consumption: Support worker-owned businesses and ethical supply chains when possible. Your dollars are votes for the kind of economic system you want.
- Knowledge Sharing: Discuss these concepts in accessible language with friends and family. The most revolutionary act is often simply naming what was previously invisible.

Most importantly, recognize that your lived experience of economic hardship despite hard work isn't a personal failure—it's the predictable outcome of systems designed to extract maximum value from your labor. The shame belongs not to those struggling within the system but to those who engineered and maintain it. You didn't fail capitalism; capitalism is working exactly as intended—just not for you.

The liberation we seek isn't utopian fantasy but pragmatic necessity. Nordic countries have already implemented the policies we advocate, consistently producing the world's highest measures of human happiness and well-being. The question isn't whether these approaches work—they demonstrably do—but whether we can overcome the aristocracy's formidable opposition to implementing them here. It's less about inventing something new than removing the blockades preventing us from implementing what's already proven effective.

The journey continues by moving beyond understanding extraction to recognizing the sophisticated control mechanisms that maintain it—psychological, cultural, linguistic, and political systems designed to make exploitation seem natural, inevitable, and even desirable. These are the topics we'll explore in the chapters ahead, providing both the analytical tools to recognize control mechanisms and the practical strategies to counter them. Let's turn our extraction vision into action vision—because seeing clearly is only valuable if it changes what we do.
