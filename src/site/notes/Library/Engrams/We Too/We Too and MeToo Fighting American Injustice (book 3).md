# We Too and # MeToo Fighting American Injustice

You know that special feeling when your CEO announces "unprecedented profits" right before explaining why your healthcare premium is doubling? Or that warm fuzzy sensation when you realize your grandparents bought a house on a factory worker's salary while you and your partner both have master's degrees and are contemplating whether to pay rent or buy insulin this month? If these moments of late-stage capitalism give you that special tingle of suppressed rage, this book is your new best friend.

The title "#We Too" deliberately echoes the # MeToo movement that exploded in 2017 after Harvey Weinstein's decades of predation were finally exposed. What made # MeToo revolutionary wasn't just the horror of individual stories—it was the collective revelation that what many had normalized as "just the way things are" was actually a deliberately maintained system of power and control.

"#MeToo" showed us that when millions of people recognize their individual suffering as part of a larger pattern, personal shame transforms into something much more dangerous to the status quo: collective action. It demonstrated that widespread individual suffering, once connected through a shared framework, becomes an unstoppable force for accountability.

But # MeToo had a limitation—it primarily focused on sexual harassment and assault experienced predominantly by women. # We Too addresses economic extraction that affects nearly all of us, regardless of gender, race, or geography. The wealthy elite have masterfully divided us along cultural lines to prevent us from recognizing our shared economic circumstances. They've convinced rural conservatives that coastal elites are destroying America, while convincing progressives that Trump voters are the root of all evil—all while both groups watch their economic security systematically dismantled by the same forces.

Speaking of our former President—for many Americans, Donald Trump's rise represented a catalyst moment similar to Weinstein's exposure. Here was a man who inherited wealth, failed upward repeatedly, built his brand on stiffing contractors and exploiting workers, and somehow convinced millions he was fighting for the "forgotten" American. But just as Weinstein was merely the most grotesque face of Hollywood's predatory culture, Trump is merely the most shameless manifestation of America's economic aristocracy.

The real problem isn't individual monsters—it's the system that creates and rewards them. It's the legal architecture that allows billionaires to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. It's the corporate structure that treats workers as disposable while enshrining shareholder returns as sacred. It's the campaign finance system that ensures politicians serve donors, not voters.

This book isn't just analysis; it's ammunition. We'll explore how conservative power depends on maintaining contradictions that grow increasingly difficult to sustain—like the "small government" advocate who builds massive surveillance apparatus, or the "Christian values" politician whose policies make family formation financially impossible. We'll examine how these contradictions create vulnerabilities that can be strategically exploited.

"#We Too" is about transforming your individual "what the actual fuck?" moments into collective power. It's about recognizing that your struggle to make ends meet isn't a personal failure—it's the predictable outcome of a system designed to extract maximum value while returning minimum compensation. Most importantly, it's about providing practical tools to fight back against a rigged game.

In the end, just as # MeToo created lasting change by exposing systemic exploitation, # We Too can build an economy and society that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Because in a world where the deck is stacked, the most revolutionary act isn't individual resistance—it's solidarity.
