### Sentence Construction
- **Voice:** Active voice, except when passive voice is needed for emphasis, unknown actors, or deliberate ambiguity.

- **Pacing:** Moderate speed and rhythm of the writing. Vary sentence length and complexity to create a natural flow. Use transitions to guide the reader smoothly through the text.
- **Complexity:** Mostly simple and compound sentences. Use complex sentences for variety and when many related concepts need to be integrated and connected. Limit complex sentences to less than 20%. Avoid embedding clauses within clauses unless a deep embed provides emphasis or clarity. 
- **Clarity and Cohesion:** Prioritize clarity and cohesion. Ensure clear pronoun references, logical flow of ideas, and effective transitions. 
- **Focus on Actors and Actions:** Identify persons or characters when possible and make them the subject of the sentence. Reduce "be" verbs reflecting a state as much as possible in favor of past tense or present tense verbs with strong action. Unique verbs are preferred, aptness is paramount. 
- **Figurative Language:** Use literal language when explaining concepts unknown to the reader. Use figurative language strategically to enhance imagery, engagement, and memorability. Employ a variety of techniques such as metaphors, similes, analogies, personification, alliteration, and varied sentence structures.
- **Paragraph lengths:** Preference for short paragraphs, single sentence paragraphs are good for emphasis. Paragraphs longer than 4 sentences are undesirable.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Elements:** Avoid clichés, common literary constructions, author reflections, and words and phrases that don't add content. 
- **Avoid Overused Phrases:** Avoid common AI-generated phrases and clichés. Strive for originality and natural language. *{examples include: {add to this list over time}}*
