# 1 Bedtime Creation Story
A Father and Son gathered in their celestial sandbox to create worlds. Not just ordinary ones, but entire universes woven from Plancks—tiny, flickering pieces of matter and antimatter.

The Son glided on glee, his passion devoted to forging the perfect Orb of Substrate, the purest form of Plank stacking.

With nervous satisfaction, the son finishes his task under the Father’s watchful eye.

“Father,” the Son utters with cautious optimism. “I believe I made a flawless orb, forged from pure Planck’s, equal parts matter and antimatter.  His father smiled that special smile, proud but not for the achievement, for the Son’s efforts

"It looks nearly pure," the Father said gently. “Should we test it? You are master of process of Orbs of Substrate, so you can replace this one. To test it, I must make it vanish.”

“Oh No! I invested hours of effort in that Orb. It’s a big loss,” lamented the Son.

The Father reassured, “Your process is your prize. Your commitment to perfection was your compass, passion was your drive, and you manifested a pure form.”

“Outstanding!”

“Thank you, Father,” the Son said, “Let’s test the Orb. I’m ready to let go.”

Well, said the father, "I never told you this before, but matter and antimatter magically disappear when they touch. I keep them apart so you can work, but I will let them touch to test the Orb. If it’s completely pure, it will entirely disappear like it was never there! But if any imbalance remains, then a residual dust will be left behind.” 
His father removed the force, and BOOM! 

Almost everything disappeared... but not quite. Tiny wisps remained, dancing and swirling in space. The Son looked disappointed, but his Father smiled even bigger.

“Look closer,” he said. "Those tiny bits of left over matter will form an entire universe. All the stars, planets, everything they see, feel, experience, you created that.”

“When you strove for perfection, you learned a valuable new skill, and you created a whole universe, a source of joy and beauty for countless future Beings.”

“Wow!” The Son exclaimed, “When those Beings gaze at the stars, the admire the beautiful aftermath of a child's attempt to make something perfect.”
