# 2 Bedtime Creation Story
A Father and Son gathered in their celestial sandbox to create wonders. Not simple wonders, but entire universes woven from Plancks—tiny, flickering pieces of matter and antimatter, alive with potential.

The Son was propelled by passion, his fingers danced gracefully, shaping a perfect Orb of Substrate, a masterpiece of Planck stacking.
The Son’s heart raced as he placed the final symmetrical Planck, stealing a glance at the Father’s steady, encouraging gaze.

“Father,” the Son whispered, his voice quivering with hope. “I think I’ve created it—a flawless Orb, born from pure Plancks, perfectly balanced with matter and antimatter.”

The Father’s face softened into that special smile—pride not just for the Orb, but for the Son’s unwavering determination.

"It looks nearly pure," the Father said gently. “Should we test it? You are a master of the process of creating Orbs of Substrate, so you can always make another. To test this one, I must make it vanish.”

“Oh no!” the Son cried, clutching the Orb tighter. “I poured my heart into this. Watching it vanish would sadden me.”

The Father placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “The real treasure is your process. Your dedication carved the path like a compass, and your passion sparked this incredible creation. The Orb is merely a thing, a construct of Substrate, a realm of continuous change. Don’t attach to the world of forms.”

The Son gazed at the orb one last time feeling great satisfaction in its creation. He felt deep appreciation for his time with the Orb, and his sadness mixed with acceptance, that feeling that it’s okay to say goodbye.

The Son spoke, “Father. I’m ready to let go. Let’s test the Orb.”

The Father nodded. “I’m pleased,” he said, “I never revealed the secret of Plancks.”

He paused, and continued, “matter and antimatter magically disappear when they touch. I keep them apart so you can work, but I will let them touch to test the Orb.”  “Won’t it blow up?” The son said.

The father laughed heartily. 

“It will be epic! 

 If it’s completely pure, it will vanish entirely, like it was never there! But if any imbalance remains, then residual dust will linger.”

The Father carefully removed the force, and—BOOM!—a brilliant flash of light filled the workshop.

Almost everything vanished in a flash, yet delicate wisps lingered, twisting and swirling like the last whispers of a dream.

The Son’s shoulders drooped. “It wasn’t perfect,” he whispered.

But the Father laughed, a deep, warm sound that filled every corner of the workshop. “Not perfect?” he said. “Look again.”

The Son leaned closer, his breath catching as he watched something wondrous. The tiny bits of leftover matter began to weave themselves into an entire universe. Stars flared, galaxies spiraled, planets spun into being, and comets streaked through the dark.

“Those tiny imperfections,” the Father said, his voice brimming with awe, “will blossom into everything. Every star, every world, every breath of life—all born from your hands.”

The Son’s eyes glistened as he watched the universe unfurl before him, spinning and dancing with boundless energy. “Wow!” he exclaimed. “When those Beings lift their gaze to the stars, they’ll marvel at the extraordinary beauty born from a child’s imperfect hands.”

And in the infinite expanse of that celestial sandbox, the Father and Son shared a moment of wonder that echoed through the cosmos.

I am either a talented storyteller, or I may have solved the riddles of cosmic origins, replaced spacetime, found the missing baryonic matter, proven the existence of matter not directly observed, explained dark matter, eliminated dark energy, synthesized relativity and the standard model, eliminated the graviton, explained cosmic inflation, and a few others.
