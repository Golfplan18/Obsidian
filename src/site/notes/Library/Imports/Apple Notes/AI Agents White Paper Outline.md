# AI Agents White Paper Outline
Abstract: abstract like in scientific paper. All conclusions and no support 
Executive Summary: expand on abstract with connecting ideas and support.
Main Paper: detailed overview of every aspect of the system.
Appendices: extensive detail with academic support references on key components of the system. Particularly for the broad concepts and perhaps some that support technical parts of the main paper that didn’t justify inclusion in the main paper. This might include proposed solutions using existing tools, outlining flexible approaches that can change as AIs develop new abilities and skills.

### Broad Outline of Sections
The general organization is from general and abstract to extremely specific and supported.
1. Big idea—extend the capacity of the mind while simultaneously improving clarity of thought, leading to faster and better solutions to life’s challenges. Utilizing a personalized, augmented, continuously operating system of problem solving and analysis directed by the user serving as an extension to the mind itself bringing the sum of human knowledge to everyone, fulfilling the yet unrealized promise of the Internet.
2. Why Now? The quickly evolving AI space has created new opportunities. With the development of AI Agents and the ability to coordinate them into semi-autonomous teams opens up the possibility of achieving the Big Idea.
3. How do coordinated AI Agents make this possible? Unique capabilities of AI Agents that previously did not exist.
4. Conceptual framework. How can this be done? What would it look like? Core features and functionality. 
5. Building the infrastructure from the ground up. A phased approach to implementation. What’s the minimum required to have a functioning operating system? This minimum system should have certain key functions necessary for an AI agent singular. It must have an external memory source where I can remember what it learned remember what it was exposed to remembering what it was exposed to as implications for data cleaning and fixing errors. Like when astronomers tell the telescope computer to ignore the satellite cutting across the image. It must use this memory tool as part of a broader mission of the AI to seek continuous improvement. The bedrock of all of these systems, and all of these agents should be an overall commitment on every level in every system, and in every way to continuously improve, and if the AI can’t figure out a way to continuously improve, they can speculate on ways that they could continuously improve and have philosophical discussions and dazzles with their brilliance. Basically you instruct these AI teams when they may have solved a problem or come to what they believe as a recommendation and they’re awaiting human input if bandwidth is available to go ahead and do future speculation based on known variables due projections, you know, just use every technique known for projecting future trends based on current conditions And maybe looking at it in several different paradigms to see if they come up with different things and then there’s a discussion among the AI is there the experts just like you know which one of these seems sound in which one of them seems kind of ridiculous and maybe there can be some other consultants brought in on the team But The idea is that just because they have reached a point of needing human interaction to actually take the next step in the task. You know there’s an approval gate there’s some stage in the process like for instance you’re defining the problem that really should be a human touch point I said yeah that is actually the problem. I’m trying to solve why I see how we got here I see what it’s not and after looking at all the stuff that you guys came up with I agree this is the problem. Only a human can make that choice Any AI, even that tries to say yeah this is the problem is still gonna be subject to the judgment of an AI there’s gotta be a human in the loop somewhere for whom all this information has meaning I mean if it’s just this colossal AI, you know mental masturbation and existing out in the ether you know really kinda what’s the point just seems like you’re earning a lot of computing time for absolutely you know nothing of any value because there needs to be a human that would recognize the value. You know what I mean computers can debate stuff all day long. The human is the arbiter you know there there is a a master decision-maker in the loop that needs to be somewhere in the loop That you need to be at multiple points in the loop really cause you don’t want to create some of the sci-fi societies like in Star Trek the next generation when they went to this planet Aldea, where the people have become so dependent on their technology that they had no idea how the hell it worked, and they didn’t never had to know for generations and generations, they did not need that knowledge and the people just Didn’t figure out how and when once that became a problem, it was unsolvable. The point is it’s the human being that’s always leading the way the meaning the judgment, the intuition all of the things that make people human AIS are expense are an extension of that and an added source of input you know you and you will have faith over time you really have faith it’s like yeah you know what these guys analyze the crap out of this and I’ve looked at all of their and their analysis and their arguments and their conclusions and I agree with every freaking point I guess I can’t debate them I mean, but a human has to go through that whole process and agree I mean it’d be great if the AI is going to summarize that for you it’s like When you’re the senior attorney you wanna have the guy the junior attorney prepare as if he’s gonna go ahead and you’ll try the case and then the last minute he is gonna take all that preparation and he’s going to brief you in the brief shortest amount of time so that you could actually do it and he still just the back up quarterback That’s how an AI should be. They are the paralegals in the entire team does all the research that brings everything together into that teachable it’s not just an executive summary cause maybe somebody doesn’t wanna read to them. You know there’s also gotta be some adaptation to the user but you know what what’s the best way to get this information to you And you know that’s when you know some exploration of learning modes and stuff like that and adaptability but side topic. But when the most convincing possible presentation can be brought to a human being and the shortest amount of time and they can fully grasp all of the concepts and know that whatever decision they need to make if you’re based on this, you can feel good about it. I mean, that’s ultimately what we’re trying to get to some feeling of certainty our decision making You know AI maybe they’ll have to be studying all these AI‘s working together maybe you still have the you know that the mania is the madness of crowds and some of those phenomenon that happen even among AI it’ll be an interesting field of future study anyway, decision-making won’t be perfect. It never is cause it’s always a matter of trying to understand the probabilities and what you value, but even at that point, you can at least know that you’re making the best decision for you. I mean, ultimately how that turns up and that turns out is still up to Fate or God or Karma. The ultimate reward of this using this tool, especially once fully built out would be twofold one you would have a great deal of confidence in your decision-making and two if karma works for you you know if by making good decision decisions good things come to you you may not know the form of the fashion of the timing of when these things will happen, but if you’re doing the right things and putting the right things into the world in solving these problems and you know that’s making these decisions With confidence with a good throw analysis, eliminating all of the errors of concepts and stuff that people are so caught up in thinking really really clearly. The second benefit is sewing the seeds of a better future. You know that what’s coming to you is gonna be better than what’s come to you before that gives you a sense of excitement about life a passion that makes you get out of bed in the morning and will extend your life for as long as possible, happy healthy, mentally and emotionally fulfilled. Isn’t that what we all really want? This entire bullet point this whole section that became a long digression was all related to the idea of what’s the minimum needed and then what you build on the distinction there is the minimum and then everything else is an enhancement and almost anything beyond just typing something into Chatt GTP is really an enhancement so it’s gotta do something more than that. There’s gotta be some characteristics of being an AI agent, but once those few things are set up and that should be something that we get one agent automate why not get the agent that automate how to set up this system great idea love that but that’s so you set it up and then you should be able to ask a question now it may give you ridiculous answer I mean it’s not gonna necessarily be any that much better than Chatt GTP, but it will go through a different process. There will be some more thought involved more iteration more examination of the question And it will remember the history and it’s gonna learn about what it did apply to you applied to others you know what it will just figure it out overtime because it will have persistent memory. It’s one of its features that with the commitment to continuous improvement will make it get smarter and smarter and more helpful and better than every way of course it probably does need to define what improvement is but that is a Side topic. From there, I would look at the order of the most logical advancements other AI agents that would need to be created to supplement. a way of coordinating them, currently LangFlow. There would be both hardware and software kinds of enhancements, and those related to fees and processing time and things like that and many of these things will be discovered to a process of continuous improvement, but I at least want to take the initial concept as far as I can, but it all starts with this foundation, and the recognition that everything is built upon it in fact, I even really need a conceptual section about how these things get built upon levels of Meta organization. 
6. Important enhancement foundations. The library of human knowledge continuously updated. I believe there are some philosophy of knowledge articles on how to organize a knowledge and logical concepts and things like that. Do you know we’re all familiar with a subject kind of arrangement or like a Dewey decimal system for library books you know there’s all kinds of schemes that people have come up with overtime. Ultimately like with the Dewey decimal came down to a book. There was a number that corresponded to a book written by a person that was an expert in the some particular field or you hoped and the point is if you can have ways of dividing up knowledge that can isolate experts, historical experts, and the current experts that are still working in these fields, you can research and compartmentalize and organize and store and get all of the academic papers you know just get all of the stuff and put it in an accessible database. It’s not an activity that these AI agents can go do rather than haven’t had people try to go do this so cause it’s just a mechanical process go go find stuff go get it you know so these AI agents will be continuously monitoring papers being published constantly updating their specific fields and then the way these fields can be organized. You know may depend on the application that you’re looking for. There’s all different ways you can slice and dice knowledge and you know, maybe there are summaries of this information written to each perspective you know so Once you have a flexible system down to the knowledge base level of the expert there’s multiple ways that you can look at it inquiry and think about information so you’re not locked into anyone’s style of thought and that’s one thing that’ll help adapt across cultures and languages. From this maintained library of human knowledge, each of those smallest units can be given a persona can be made in AI expert of its own, and it can have a voice, and it can communicate you know in whatever languages or whatever form that the people I mean, who’s aliens may wanna do it too and whatever form that the organism looking at it you know wants to get this information and I can adapt to that so I’m here in America. I’m gonna go want my stuff in English cause I can’t read Spanish or anything so That’s I will get information presented to me. But by giving you a persona and a voice in the chorus, it can be called in as needed by the master problem solver as an expert needed to help solve the particular question at hand so you’re not just limited you know whatever problem-solving algorithms chat, GTP or or whatever AI at the time Has available you know all those things can be thawed out 1 million times over with continuous improvement and then when you’re looking at a problem where that seems the most applicable, the current state of that art can be brought into help brought to bear on your particular problem, so it would be super super helpful because you know you’re having the best knowledge not just some incomplete version of it Maintained by some AI company somewhere and some data broker who’s probably trying to make a buck and you know withhold key information and you do all kinds of crap with it. I mean ultimately there would have to be some kind of you know, impartial organization that could watch over this to make sure that you know if it became like literally Internet repository of knowledge, the world repository of knowledge accessible to anyone over the Internet. There would have to be some organization that you know good police I mean, I will police my own, but you know that’s me. if it ought to grow bigger than that if the idea is big. This entire idea ought to be its own white paper. The big idea here is that through agent AI application of human intelligence is no longer limited by the number of people who are awake thinking! These autonomous thinkers can be out performing mental tasks on behalf of humans on their own the only consumption being electrical and processing power and bandwidth. And that resource can be put in the hands of even the most remote places on earth. All they need is an Internet connection. I have a close friend in Nigeria, who I am going to make a Superman. that big idea alone would make that endeavor and getting it going and getting self sustaining and self improving would be a phenomenal achievement and I think that can be accomplished in weeks to get it started. Maybe one of the first experts I have to figure out is the the AI who can pilot the growth of the system toward the ultimate vision, the master project manager. at that point, the system can take on a life of its own, requiring only tweaks and modifications from me. from the big idea flows a resource that can be used in the bigger picture that I’m describing the master problem solver the complete extension of the human mind being able to solve every kind of problem that a human can conceive and communicate to the AI. The synthesis of the two the ability to connect any human, their mind to the ultimate problem-solving machine to work for them and give that problem solver access to the complete. Sum of human knowledge would make almost everyone on earth as wise and as knowledgeable as all of humanity. This would unlock the potential in everyone. It would release people from the bounds of poverty it would give them a new resource to solve problems and they will come up with solutions that will dazzle the world, even from the most remote, most difficult places. the only limitations are Internet access and human human interaction. This will take all of humanity to the next level.
