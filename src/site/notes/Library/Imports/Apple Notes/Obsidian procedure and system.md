# Obsidian Procedure and System
## **Updated Overview of the System**

## **System Purpose**
The system is designed to:
1. **Integrate Knowledge**:
	- Centralize expert knowledge and curated resources into a hierarchical framework for efficient retrieval.
1. **Support Problem Solving**:
	- Define problems clearly, align them with use cases, and generate actionable insights using mental models and expert analysis.
1. **Facilitate Universal Use**:
	- Provide a generalized repository of knowledge, optimized for diverse applications.
1. **Enable Personal Customization** (Secondary Priority):
	- Layer in your personal beliefs as a meta-filter for analysis and solution-building.
	- Develop a writing output module tailored to your style.

## **Key Components**
**1. Hierarchical Knowledge Framework**
- **Three-Tier Structure**:
	- **Categories → Subcategories → Specific Fields**.
	- Each level organized by subject matter, dependencies, and use cases.
- **Metadata and Tagging**:
	- Links resources to fields, dependencies, experts, and roles for efficient filtering.
- **Dependency Mapping**:
	- Forward dependencies: Fields this knowledge relies on.
	- Reverse dependencies: Fields that depend on this knowledge.
**2. Expert Database**
- **Roles**:
	- Primary: Thought Leader, Curator, Practitioner, etc.
	- Secondary: Additional supporting roles.
- **Consensus Tracking**:
	- Aligns expert opinions with scientific or field-specific consensus.
- **Dynamic Role Assignment**:
	- Adjusts role weightings dynamically based on the problem definition and use case.
**3. Problem Definition and Use Case Alignment**
- **Structured Problem Definitions**:
	- Includes type, scope, field, and desired outcomes.
- **Use Case Matching**:
	- Aligns problems with relevant roles, weightings, and methodologies.
**4. Static Document Summaries**
- **Reusable Summaries**:
	- Two formats:
		- Machine-readable markdown for ChatGPT integration.
		- Human-readable narratives for general use.
- **Pre-analyzed Resources**:
	- Include metadata, dependencies, and cross-disciplinary connections.
**5. Query and Analysis Framework**
- **Dynamic Queries**:
	- Retrieve relevant experts, data, and summaries based on problem alignment.
- **Error Correction**:
	- Flags missing data or inconsistencies and suggests corrections.
**6. Writing Output Module (Secondary Priority)**
- **Templates**:
	- Structured outputs for blogs, essays, and presentations.
- **Iterative Refinement**:
	- Uses feedback to align with your personal writing style.
**7. Meta-Belief System (Secondary Priority)**
- **Values and Beliefs Matrix**:
	- Links beliefs to core values and evaluates alignment.
- **Belief Analysis**:
	- Identifies contradictions and inconsistencies for refinement.

## **System Manual**
**1. Setting Up the Knowledge Framework**
1. Define Categories, Subcategories, and Specific Fields.
1. Establish tagging and file naming conventions.
2. Populate data storage with well-organized directories for PDFs, metadata, and summaries.
**2. Populating the Expert Database**
1. Assign experts to specific fields.
2. Document their roles, contributions, and consensus alignment.
3. Use metadata to tag forward and reverse dependencies.
**3. Problem Definition and Use Case Alignment**
1. Define the problem:
	- Identify type, scope, and field.
1. Align with a use case:
	- Match roles and weightings to the problem’s needs.
1. Query relevant data:
	- Retrieve experts, summaries, and dependencies.
**4. Generating Outputs**
1. Static Documents:
	- Create machine-readable and human-readable versions of expert summaries.
1. Analysis:
	- Apply mental models and role weightings to generate insights.
1. Writing Module:
	- Use templates to craft polished outputs.
**5. Refinement and Error Correction**
1. Validate data:
	- Flag missing or inconsistent metadata.
1. Adjust roles and weightings:
	- Refine based on feedback and problem alignment.
