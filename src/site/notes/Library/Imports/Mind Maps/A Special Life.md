# A Special Life

# Appreciating the Gift of Your Special Needs Child

## Less than Perfect

### Quote

#### "how Could anyone" by Shaina Knoll

##### How Could Anyone Ever Tell You

##### You Were Anything less than Beautiful

##### How Could Anyone Ever Tell You

##### You Were less than Whole

##### How Could Anyone Fail to Notice

##### That Your Loving is a Miracle

##### How Deeply You're Connected to My Soul...

### Do You Have a Broken Child?

#### Is Your World Crashing down around You?

#### Are Your Dreams of a Perfect Family in Tatters?

#### Do You Feel Hopeless and Full of Despair?

#### When You come to Realize Your Perfect Child Isn't what You Wanted and Expected

##### Your Life is Changed

###### And You Are Certain It's Changed for the Worst

###### But Are You Correct?

###### Are All These Gloomy and Pessimistic Beliefs and Really True?

###### What if Your Life is Changed for the Better and You just Don't Realize It?

###### Does the Mere Suggestion of This Possibility Make You Angry or Uncomfortable?

#### I Ask You to Suspend Your Disbelief

#### Let Me Show You What's Possible

### What You Will Find in This Book

#### This Book is Primarily about My Experience Raising a Young Man on the Moderate to Severe End of the Autism Spectrum

##### The Examples come from My Own Life Experience and My Years of Watching other Parents Deal with Autism

##### The Truths I Discuss Can Apply to Any Developmental Condition that Creates Special Needs

###### So while the Examples Are from Autism, the Need to Accept Your childâ€™s Condition and Find Joy in Who They Are is a Universal Truth Applicable to other Disabling Medical, Emotional Conditions

###### Downs Syndrome

###### Cerebral Palsy

###### Asperger

###### Adhd

###### Non-neurotypical

##### Autism is Somewhat Different

###### Some Children Grow out of it

###### Some Are Misdiagnosed

###### Some Are just Late Bloomers

###### The Cause is Unknown

###### Most People Have Pet Theories

###### None of Them Are Right

###### Whenever Someone Tells Me They Know what Caused Their Child's Problems

###### I Listen Patiently

###### I Accept that They Believe it

###### But I Am Equally Certain that They Are Completely Mistaken

###### Invariably, They Succumb to the Mistake that Correlation is Causation

###### There Are no effective Treatments

###### Over the Last 30 Years, Many Treatments Have Been Attempted and Studied in Detail

###### None of Them Show Any Measurable and Statistically Significant Improvement over no Treatment at All

###### Some of the Specific Problems I Describe Won't Apply to other Conditions

###### But the More Basic Truth Applies

###### You Can Enjoy a Lifetime of Love, Happiness, and Thankful Acceptance while Caring for a Special Needs Child

#### This Book is an Extended Personal Conversation between Me and You

##### I Use Many Personal Anecdotes

##### I Avoid Jargon whenever Possible

##### I Endeavor to Explain Concepts as Simply as Possible for Maximum Understanding

##### I Employ Useful Analogies

###### It May not Be Strictly Accurate

###### The Map is not the Terrain

###### There is Always More Nuance in the Details

###### The Intent is to Convey the Concept

#### This Book Isn't Something You Skim Quickly for Information

##### This Book is Emotionally Challenging

##### Understanding This Book Takes time and Contemplation

##### This Book Provides Many of Mental Disciplines I Found Useful in My Journey to Acceptance

###### I'm not Going to Ask You to Believe Anything

###### You May Wish to Take on These Mental Disciplines Yourself to Obtain the Benefits I Describe

###### Or You May not

###### I only Describe what I Know Works in My Own Life

###### Take it or Leave it

#### You May not Be Ready for This Book

##### This Book is not a Resource for Treatment Options

###### There Are to Many

###### Information Would Be Quickly Outdated

###### And so Far, None of Them Has Shown to Work

##### This Book Isn't a Recitation of the Emotional Pains of Being a Special Needs Parent

###### I Share My Stories, and Some Are Painful

###### But This Book Isn't about Sharing Pain

###### While Empathy Has It's Place, What's far More Important is what You Do to Overcome These Hurdles and Personal Suffering

###### While All Special Needs Parents Have a Unique Life Experience, We Share a Common Thread that other Parents Have Never Experienced

###### And It's Isn't All Pain and Suffering

###### In Fact, the Purpose of This Book is to Stop You from seeing it as Pain and Suffering and Learn to Appreciate the Special Joys that come with the Privilege of Being a Special Needs Parent

##### This Book Isn't about how to Transform Your Child into a Typical One

###### There is no Autism Alchemy

###### There is no Blueprint for Making Your Child Something They Are not

###### Your Child is Who He or She is

###### Resisting that Fact just Causes You and Your Child Anguish and Pain

##### This Book is not Peddling Hope for a Cure

###### Maybe Your Child's Condition May Be Treatable or Curable Someday

###### Some Children Develop Faster Later to Become More Neurotypical

###### Some Children Don't

###### Most Children Retain Many of the Traits You Currently Consider Undesirable because They Are not Neurotypical

###### The Problem is More with Your Judgment concerning Their Condition, not the Condition Itself

###### Mostly, whether or not Your Child's Development Quickens Does not Dependent upon what You Do

###### Autistic Children Are not Caused by a lack of Parental Care

###### Autistic Children Can't Be "cured" by Parental Care

###### Good Parenting Can Still Improve Your Child's Life

###### And the Core Advice of This Book to Accept Your Child is Good Parenting

###### But Good Parenting is not Going to Change Their Condition

###### Bad Parenting Can Create even More Difficult Problems because Your Child Needs Special Help

##### Most Autism Treatment Books Are not Helpful

###### For Many Years, I Read Every Book that Touted a Cure

###### There Are no Proven Treatments

###### Many Parents whose Children Improved Credit This Treatment or that One

###### But Analysis Shows that no Treatment Improves Conditions Better than no Treatment at All

###### In Short, the Improvement and the Treatment Were Coincidences without Actual Cause

###### These Stories Make Most Parents Feel like Failures if Their Child Isn't Cured

###### I Find This Message Particularly Emotionally Destructive

##### You May Need to Accept that Your Child Will not Be Cured

###### And that Doesn't Make You. A Failure

###### There Was not Something You Missed

###### My Wife Felt Guilt for Years because We Didn't Find the "right" Treatment

###### She Felt She Personally Failed Our Son

###### She Believed that if We Had just Done More Research, Tried More Treatments, Put More Time, Money, Effort into Fixing Him, He Would Be Neurotypical Today

###### She Recognizes This is Wrong Now, but She Endured This Emotional Pain of failing Our Son for Years

###### I Know Several Wealthy Families Who Poured Unlimited Resources into Treatments

###### No lack of Trying

###### No lack of Caring

###### The End Result Was not a Cure

###### The Biggest Misconception is that It's a Parent's Failure

###### It Becomes a Hidden Guilt that Never Goes away

###### Refrigerator Moms

#### This Book is for Those Who Need to Face Some Degree of Lifelong Disability

##### You May not Think This Book is for You

##### If You Are in search of Acceptance, You Found the Right Book

##### If You Are in search of Denial, You Will Need to Look Elsewhere

###### There Are a Variety of Books Promising a Cure that Will Feed Your Denial for Many Months

###### Your Sadness Will Be Kept at Bay until You Try the Treatment, and Verify It's Failure

###### At that Point, You Can Try Another Snake Oil Treatment, or You Could Do the More Difficult Work of Learning to Accept what is

##### However, if You Are Ready to Accept what is with an Open Mind and Heart, This Book May Be Exactly what You Need

#### This Book is about the Emotional Challenges or Raising a Special Needs Child and Finding Joy and Meaning in the Experience

#### This Book is a Guide to Quickening Your Journey to Love, Acceptance, and Joy in Your Life as the Caregiver for a Special Needs Child.

### Who Am I?

#### I Am Anatta

##### Not My Real Name, of Course.

###### Anatta is a Buddhist Term. It's from the Pali Language, and it means "non self"

###### The name Acknowledges the Fact that I Am not Special or Important

##### Writing Anonymously Provides Me Freedom

###### Freedom from Concerns about Self Aggrandizement

###### I Am not Trying to Impress You or Anyone Else

###### I Am not Seeking Accolades

###### I Am not virtue Signaling

###### This Isn't about Me because You Will Never Know Me

###### Freedom to Write from My Heart without Fear

###### Freedom to Utter the Truth even when it Hurts

#### I Am the Father of a Young Man with an Autism Diagnosis.

##### At the time of This Writing, He is a Young Adult

##### I've Watched Him Grow up

##### I've Grown up with Him

##### He Inspires Me

##### He Has Made Me the Man I Am Today

##### I Love Him

##### I Owe Him Everything

### My Journey of Discovery Revealed My Purpose for Being

#### The quest for Acceptance is Transformative

#### Learning to Embrace Reality Acts as a Crucible

##### Boils away Irrelevant Details

##### Eliminates Unnecessary Tasks

##### Simplifies Life

##### Provides Meaning

### The Purpose of My Life is to provide My Special Needs Son with the Fullest, Happiest, Healthiest Life Possible and Minimize His Suffering

#### His Life is Beautiful, Wondrous, and Happy.

#### I Am Living My Dream and Fulfilling My Purpose

#### I Am at Peace.

#### But I Am Capable of More.

##### I Had the Idea for This Book Years before Actually Writing it

##### In order to Take the time to Write This Book, I Had to Spend less time with My Son

##### For Many Years, I Was Unwilling to Do that

##### There Came a point when I Knew I Could Take Some time away from Entertaining Him to Accomplish Something Greater

###### It Took Longer to Write This Book because I Didn't want to Sacrifice Too much time with My Son

##### I Feel it Was Worth the Investment in time and Energy because I want other Parents Who Have Special Needs Children to Enjoy the Same or Better Quality of Life that I Have with My Son

### The Power of Compassion

#### What is Compassion?

#### Compassion is the Fervent Wish that All Beings Are Happy and Free from Suffering.

#### Compassion is a Feeling that Arises in Response to the Suffering of Others

#### Compassion is Rooted in Empathy, Our Interconnectedness

#### For Some This is a Fleeting Thought or an Interesting Philosophical or Religious Idea, but Nothing More

#### But if You Allow You Mind to Dwell on the Concept

##### A Certain Feeling Arises

##### The More You Dwell on the Feeling the Stronger it Grows

##### Dwelling on This Feeling Makes it Spread and Connect to other Ideas and Experiences.

##### If You Make it a Practice to Dwell on This Feeling Frequently

###### It Transforms Your Life

###### You Find that it Arises at Unexpected times

###### It Reforms Your Thinking

###### It Influences Your Decisions

###### It Directs Your Behavior

#### Compassion is a Strong Emotion that Becomes Stronger with Practice

#### Like Any Strong Emotion it Must Be Tempered by Wisdom to Determine Right Action

##### Compassion Motivated Me to Write This Book

##### I want to Alleviate the Suffering of Special Needs Children and Their Parents

##### I Determined that I Could Best Serve Compassion by Sharing My Experiences and Insights with You

### So why Did I Write This Book?

#### Compassion for Special Needs Children

##### My Compassion for Special Needs Children Motivated Me to Produce This Work

##### I Extended My Feelings for My Own Child to Those I Don't Know

##### My Compassion for My Son is Mixed with Attachment

##### My Compassion for other Special Needs Children is Pure

##### I've Meditated on the Sufferings of Special Needs Children Many times

###### True Stories of Horric Things Happening to Special Needs Children Are Abundant

###### Many Are Completely Helpless

###### They Can't Get Their Basic Needs Met

###### They Rarely Get Anything They want

###### Some Can't even Communicate what They Need or want

###### They Are Often Rejected by Family and Loved Ones

###### They Sometimes Are Abused and Neglected

###### They Live Lonely Lives Shunned by Others

###### They lack Social Skills, but They Have no lack of Social Desires

###### They want Friends, Lovers, Family

###### They just Can't Obtain Them

##### These Are Horrible Truths to Think about

###### But You Must See and Accept the Truth for Compassion to Be Activated

###### Most Human Atrocities Were Committed by Those Who Dehumanized Their Victims, Denied Their Sufferings, and Rationalized away Their Compassion

###### When You Contemplate These Truths, Particularly for Helpless Children, Compassion Will Arise Strongly within You

###### Out of that Compassion Will Emerge a Strong Desire to Do Something to Lessen the Suffering of Special Needs Children

###### Thus You Are Reading This Work now

###### Later You Will Be Motivated to Engage in the Emotional Work I Describe to Improve Your Life and Your Child's

###### At Least That's My Wish for You and Your Child

#### Compassion Grew inside of Me until This Book Was Bursting to Get Out.

##### The Song Lyrics that Begin Each Chapter Open Me up Emotionally

##### I Listened to These Songs on a Mix, over and over Again to Put Me in the Right Emotional State and Frame of Mind to Express Myself

##### Many of the Words Emerged through Blurry Tears of Joy

#### I want to Improve the Emotional well Being of Special Needs Children

##### Special Needs Children Are Completely Helpless

##### Special Needs Children Often Don't Get the Care and Attention They Need

##### Ignorance is not Bliss, Ignorance is Pain

##### Many Special Needs Children Endure Pain and Suffering that is both Awful and Avoidable

##### But I Can't Reach Them Directly

##### They Will not Read My Book, nor Would They Understand It.

##### I Can only Reach Them through Their Parents, through You.

#### Improving the Emotional well Being of Parents is means to an End

##### I Wish Everyone to Be Free from Pain and Suffering

##### But Parents Can Take Care of Themselves

##### I want Parents to Find Benefit from This Book

##### But More than That, I want Parents to Make Their Special Needs Children's Lives Wonderful, Beautiful, Happy, Full of Joy and Love.

#### By Writing a Book to Reach Parents,

##### I Will Improve the Lives of the Helpless Children in Their Care.

##### Possibly, I May Help the Abled Parents Too.

### Why Do Special Needs Children Need Emotional Help?

#### They Have Limited Emotional Understanding

#### They Have Limited Ability to Self Regulate

#### They Are Often Rejected by Their Parents

##### Which is a Pain that Runs so Deep It's Difficult to Absorb

##### Let the Truth of that Sink in for a Minute and Feel how Painful it is

#### Can You Feel the Suffering of Your Special Needs Child?

##### You Know Your Child, and You Are close to Them

##### You Know Their Sufferings First Hand

##### Put Yourself into Their Shoes and Feel Their Pain and Anguish

##### Don't Recoil from the Pain, but Allow it to Overcome You

###### Is Your Child Stronger than You Are?

###### Can You Bear to Take the Pain They Endure Daily?

###### Really Allow Yourself to Feel it

##### Ask Yourself how Your Child Must Feel Based on how You Interact with Them

###### Do You Look at Them and Talk to Them like They Are Broken or Defective?

###### How Would that Make You Feel?

###### Do You Get Angry with Them when They Don't Understand or Fail to Comply with Your Instructions?

###### Would You Feel Frustration in Their Shoes?

###### Would You Feel Betrayed and Alone?

###### Ask the Difficult Questions of Yourself and Be Honest with Your Answers

###### You May Find it Painful

###### But This Pain is Good for You

###### This Pain is the Root of Positive Regret

###### This Pain Will Motivate You to Change for the Better

### Why Do Parents Need Help?

#### Divorce Rate is High

##### If both Parents Reject Their Child the Stress Tears the Family apart

##### If One Parent Accepts and the other Rejects, the Stress Tears the Parents apart

##### If both Parents Accept Their Child, it Brings Them Closer

#### Parents Have to Deal with the Loss of Their Dreams

##### Vicarious Dreams of a Successful, Independent Adult Offspring

##### Loss of Their Own Independence due to Ongoing Need for Future Care

##### Worries about Their Special Needs Child after the Parents Are Gone

#### Parents Exert near 100% Control over Their Special Needs Children

##### Special Needs Children Have Limited Agency

##### Special Needs Children Need the Extra Care

#### Parents Have no Experience to Prepare Them for the Challenges of a Special Needs Child

##### Most People Don't Grow up with Special Needs in Their Household

##### Parents All want and Expect a Typical Child.

#### Parents Don't Know what They Need to Do

##### How Do Their Meet Their Child's Special Needs?

##### Have They Solved Their Own Problems?

## The End of Innocence

### Quote

#### The End of the Innocence

#### Don Henley

#### Remember when the Days Were long

#### And Rolled beneath a Deep Blue Sky

#### Didn't Have a Care in the World

#### With Mommy and Daddy Standing by

#### When "happily Ever after" Fails

#### And We've Been Poisoned by These Fairy Tales

### My Common Journey

#### I've Known My Autistic Son Was Special for Two Decades

#### I've Known Many Families with Special Needs Children, and Iâ€™ve Noticed Many Commonalities in the Experience

#### Wherever You Are on Your Journey, You Will Probably Recognize These Milestones

#### If Your at the Beginning of Your Journey, I Hope This Prepares You for what You Will Encounter, and Perhaps Avoid Some of the Pratfalls along the way

### Vicarious Dreams

#### Children Are Natural Fountains of Hope

##### When My Wife Became Pregnant with My Son, I Was Ecstatic

###### We Were in Our Early 30s, Financially Established, We Had Been Married for over a Year, and the time Was Right for Us to Have a Child

###### I Was Full of Hope for a Bright Future, Full of Love and Wonderful Family Experiences

###### Like All New Parents, We Didn't Know what We Were Getting Into, but We Believed We Were Ready for Anything

###### And We Wanted the Joy or Raising a Child, Being there for the Ups and Downs, Becoming Grandparents, and Nurturing that Relationship for a Lifetime

###### In Short, We Wanted Everything Parents Normally Get when They Have a Family

#### My Child Was Supposed to Be Perfect

##### He/she Would Have All of My Strengths

##### He/she Would not Be Burdened by My Foibles and Weaknesses

##### He/she Was Going to Be Naturally Strong, Athletic, and Coordinated

##### He/she Was Going to Be Brilliant, Naturally Adept at Learning All Subjects

##### He/she Was Going to Be Extroverted but Introspective

##### He/she Was Going to Be the Master of All Social Situations, Exemplifying virtue

##### He/she Was not Going to Make Any of the Mistakes I Did

##### He/she Was not Going to Be Typical, instead Extraordinary

##### He/she Was the Manifestation of All Good, a Special Gift to the World from God

##### He/she Would Have Perfect Motivations and not Require much Parental Guidance

##### He/she Would Have a Stellar Career with Fame and Notoriety Allowing Me to Feel Enriched by Association with Greatness

##### He/she Would Help Me Be a Better Person from Their Perfect Example of Humanity

#### Not Every Child Fulfills the Dreams of Their Parents

##### In Fact, no Child Does

##### But Most Typical Children Fail Their Parents in Predictable Ways

##### And Most Parents Fail Their Children in Ways that Their Children Overcome

##### With Special Needs, the Failures Are Catastrophic

###### The Dreams Are the First Illusions that Are Shattered

###### Acceptance is the Phoenix Rising from the Ashes

### The Warning Signs

#### There Are Signs that Something Isn't Quite Right

##### By 6 Months

###### Few or no Big Smiles or other Warm, Joyful and Engaging Expressions

###### Limited or no Eye contact

##### By 9 Months

###### Little or no Back-and-forth Sharing of Sounds, Smiles or other Facial Expressions

##### By 12 Months

###### Little or no Babbling

###### Little or no Back-and-forth Gestures such as Pointing, Showing, Reaching or Waving

###### Little or no Response to name

##### By 18 Months

###### Very Few or no Words

###### Carry around Objects for Extended Periods of time

###### Display Unusual Body or Hand Movements

###### Play with Toys in an Unusual Manner

##### At Any Age

###### Loss of Previously Acquired Speech, Babbling or Social Skills

###### Avoidance of Eye contact

###### Persistent Preference for Solitude

###### Difficulty Understanding other People's Feelings

###### Delayed Language Development

###### Persistent Repetition of Words or Phrases (echolalia)

###### Resistance to Minor Changes in Routine or Surroundings

###### Restricted Interests

###### Repetitive Behaviors (flapping, Rocking, Spinning, etc.)

###### Unusual and Intense Reactions to Sounds, Smells, Tastes, Textures, Lights and/or Colors

#### Most People Don't Jump to the Conclusion that Their Child Has Autism

##### The Possibility is Considered Too Grim to Entertain

##### Denial is Preferred to Thinking the Worst

##### Plus, not Every Child with Signs of Autism Has Autism

##### Autism Affects Every Child Differently

###### The Deficits Appear Random

###### Some Developmental Areas Are Severely Impacted and Some not at All

###### In the Rare Cases of Savants, Some Areas Are Actually well Advanced

##### Being a New Parent is Stressful Already

###### A Baby is a Huge Responsibility

###### There is much to Learn about Their Care

###### Worries about Their Mental, Emotional, and Physical Development Add to the Stress

###### Denial is Natural and Appropriate until the Warning Signs Become Obvious and Numerous

##### No One Warning Was Sufficient

##### Cumulative Warnings Painted a Picture

#### My Warning Signs

##### The Realization or Diagnosis Isn't Completely Unexpected

##### Didn't Turn over in the Womb

##### Wouldn't Roll over on His Stomach as a Baby

##### Wouldn't Make Eye contact

##### He Wouldn't Respond to His name

##### Didn't Make Vocalizations

##### He Would Stand on Tip-toes and Flap His hands

##### His Mother Always Thought His Scalp Smelled Unusual

##### He Didn't Play with Toys Appropriately

##### He Didn't point

##### He Wouldn't Look at what We Pointed to

##### He Didn't Learn by Copying

##### He Would Stand on His Toes and Vigorously Flap Has hands

### The Sickening Realization

#### I Remember the Moment I Realized My Son Had Autism

##### My Wife Was Visibly Upset

##### She Showed Me a Magazine Article that Had a List of Signs of Autism

##### When I Read the List, I Could Easily Recount Specific Examples of My Son Exhibiting Each Sign on the List

##### Before I Got to the End, I Knew Deep in My Heart My Son Had Autism

##### My Denial, My Willful Ignorance to the Truth Was Immediately Lost

###### Perhaps if the Signs Were More Ambiguous, or if I Were More Stubborn, I Might Have Sustained Denial for a while

###### But I Knew Immediately, and I Didn't Doubt it or Fight it

##### My Memory Fades at that Point, other than I Remember I Began to Cry

#### I Spent Weeks in Tears

##### My World Crashed around Me

##### My First Thoughts Were how Everything Impacted Me, of Course

##### My Dreams of the Future Destroyed

###### Rather than Celebrate My Son's Achievements

###### I Would Spend My Life Making up for His Deficiencies

###### I Would Be Tied to a Good School System, not Be Able to Move to Take Promotions

###### We Wouldn't Be Able to Travel and Enjoy Life

###### Everything Was Going to Suck from that Day forward

##### My Thoughts Turned to My Wife, and My Troubles Doubled

###### She Was Going to Need to provide Lifelong Care for Our Son

###### Her Burden Was Never Going to End

###### She Would Endure Unending Stress and Worry about Him and His Future

##### When My Thoughts Turned to My Helpless Son

###### The Pain Was so Overwhelming, I Couldn't Face it

###### My Mind Would Go Blank, and I Would Struggle to Do Anything

###### I Lapsed into Despair

#### Our Formal Diagnosis Came 9 Months after We Knew

##### This Turned out to Be a Non-event

###### We Already Knew what the Doctor Was Going to Tell Us

###### We Weren't in Suspense

###### We Weren't Shopping for a Diagnosis

###### Some People Go from Doctor to Doctor until One Tells Them what They want to Hear

###### Usually, that Their Child is less Severe than Others

##### The Most Memorable part of the Consultation Was an Unpleasant Discussion with the Doctor

###### As it Turns Out, Doctors Can Be Assholes Too

###### After Waiting Nine Months for an Appointment with the Best Reputed Specialist We Could Find

###### The Doctor Chastised Us

###### She Actually Asked "what Were You Waiting for?" to Bring in Our Son for Evaluation

###### His Signs Were so Obvious that there We Should Have Been in sooner

###### This Hurt in Two Ways

###### First, We Tried to Get in Immediately, but Her Staff Put Us on a long Waiting List

###### We Didn't Bring Him in sooner because We Couldn't

###### She Implied We Were not Good Parents because We Didn't Seek Her Diagnosis sooner

###### Second, She Used This Heartless way to Break the News that Our Child Was Moderate to Severe with Little Hope of a Neurotypical Life

###### Opportunity to Practice Compassion for an Offender

###### Before My Wife Started Crying, She Wanted to Tell This Doctor it Was the Doctor's Fault We Couldn't Get in Earlier, but She Couldn't Get the Words out through Her Sobs

###### I Was so Incensed that I Was Stunned into Silence

###### I Wanted to Tell Her She Was a Stone-cold Bitch that Should Stick to Research

###### I Wisely Said Nothing

###### But I Imagine the Look in My Eyes Expressed My Feelings

###### The Doctor Undoubtedly Thought Our Reaction Was to Our Own Guilt over Waiting, but it Was Actually in Response to Her Heartless and False Accusation of failing to Properly Care for Our Son

###### Coupled with that Jumble of Emotions Was the Stinging Realization that Our Child Was Severe Enough that His Condition Was Obvious and Undeniable

###### We Could See that Too, but We Didn't Need to Hear it Put in that way from Someone Who is Supposed to Be Compassionate and Helping

###### Getting the News of such a Bleak Prognosis Would Have Been Easier on Us if it Were Conveyed with Greater Sensitivity

###### I Had to Focus My Mind on Feeling Compassion for Her

###### My Mind Wanted to Focus on what a Complete Asshole She Was and Get Angry about the Things She Said and the way She Said Them

###### Instead, I Reminded Myself that She Thought She Was Saying the Right Things to Get My Son the Best Care

###### This Doctor Was Probably Accustomed to People Avoiding the Diagnosis to Sustain Denial, but We Were not Avoiding the Diagnosis

###### We Simply Couldn't Get in Any sooner

###### Further, Anyone Who Says Unkind Things to Vulnerable People Probably Isn't Very Happy, so I Should Feel Sadness and Compassion for Her Plight

###### It Took a Lot of Mental Discipline not to Beat Her up Endlessly in My Mind

###### My Wife Did it Anyway and Spent Years Hating Her Passionately

###### It Was not a Good Experience

##### The Diagnosis Didn't Really Change much

###### The Services We Received Did not Require a Medical Diagnosis

###### It provided a Few Additional Treatment Options, but Little in way of Substantive Help

###### We Did Some Follow-up Testing, Brain Scans and the Like, but Obtaining a Diagnosis Was not a Big Deal that Changed Anything

##### For Anyone Who Questions whether or not Their Child is Autistic, there is a much Easier way to Know, and it Doesn't Require a Doctor's Examination

###### Seek out a Parent with an Autistic Child

###### We've Lived with Autism, and We Know the Signs

###### A Parent whose Lived with Autism Has an Intuition Born of Years of Experience and Constant Immersion

###### Most Parents of Autistic Children Can Pick One out Almost Immediately

#### In Different Worlds

##### We Concluded My Son Had Autism at 18 Months

##### Once We Noticed, the Signs Became Clearer, Sharper, and even More Obvious

##### What Always Stood out the Most to Me Was how Separate Our Worlds Were

###### He Refused All Eye contact

###### Looking into Someone's Eyes is the Most Basic of Interactions

###### It's Acknowledging that Someone Exists

###### I Spent Hours Trying Different Things to Engage My Son and Get Him to Look at Me, even for a Moment

###### He Literally Would not Look into My Eyes for an Instant

###### And not just Would He Refuse to Look at Me, He Would Refuse to Acknowledge My Existence

###### Not in a Teenage way of Making a Scene about Ignoring Someone

###### But by Acting as if I Wasn't even there

###### If I Tried Talking to Him, He Would Ignore Me or Walk away

###### If I Tried touching Him, He Would Ignore My touch

###### If I Offered Him Something, He Might Take It, but He Would Do so without Acknowledgment, as if Some Object just Appeared for His Amusement with no Cause

###### I Was just Another Object in His World, and not a Very Interesting One

###### And This Went on for over a Year

##### By the time He Was Three, He Would Interact with Me, Responding to Me on Occasion

###### But He Still Had no Speech

###### In Fact, He Didn't Speak until He Was 6

###### We Had Experts Tell Us if He Didn't Speak by Age 5 He Never Would

###### They Were Wrong

###### He Had no Interest in Speech, other than to Obtain Something He Wanted, and Grunting Worked well Enough

###### He Had no Interest in Hugs or Affection

###### My Wife and I Were Useful Servants, but Little More

#### The Difficulty of a Good Life for Those with Special Needs

##### Nobody Wants to Believe Their Child Has Special Needs

##### Special Needs Persons Often Live a Hard Life Replete with Suffering

###### Their Cognitive Disabilities Put Them at a Significant Disadvantage

###### They Face Negative Judgments for Their Incapacity

###### Special Needs Persons Have Limited Abilities to Facilitate Getting Their Needs Met

###### Ignorance is not Bliss

###### Ignorance is Pain

###### Ignorance is not Knowing what You Need or how to Get it

###### Ignorance is a Life of not Getting Your Needs or Wants Met

###### They Have Limited Resources to Help Them

###### Our Capitalist System Denies Basic Resources to People to Motivate Them to Work

###### Special Needs People Have Limited Skills and Often Aren't that Productive

###### Capitalism without Compassion Would Simply Allow Special Needs People to Die

###### Even the Higher Functioning People Who Can Hold down Jobs Make Minimum Wage, Often with no Benefits

###### Special Needs People Are More Likely to Fall Victim to Predatory Lenders

###### Most Special Needs People Live at or below the Poverty line

###### Unless They Have Caring People Devoted to Them, They Don't Enjoy a High Quality of Life

###### My Son is Blessed with a Devoted and Loving Family

###### I Hope Your Child Enjoys the Same Advantage

###### But what about Special Needs Orphans?

###### A Society Can Be Judged by how it Treats It's Most Helpless Members

###### For a Highly Developed Country, Our Provision for Special Needs Persons is Lacking

###### Some States within the Us Have Reasonable Social Services

###### But even in the Best States, They Are Underfunded and Overwhelmed

###### Some Private Charities provide Assistance

###### But This is Akin to Extinguishing a Forest Fire with a Garden Hose

###### Private Charities Are Better than Nothing, but not by much

##### Complicated Sets of Rules Are Hard for Them to Follow

###### Special Needs Persons Are Rule Followers

###### They Don't Have a Depth of Wisdom from what They've Learned

###### They Don't Have High Emotional Intelligence to Understand Their Own Motivations

###### They Often lack the Empathy to Understand the Golden Rule

###### They Do Learn from the Results of Their Own Behaviors, but the Results Often Depend on what Was Reinforced and what Was Punished

###### Following Easy to Understand Rules is how They Function in a Group

###### They Are Prone to Inadvertently Violate Social Norms

###### They Simply Don't Grasp the Subtle and Unwritten Rules concerning Interpersonal Relationships

###### They Don't Read Body Language

###### They Don't Often Understand Facial Expressions, and They Must Be Taught This Skill

###### Many Don't Understand Right and Wrong, and They Can Inadvertently Break the Law out of Ignorance

###### If They've Learned Aggression as a Strategy for Getting what They Want, the Are Likely to End up in Legal Trouble

###### Many People of Color Who Have Special Needs End up Incarcerated because the Often Racist Law Enforcement Officers Will Assume Their Criminality rather than Their Innocent Ignorance

###### My Son Doesn't Have the Neurotypical Reaction to Sadness

###### He Very much Violates the Social Norms

###### In Circumstances where Most People Feel Sadness, like Death or Loss, He Laughs

###### It's like His Brain is Mis-wired to Trigger Laughter instead of Tears

###### He Can't Contain His Laughter at Funerals

###### We Had to Work with Him for Months to Get Him to Stop Laughing at the Sound of Babies Crying

###### He Isn't Motivated to Cause Pain, Fortunately

###### If He Were Sadistic and Thought Pain and Crying Were Genuinely Sources of Entertainment, We Would Have a More Serious Problem

###### But This Doesn't Appear to Be the case

###### He's not Motivated to Make People Cry in order to Laugh at Their Tears

###### I Suspect when He Feels Sadness, He is Actually Feeling the Same Emotions the Rest of Us Do, but the outward Expression is Laughter rather than Tears

###### But even if True, it Doesn't Make it Any Easier to Explain at a Funeral

###### Elaborate or Complicated Philosophies Are beyond Their Comprehension

###### They Can't Be Taught Ethical Systems with Vague Language, Nuance, and Contradictions Requiring Analysis and Wisdom

###### Special Needs Persons Aren't Trying to Live as Stoic Philosophers

###### Special Needs Persons Aren't Trying to Experience "oneness" with Others

###### Special Needs Persons Are Learning and Applying Basic Rules

###### Don't Hit, Pinch, Squeeze, or Bite People

###### Ask for what You Need and want

###### If You Don't Get what You Need and Want, Don't Hit, Pinch, Squeeze or Bite Your Caregivers

###### Beyond That, the Rules May Get More Complicated and Numerous Depending on Their Capacity, but They Are All Extremely Simple and Basic if They Are to Be Understood and Followed

##### Special Needs Persons Can Learn Basic Virtues

###### With Repeated Attention and Modeling, Special Needs Persons Can Learn to Emulate virtue

###### If Virtues Are Modeled for Them and Reinforced, They Can Become Wonderful People

###### Generosity

###### My Son Will Offer His Food and other Enjoyments to Others

###### I'm Always Pleasantly Surprised when He Offers Me Something I Know He Would rather Consume Himself

###### Loving Kindness

###### Loving Kindness is Actions toward Others Motivated by Warm Feelings toward Them

###### Acts of Giving

###### Expressions of Affection

###### Special Needs Persons Can Learn This and Revel in it

###### My Son Knows when He is Being Kind and Acting out of Love for His Family, and He Gets Very Excited about it

###### He Asks for Praise about Being a Good Boy

###### And We Heap Praise on Him to Continue Nurturing This Seed

###### I Explained on Many Occasions to My Son that the Most Important Thing He Can Learn to Enjoy His Life is to Be Kind to His Caregivers

###### It's Akin to "don't Bite the Hand the Feeds you"

###### Realistically, Caregivers Will Do whatever Their Duty Requires Them to Do or whatever They Are Paid to Do

###### However, if They Receive Kindness in Return, They Are More Motivated to Ensure Proper Care and Go above and beyond for Their charge

###### Compassion

###### This One is much More Difficult for Special Needs Persons because Many lack the Basic Understanding of Self and Other, the Basis for All Empathy

###### The Sense of Self Buddhists Work so Hard to Overcome is Needed in order to Feel Empathy

###### If You Don't Have a Sense of Self, You Have no Appreciation for the Fact that Others also Have a Sense of Self

###### Buddhists Spend the Rest of Their Lives Developing Empathy and Minimizing This Sense of Self, but They Wouldn't Be Able to Feel Empathy if the Sense of Self Didn't Arise at All

###### My Son Has Developed Compassion for His Immediate Family, but It's Still Rudimentary

###### I Know It's there because He Takes Satisfaction in Giving, Expressing Love, and Being Kind

##### Special Needs Persons Can Live an Exceptional Life

###### If They Obtain the Help They Need

###### Special Needs Persons, like Everyone Else, Are Products of Their Environment

###### They Are Often not Burdened by the Needs and Wants that Plague the Rest of Us.

###### Special Needs Persons Are Worthy of Love and Acceptance, and They Will return that Love once You Learn to Enter Their World

###### If They Are in an Environment that Supports Them and Teaches Them Virtue, That's what They Enjoy Internally, and That's what Gets Expressed when They Are out in the World

#### My Son's Nana Was His Savior

##### My Wife's Mother Was Very close to My Son

##### She Lived on Another Continent, so when She Came to Visit, She Would Stay for Months at a time

###### He Visits Were Always Welcomed

###### She Didn't Get in the way of Our Parenting

###### She Didn't Cause Strife in Our Household

###### And She Was Enthusiastically and Energetically Devoted to Our Son

###### If not for His Nana's Frequent long Visits, I Wonder if My Son Would Have Ever Desired Human contact at All

###### During that Period when He Would Ignore My and My Wife, He Would Interact with His Nana

###### I Felt Jealousy Arise at Times, but it Was Immediately Squelched by the Good I Saw come from His Budding Relationship with His Nana

##### She Would Sing to Him, Read Him Books, and Interact with Him All Day Every Day whether He Wanted to or not

###### She Was Never Dissuaded by Him Ignoring Her

###### She Was Never Put off by His lack of Social Skills

###### She Was Never Angry at Him or Critical of what He Did

###### She Was Always Loving, Accepting, and Devoted to His Care

###### If I Make Her Sound like a Saint, It's because She Was, at Least to My Son

##### She Was the First Person He Ever Felt Drawn To, Wanted to Interact with

###### She Made Him Laugh, Something My Wife and I Could Never Do

###### She Helped Him Find a Sense of Humor and a Playfulness He Still Has

###### Whenever I See My Son Laugh, or Particularly when He Gets a Devilish Grin, I See His Nana Coming through

##### I Have Many Beautiful Pictures of the Two of Them together

###### The Affection between Them Was Deep and Genuine

###### She Passed away when My Son Was 16

###### He Still Speaks of Her Often

### Despair and Your Special Needs Child

#### Children Are a Natural Fountain of Hope

##### Every Parent Has High Hopes for Their Child's Future

##### Even Devout Pessimists Harbor Secret Hopes for a Better Future for Their Children

##### Parents Often Forge Dreams of Their Child's Future Greatness in Hopes of Living Vicariously through Them

##### When You Realize Your Child Has Special Needs, These Dreams and Hopes Are Dashed

##### Many Parents Lose All Hope for Their Child

##### The Absence of Hope is Despair

#### A Special Needs Child Provides Ample Opportunities to Wallow in Despair

##### Spending time Focusing on Their Deficiencies Will Inevitably Lead to Despair

##### Since there is Nothing You Can Do about It, Any time Spent in Despair is Completely Wasted

##### Despair Drains Your Energy and Motivation and Provides Nothing in return

##### Overwhelmed by Despair

###### When I Realized My Son Had Autism, I Saw no Possible Good Could come from it

###### I Lost Hope for Myself, My Family, and My Son

###### I Accepted My Despair as My Fate

###### It Eventually Became a Sickening, Low-grade Depression

#### Redirect Your Thinking toward Thankfulness

##### Combatting Despair Requires Rigorous Mental Discipline

###### Many People Don't want to Engage in Any Kind of Discipline, Particularly a Difficult Mental and Emotional Discipline

###### Those People Remain Trapped in Despair

##### The Mind Easily and Naturally Repeats False Negative Narratives

###### It's as if the Mind Creates a Loop of Negative Thoughts and Plays it Endlessly, over and over Again

###### These Negative Thoughts Get Burned into the Mind and Heart, Unintentionally, and to the Terrible Detriment of the Person Afflicted

###### My False Negative Narratives Included Some Really Bad Ones

###### Autism Was Nothing but Bad in Every way and no Possible Good Could Ever Dome from it

###### My Life, My Wife's Life, and My Son's Life Would Be a Terrible Struggle for Ever and Ever

###### There Was no Hope of Our Lives Improving since His Autism Was Permanent

###### It Was Pointless to Consider other Ways of Looking at the Situation because I Already Knew the Awful Truth

###### These Thoughts Morph into a Quick and Nearly Silent Refrain, like Background Music

###### You Don't Consciously Realize You Are Thinking These Thoughts unless You Pay Attention to Them

###### They Fade away into Your Subconscious Mind, like a Distant Conversation You Are Trying not to Pay Attention to

##### Sometimes, These Thoughts Get Emotionally Triggered, and the Are Called to the Attention of Your Conscious Mind

###### This Will Direct Your Attention and Energize These Thoughts Emotionally

###### You Will Feel a Dose of Negative Energy and a Release of Neurochemicals that Brings You down

###### This Will Trigger other Related Negative Thoughts and Put You on the Train of Thought Leading to Pain and Suffering

##### Whenever This Sequence of Thoughts Starts, it Must Be Redirected Immediately

###### Noticing the Pattern of Thought and Choosing to Cut it off by Redirection is a Mental Discipline

###### If You Don't Engage in the Practice

###### You Will Follow that Train of Thought over and over Again

###### Each Time, it Leads to Misery and Suffering

###### The More Often You Do It, the Worse the Problem Gets

###### Your Mood is Certain to Sour

###### You Can Become Depressed or Remain Locked in Depression

##### You Need a List of Counterbalancing Thoughts You Can Rely on to Change the Narrative

###### To Successfully Redirect, You Need a Series of Positive Items to Think about instead

###### When Iâ€™ve Asked People to come up with a List of Positive Things They Could Replace Those Negative Thoughts With, Most Stare at Me with a Blank Expression

###### Their Mind's Have Been so Trained by Negativity that They Can't Conceive Anything even Remotely Positive

###### I Was Stuck in that Place, and it Took a Lot of Effort to Change it

#### My Thankfulness List for My Son's Autism

##### It Isn't Necessary to Dwell on Negative Thoughts, Particularly if there Isn't Anything You Can Do about it

###### It's Applying the Wisdom of the Serenity Prayer

###### Whenever Negative Thoughts Arise, it Should Serve as a Signal to Redirect Your Thinking toward Something Else

###### In Fact, Your Goal is to Shorten to Zero the time between when You Realize You Are Starting a Stream of Negative Thoughts and when You Apply the Redirect

###### The following Items Are Facts about My Son. However, I Refuse to Think about These Things because They Merely Trigger Negative Feelings that I Can't Do Anything about

###### His Intellectual Development is that of a 6-year Old

###### He Can't Safely Cross a Street on His Own

###### He Will Always Need 24/7 Care and Supervision

###### He Will Never Have a Wife and Family

###### He Has no Friends and Probably Never Will

###### As His Immediately Family Dies Off, He Will Live out His Life Alone

###### He Will Never Experience Many of the Things Most People Take for granted

###### Even Making This List Was Painful, and I Could Stare down the Abyss of Despair

###### They Are Facts, and I Acknowledge Them, but it Would Be Pointless and Counterproductive to Think about Them

###### If You Have a Similar List, and You Find Yourself Dwelling on These Facts, You Will Become Trapped in Despair

###### It Imperative that You Learn to Stop Thinking about These Things and Direct Your Thinking to Something Else instead

##### I Have a "go to" List whenever Some Incident or Thought Triggers Negative Thoughts and Feelings about My Son's Circumstances

##### I Have Trained Myself to Remember what I Am Thankful for even if I Am not Triggered by Some Negative Thought or Event

##### I Have General Items I Remind Myself of Constantly

###### He Loves Me Openly

###### He is My Friend and Constant Companion

###### He Talks to Me

###### He Doesn't Defy Me

###### I Have the Privilege to Spend the Rest of My Life with Him

###### He Genuinely Enjoys My Company

###### He Appreciates the Activities We Enjoy together

###### His Smile Brings Joy to My Heart

###### He is in Good Health

###### He Can Walk

###### He Can Perform Most Routine Grooming and Self-care Tasks

###### He Gives My Life and Spiritual Practice Depth and Meaning

###### I Owe All My Spiritual Growth to Him

## Troubled Water

### Quote

#### Bridge over Troubled Water

# Simon & Garfunkel

## When You're down and out

## When You're on the Street

## When Evening Falls so Hard

## I Will Comfort You

## I'll Take Your part

## Oh, when Darkness Comes

## And Pain is All around

## Like a Bridge over Troubled Water

## I Will Lay Me down

## The Painful Journey of Grief

### When You Realize You Have a Special Needs Child, You Will Grieve

#### When You Realize You Have a Special Needs Child, You Will Feel Anger, Denial, and Sadness

##### You Lost the Dream of Your Perfect, Typical Child

##### Instead, You Obtained Something You Didn't want

##### Emotionally Processing and Accepting These Truths is Grief

##### There is no Avoiding the Experience

#### How You Process Your Grief Will Determine what You Do about Your Circumstances

##### If You Lash out in Anger, and Retreat into Denial, You and Your Child Will Suffer

##### Your Need to Grieve Doesn't Remove Your Child's Special Needs

###### While You Grieve, You Will Need to Devote Yourself to Meeting Your childâ€™s Needs

###### Helping Your Child is not a Distraction or a Burden

###### It's Actually the Path to Your Recovery

##### With Help, You Can Shorten the Process

###### Avoid Depression

###### Find Meaning and Joy on the other Side

###### And in the Process, Better Serve Your Child

#### We All Process Grief Differently

##### While the Process of Grief Can Be Described in General Terms, Each Person Find Their Own Path through Grief

##### I Try in This Work to Guide You to a Quicker and less Painful Path by Pointing out the Pitfalls on the Journey, it Doesn't Mean that the way I Describe is the only way or the Best way

##### By far the Most Common and Most Harmful Thing You Can Do with Your Spouse is to Judge and Criticize Them for how They Handle Grief

#### To Meltdown or not to Meltdown, that is the Question

##### If both Spouses Become Overwhelmed with Grief, it Needs to Be Brief for the Family to Still Function

###### It This Leads to a Catharsis and Quick Recovery, This May Be a Better Method as Each Spouse Can Process a Great Deal of Grief Quickly by Crying it out

###### If it Leads to a Prolonged Period of Deep Mourning, it Can Lead to Depression Which Helps Nobody

###### If both Parents Are in Full Meltdown Mode and Withdrawing from the World, Who is Taking Care of Their Special Needs Child?

##### If neither Spouse Melts Down, They Can both Process Their Grief while Doing What's Necessary for Their Family

###### This Happenstance is Certainly Easier on the Parents and the Child, but if One or both Are in Denial, it Isn't Leading to Acceptance

###### My Wife and I Were Fortunate in that We both Processed Our Grief This way

###### We both Were Very Sad and Cried Often, but We Didn't Succumb to Feelings of Overwhelm or Withdraw from the World, and We Mutually Supported Each other

###### Neither of Us Became Depressed, though the Sadness Took Many Months to Pass

###### Neither of Us Looked Own in Righteous Judgement at the Poor way the other Handled Our Situation

##### If One Spouse Melts down and the other Does Not, both Are Prone to Judge the other Negatively

###### When One Spouse Feels the News is Too much to Bear and Completely Melts Down, They Do so with the Full Expectation that the other Spouse Should Feel the Same

###### The More Emotionally Distraught Spouse Will Claim the other is in Denial, Unfeeling, and Should Be just as Distraught at They Are

###### The less Distraught Spouse Will Claim the other is a Weak Snowflake that Needs to Get over it and Get on with Life

###### As Each Spouse Hardens in Their Respective Positions, Animosity Builds between Them

###### This is One of the Prime Contributors to the High Divorce Rate among Special Needs Parents

### How Your Mind and Heart Process Grief

#### Stages of Grief Traditional Interpretation

##### Linear Progression from One Stage to the next

##### Does not Explain why These Stages Occur

##### Does not Reflect the Recursive Nature of Grief

##### Does not provide a Conceptual Reasoning for why the Process Unfolds as it Does

##### Does not Mention that Bargaining is Actually a Form of Denial

##### Reality is More Complex and Chaotic

#### The Mind Judges Every Thought and Experience

##### Pleasant, Unpleasant or Neutral

###### The Natural Reaction is to Pull Toward, Push Away, or Ignore

##### All Thoughts and Experiences Carry Emotional Content

###### Mostly These Are not Strong or Intense and Are Barely Noticeable

###### But Sometimes, These Thoughts and Experiences Are Powerful

###### The Emotional Reaction to Judgment Can Be Lessened with Intentional Practice

###### We Can Learn to Reduce the Certainty of Our Judgments to Reduce the Impact

###### We Can Learn to Reduce the Importance We place on Our Judgments to Reduce the Impact

###### Reducing Certainty and Importance of Judgments Lessens the Highs and Lows that Disturb Peace of Mind

##### The Mind Doesn't just Think These Thoughts once

###### The Mind Will Put Thoughts and Experiences on Loops and Play Them back over and over Again

###### If an Experience is Emotionally Powerful, the Mind Doesn't want to Forget it

###### These Loops Are Constantly Playing in Your Subconscious Mind

###### The Cumulative Effect of All These Emotional Feedback Loops Playing in Your Mind is Your Mood

###### These Tend to Be Dominated by Our Negative Experiences

##### When You Have a Strongly Emotional Experience

###### Your Mind Creates a Loop and Plays it back over and over Again

###### It Amplifies the Effect

###### It Determines Your Moods and State of Mind for long Periods

###### When the Experience is Negative, it Can Lead to Depression

##### The Mind Tends to Focus More on Negative Feelings and Experiences

###### Survival Instinct to Avoid Danger, Hunger, Pain

###### It Requires Mental Discipline and Training to Focus on Positive Feelings

#### Our Mental Judgements Create Negative Feelings

##### Which is why Non-judgement is a Profound Spiritual Practice

##### There Are Three Events that Carry Negative Feelings

###### Failure to Obtain Something You Wanted

###### Getting Something You Didn't want

###### Losing Something You Had

##### These Events Are Very Common and Occur Thousands of times a Day in Varying Degrees

##### This Negative Feeling is Automatic and it Generates Sadness

##### The Depth of Sadness is Directly Related to the Degree of Desire and Attachment

##### The Natural Reaction to Negative Feelings is to Push Them away with Anger

##### A Secondary Reaction is to Avoid Them, Ignore Them, or Deny the Feelings Exist

#### Learning to Accept what is

##### Acceptance is the Emotional Clearing of the Negative Feelings Generated by the Loss of Attachment

##### Anger and Denial Are Easy and Natural

###### Unfortunately, They Are also Harmful and counter Productive

##### Embracing Sadness Must Be Chosen

###### The Reaction is not Automatic

###### Embracing what Feels Negative is not Instinctual or Intuitive

###### Trained by Spiritual Practice

###### Cultivating the Belief that Sadness is the Path to Wholeness and Healing

###### A Decision to Drop All Resistance to what is

##### Embracing and Enduring Sadness is how People Accept whatever Happens in Life

### Grief is the Processing of Anger, Denial and Sadness

#### Acceptance is a return of Joy and Happiness

##### Not in spite of what Happened

##### But because of what Happened

##### Acceptance is the State of Mind where You Are no Longer Disturbed by the Three Emotions of Anger, Denial, and Sadness

##### Life Need not Be a Series of Disappointments that Accumulate into Depression

###### But This Exactly what Happens when People Don't Grieve Properly

###### Many People Live in a State of Low-grade Depression

###### Constantly Fighting off Sadness through Anger, Resistance, Denial and Bargaining

###### Suppression Doesn't Succeed

#### Grief and Forrest Gump

##### If You Have a Special Needs Child, the Movie Forrest Gump Will Disturb You Emotionally in Wonderful Ways

##### The Movie Artfully and Poignantly Illustrates the Difficulties and Possibilities of a Life with Special Needs

##### There is a Scene after Jenny Leaves Forrest where He is Overcome with Grief and Starts to Run

###### He Runs across the Country and Keeps Running

###### He Runs for Years and Gains a Cult following

###### He Isn't Fully Aware of why He's Running, He just Feels Compelled to Run

###### He Has no Agenda, no Political Statement, no Desire to Influence Others

###### Viewers Have the Context of the Movie, and We Knew He Was Running from His Grief over the Loss of Jenny from His Life

###### What Nobody Knows, even Forrest, is how much Grief He Has to Process and how long He Will Need to Keep Running

##### At Some Point, He's Run through His Sadness and He Simply Stops Running and Announces He Wants to Go home

###### Such is the way of Processing Grief

###### Nobody Knows how much Sadness They Have to Digest

###### Nobody Knows how long it Takes

###### When It's Over, Your Mind just Stops Thinking about It, and It's over

##### This Running Sequence in the Movie is a Great Analogy for Processing Grief

#### The Swimming Analogy

##### The Journey to Acceptance is like Embarking on a long Distance Swim in Turbulent Water

##### Water is Symbolic of Emotions

###### The Water Can Be Turbulent and Difficult to Swim in

###### Drowning in Emotions is a Depression

##### The Length of the Journey is Based on how much Sadness You Need to Endure to Reach Acceptance

###### When You Start, You Often Can't See the Distant Shore

###### You Feel like You Are Entering an Abyss or an Endless Ocean

###### There is an opposite Shore of Complete Acceptance

###### It Often Takes Faith to Start the Journey

##### Denial and Bargaining Are like Islands of Respite along the Journey

###### If You Don't Stop at an Island to Rest, You Will Drown in Depression

###### If You Stay Too long on an Island or Mistake it for the Shore of Acceptance, You Never Reach Solid Ground

##### The Journey to the Shore of Acceptance is a Grueling Swim through an Ocean of Sadness with Brief Respites in Islands of Denial

## Angry Young Families

### Quote

#### Angry Young Man - Styx

#### And You're Fooling Yourself if You Don't Believe it

#### You're Kidding Yourself if You Don't Believe it

#### Why Must You Be such an Angry Young Man

#### When Your Future Looks Quite Bright to Me

#### How Can there Be such a Sinister Plan

#### That Could Hide such a Lamb, such a Caring Young Man

### The Perils of Anger

### Anger is a Unpleasant Feeling Generated by a Negative State of Mind

#### How Anger Arises

##### Anger is One of the Most Common and Easily Recognizable Disturbances of Mind

###### Anger is not Subtle and Leaves no Doubt about It's Presence

##### Anger Requires Focus on a Particular Person, Object, or Event

##### The Angry Person Judges that the Person, Object, or Event Undesirable or Unattractive

###### In other Words, it Becomes a Problem Requiring Action or a Solution

##### The Angry Person Focus Exclusively on the Negative Qualities of the Identified Cause and Exaggerates it to the Complete Exclusion of Any Good or Counterbalancing Features

##### The Angry Person Blames the Object, Event or Person for Causing the Negative Circumstances Taking no Personal Responsibility for the Anger

##### The Angry Person Fosters a Desire to Resist, Harm, or Push away whatever Was Identified as the Cause

#### The Desire to Resist, Harm or Push away is the Common Feeling We Recognize as Anger

##### Three Common Events that Generate Sadness Lead to Anger

###### Because We Wish to Push away the Sadness

###### Failure to Obtain Something You Desired

###### Getting Something You Didn't Desire

###### Losing Something You Desire that You Already Had

###### These Events Occur Thousands of times a Day in Varying Degrees

###### The Good News is that Every Occasion for Anger is an Opportunity to Practice Acceptance and Grow Spiritually

##### The Feeling of Anger is Actually a Bi-product of a Mental Process

###### It Happens so Quickly and so Instinctively that People Don't Recognize there is a Process behind it

###### Since it is Caused by a Mental Process, there Are Many Ways to Break the Pattern at Any of the Steps Identified and Stop that Process from Moving forward and Generating Anger

###### This also means Each of Us is 100% Responsible for Our Own Anger

##### Through Engaging in the Practices of Acceptance, Non-retaliation, and Forgiveness, Anyone Can Overcome Anger, and it Will Eventually not Arise at All

### Most People React to Loss with Anger

#### Anger is Easy

##### Anger Arises without Any Help or Discipline

##### As with Most Things that come Easily in Naturally in Life, Anger is also a Huge Liability

#### Anger is Resistance to Sadness

##### Anger is Your False Protection against Sadness

###### False because the Sadness Can't Be Avoided

###### Anger is the Biggest Hindrance to Getting through the Grieving Process

#### Anger Provides False Assurance

##### Anger Feels Strengthening

###### When You Are Angry, Your Body Secrets Adrenaline

###### The Fight or Flight Response is Useful in Emergencies

###### As a Chronic Condition, it Poses Many Health Problems

##### Anger Can Be Forged into Determination

###### Determination in Response to Anger Feels like a Gun to Your Head

###### Anger is a Response to Environment Threats, and It's not Suited for Continuous Consumption

### Anger is not Caused by the outside World

#### Most People Believe Anger is not Their Responsibility

#### People Blame Exterior Circumstances

##### Many Believe the Behavior other People Causes Their Anger

##### They Believe outside Events that Triggered Their Anger Was Responsible for Their Anger

##### The Truth is the opposite

###### Anger is not Caused by other People or Their Behavior

###### Anger is not Caused by the Event

###### Anger is not Unavoidable or Uncontrollable

#### People want to Believe They Are not Responsible for Their Anger

##### That Let's Them Avoid the Remorse over Their Actions under the Influence of Anger

##### The Reasoning is that if They Are not Responsible for Their Anger, They Can't Be Held Responsible for what They Do when They Are Angry

###### Unfortunately for Them, the opposite is True

##### It's a Convenient Lie Angry People Have Relied on since the Beginning of time

#### The First step to Overcoming Anger is to Recognize that Anger is 100% Your Responsibility as You Are the only Cause of Your Own Anger

### Don't Blaming Others for Your Anger

#### The Habit to Judge and Blame is a Source of Anger

##### Some People Evaluate Every Interaction with Another Person

###### They Assign Blame for Any Perceived Misdeed

###### Though Often, They Don't Bother to Assign Praise and Remember the Good

##### They Record This Blame Mentally in an account of This Person's Character

###### This Mental Ledger of Slights and Misdeeds Becomes Useful Ammunition during a Future Angry exchange

###### This also Becomes Fodder for Feelings of Jealousy

#### Blaming Others for Our Anger Ostensibly Negates Our Responsibility for it

##### The Ego Never Likes to Take Responsibility for Anything

##### Human Nature is to Deny Personal Responsibility and Look for External Events or People to Assign Blame to for Our Misfortune

##### Most People Don't Recognize or Accept that They Are Solely Responsible for the Anger They Experience

##### To Dodge Responsibility for Our Own Anger, We Assign that Responsibility to Others

###### This Makes it Relatively Easy to Sustain Anger as well

###### We Merely Have to Recount the Reasons for the Other's Responsibility

#### Assigning Blame and Recording the Reasons Sustains Anger, Creates Enemies, and Hardens into Resentment and Hatred

##### Assigning Blame is the Necessary First step

##### If You Don't Assign This Blame, and instead Take Responsibility, the Anger Dissipates and Eventually Goes away Entirely

##### This Prevents Resentments from Building

##### This Stops from Gaining New Enemies and People to Hate

#### Even if the Actions of Another Cause Us Harm, We Shouldn't Blame Them and Sustain Anger

##### Someone that Practices Patience and Harbors no Ill Will toward Anyone Has no Enemies and is less Likely to Be a Victim of Harm by Another

##### Even if Harmed by Another, a Spiritual Practitioner Would Seek to Feel Compassion for Their Assailant Recognizing the Strong Delusions that Motivated Their Behavior

###### This Isn't Easy, but it is Necessary

##### Justifiable Anger is the Hardest to Overcome

###### The Justifications May Be True and Accurate

###### The Anger May Be Completely Warranted and Understandable by Everyone

###### But Feeling and Sustaining that Anger is Still Carries All the Negative Side Effects of Anger

###### Justifiable Anger is Still Anger that Must Be Abandoned

#### Don't Play the Blame Game

##### You Are not Everyone's Judge and Jury

###### Your Judgments Are Probably not Accurate as You Don't Have All the Information

###### Let He Who is without Sin Cast the First Stone

###### Jesus Christ, John 8:7

##### Assigning Blame and Keeping Accounts of Negative Actions Has only Negative Benefits

###### It's Useful for Emotional Retaliation during Heated Arguments in an Attempt to Manipulate Their Behavior to Conform to Our Wishes

###### And It's Useful as a Basis for Jealous Retaliation and Diminishing Others in Our Mind

###### Neither Activity is Virtuous or Beneficial to Others or Our Relationships with Them

###### If You Don't Record the Blame, You Won't Engage in the Negative Activities that Require that Information

##### You May Still Make Note of Someone's Character and Desirability for Interaction

###### You Still Make Judgments about whether or not You want to Allow People into Your Life

###### There Are People I Prefer not to Spend time With, but I Don't Have Any Anger toward Them

###### I Feel Compassion for Their Delusions

###### But I Don't want to Get Caught up in Their Delusional Dramas

##### The Blame Game is about Sustaining Anger through Remembering Specifics about Negative Judgments and Using that Material for Later Hurtful Actions

### Anger and Your Special Needs Child

#### When I Realized I Didn't Have a Typical Child, I Got Angry

##### I Didn't Get Something I Desired

##### I Lost Something I Thought I Had

##### And I Got Something I Didn't Desire

##### I Hit the Trifecta of Anger Inducing Events

##### And it Was about Something Really Important, My Family

###### Which Made the Anger even Worse

##### I Focused on the Condition, Judged it Negatively, Resisted the Truth, and I Wanted to Change It.

###### In Short, I Created All the Conditions Necessary for Anger to Arise

#### I Looked for People to Blame for My Problem

##### I Ignored My Own Family History or Potential Causes

###### Because there Was no way I Was Going to Take Responsibility of Any of This

###### I Secretly Knew I Was Perfect and Blameless

###### Or at Least that Was the Nonsense I Told Myself

##### I Must Have Been My Wife's Fault

###### She Had Terrible Genes

###### She Ate the Wrong Foods when She Was Pregnant

###### For no other Reason, it Had to Be My Wife's Fault because there Was only Me and Her, and it Wasn't Me

###### Angry People Don't Mind Being Assholes, and I Was no exception

##### Some People Suppress It, Deny It, or Try to Ignore It,

###### I Didn't Bother with the Diversions. I just Became Very, Very Angry

#### Anger with a Spouse is a Common First Reaction

##### Some People React like Me and Blame Their Spouse Directly

##### Some People Don't Blame Their Spouse for the Problem, but They Get Very Angry about Their Spouse's Response to the Circumstances

###### Everyone Reacts to Tragedy Differently

###### Some People Accept it Quickly

###### Some People Completely Fall apart and Lapse into Despair

###### Some People Lapse into Denial and Act as if Nothing Happened

##### If both Parents Have Different Reactions, One Parent Will Often Get Upset with the other for the Difference

###### If One Parent Falls apart while the other is Strong

###### The Strong One May Get Upset with the Distraught One for Being Weak

###### The Distraught One May Get Upset with the Strong One for Being Uncaring and Having no Empathy

###### Each One Becomes Certain Their Reaction is the Correct One and the other Parent Must Be Wrong and Defective

###### The Negative Judgment and Condemnation Creates Marital Strife at a time when the Couple Needs Unity

###### Parents Will Reach out to Their Support Groups for Confirmation that Their Reaction is the Proper One and the other Parent is Wrong

###### The Parents Will Argue and Fight and Create Animosity that Hardens into Resentment Which Drives a Wedge between Them

###### If both Parents Fall apart or Lapse into Denial

###### Even if there is Congruity between the Parents with Their Response, it May not Be Helpful for Their Child

###### If They Are Unified in Their Denial, They Won't Seek out Proper Assistance and Treatment

###### If They Are Unified in Their Despair, They Will Become Depressed as Each One Feeds on the Negativity of the other

#### Some People Get Angry at Their Child

##### Obviously, a Child Didn't Have a Choice in the Matter, but that Doesn't Stop People from Directing Anger toward Their Child

##### I Didn't Fall into This Trap, Partially because I Knew He Didn't Choose It, but Mostly because I Had My Wife as a Better Target for Blame

#### Some People Get Angry at Their Parents

##### They provided Those Messed up Genes that Caused This Problem, Didn't They?

##### Did They Dole out Too much Junk Food Growing Up, Poisoning Me and Ultimately My Child?

##### Maybe Their Generation Poisoned the Environment and Created This Problem?

###### This is My Pet Theory, Based on no Actual Evidence

##### Personally, I Didn't Spend much Energy Being Angry at My Parents

###### Since I Was Taking no Personal Responsibility, I Didn't Need to Deflect Any of that to My Parents

###### If I Had Felt Any Personal Responsibility, I Would Have Likely Scapegoated Them

#### Some People Get Angry at God or Fate

##### For Those Who Practice a Devotional Religion, This is a Real Problem

###### Of Course, They Will Deny it Outwardly, but Inwardly, They Will Be Angry at God

###### God Provides an Easy Target for Anger with Circumstance

###### Why Did God Give Them This Problem?

###### What Sin Did They Commit that Warranted This Punishment?

##### I Got Angry at Life or Fate

###### I Didn't Look to God to Focus My Anger upon

###### Not because I Was above Doing so

###### But because I Was not a Believer

###### I Raged against My Bad Fortune

###### I Knew about Karma

###### I Could Have Taken Responsibility

###### I Could Have Accepted it Was due to My past Misdeeds

###### But I Wasn't in a Mood to Accept Anything

###### I Misunderstood Karma at the time

###### Some Cultures Posit that a Special Needs Child is a Punishment for Sin or Some other Previous Transgression

###### Of Course, This Presupposes that Have a Special Needs Child is Bad and Therefore You Must Have Done Something Bad to Deserve it

###### I Accepted This Erroneous Interpretation

###### When You come to Realize Your Special Needs Child is a Blessing, You Begin to Wonder what Great Deed You Did in Your past to Deserve such an Honor

###### If I Had a past Life, Perhaps I Failed to Achieve the Spiritual Growth I Desired and Longed for Something More

###### Having a Special Needs Child Has Made Me a Better Person, Forced Me to Grow in Spirit, and Improved My Life in Immeasurable Ways

###### I now Realize I Must Have Lived a Life of virtue to Have Earned such an Honor

#### Where Did All that Anger Go?

##### For Many Years, I Stuffed it away inside

##### It Burned as a Secret Resentment for Many Years

##### It Changed over time as My Understanding Grew

###### But it Wasn't until I Saw My Child as a Gift that it Fully Went away

#### If You Felt Any or All of Those Things, You Are not Alone

##### If You Didn't Feel Any of Those Feelings, You Are either a Saint, or so Deep in Denial that You Are Lying to Yourself

##### Everyone Goes through This to Some Degree

##### Hopefully, You've Recognized the Silliness and Futility of Anger and Blame

###### If You Have not Overcome Your Anger, You Have Emotional Work to Do

#### The Important Thing is what You Do with that Anger and how You Move past it

### Resentment and Your Special Needs Child

#### When You Found out Your Child Was Special, if You're like the Rest of Us, You Got Angry

##### Where Did that Anger Go?

##### Is it Completely out of Your Heart, or is it Hiding in Some Forgotten Recess?

##### Anger Sustained for the long Term Hardens into Resentment

#### Do You Resent Having a Special Needs Child?

##### I Did for about 16 Years

###### It Was Hidden in the Background

###### And I Would Profess not to Be

###### But I Was

###### I Felt Burdened, Held back from Great Accomplishment

###### I Was a Fool

#### Do You Resent Your Child for Being Special and Needing Your Help?

##### Parents Expect Their Children to Achieve Independence, Move Out, and Allow the Parents to Live Separately as Grandparents Someday

##### When a Child Can't Achieve Independence, the Parents Are Saddled with This Responsibility for Life

##### That is My Circumstance

##### The Reality of Lifelong Dependency Breaks One of Three Ways

###### The Parents Grow Resentful of the Lifelong Burden, Often Seeking Institutional Care to Be Relieved of the Burden

###### They Grimly Accept Their Duty and Take Care of the Child for Life, Secretly Resenting Their Burden but Carrying on

###### This Group Sometimes Gets Prideful and Self-congratulatory with Their Martyrdom

###### Or They come to See it as a Blessing, Something They Are Honored to Do and Thankful for the Opportunity

###### This is the Fate Iâ€™ve Chosen

###### Which One Will Be Your Fate?

#### Almost Nobody Will Publicly Admit to Feelings of Resentment, but They Harbor Them Anyway

#### If You Have not Fully Accepted Your Special Needs Child, You Are Harboring Some Hidden Anger and Resentment

##### Until You Feel This Resentment and See it for what it Is, You Will not Rid Yourself of it

##### Once You Realize It's There, You Can Practice Forgiveness and Acceptance to Make it Go away

### Nothing Good Comes from Anger

#### Anger Disturbs Your Peace of Mind

#### Anger is not a Pleasant Feeling

#### Anger Compels You to Hurt other People

##### Hurting Others Leads to Regrets

##### Anger is the Direct Path to Lifelong Regret

#### Anger Fills Your Mind with Toxic, Negative Thoughts

#### Anger Elevates Your Blood Pressure and Leads to Heart Disease and other Health Problems

#### Anger is Ultimately Self-defeating

### Many People Feel Anger and Go Directly into Denial

#### Denial is less Painful

#### Some People Believe They Can Get to Acceptance through Avoidance

##### Avoidance Doesn't Purge the Negative Thoughts and Feelings from Your Mind

##### It Merely Pushes Them out of Consciousness

##### The Diagnosis, that Thing You Are Trying to Avoid, is Still Firmly Rooted in Your Mind

##### This Weed of Negativity Takes Over, Destroys Your Mood, and May Cause Depression

## Reasons to Believe

### Quote

#### A Reason to Believe

# Rod Stewart

## If I Listened long Enough to You

## I'd Find a way to Believe that It's All True

## Knowing that You Lied

## Straight-faced while I Cried

## Still I Look to Find a Reason to Believe

## The Bitter Taste of Denial

### Denial is Willful Ignorance

#### Denial is a Chosen Ignorance to Avoid the Pain of Reality

##### Something is True, and You Subconsciously Know It's True, but yet You Refuse to Believe it

###### If the Knowledge of the Truth Weren't Being Consciously Ignored or Suppressed, it Wouldn't Be Denial

###### Suppressing Those Lingering Suspicions that You Don't want to Acknowledge is Denial

###### Denial is a Willful, Conscious Ignorance and Rejection of Reality

###### People Who Are Skilled at Denial Won't Consciously Realize They Know

###### They Claim an Uncertainty or that They Are Suspending Judgment

###### They search for Confirmation of Their Uncertainty and Evidence Contrary to Reality

##### Unfortunately, Denying Reality Does not Change Reality

##### Ignorance Leads to Poor Decisions

###### The Decision is Made on a Faulty Basis

###### If You Deny a light is Red when Passing through an Intersection, You Could Be in an Accident Harming Yourself and Others

###### Denial is the Cause of Many Premature Deaths as People Ignore the Early Warning Signs of Disease until It's Too Late for Treatment

###### Denial with a Special Needs Child Usually Entails failing to Get Proper Assistance Thus Harming the Helpless Child

#### My Denial Was short Lived

##### My Denial through My Son's First 18 Months Were Willful Ignorance

###### The Signs Were Obvious and Numerous

###### When My Wife Showed Me a List of Signs for Autism

###### I Immediately Knew it Was True

##### I Couldn't Muster much Denial after the Moment of Realization

###### My Reality Didn't Leave much Room for Doubt

###### My Son Was Severe Enough that the Ray of Hope that People Expand into Full-blown Denial Was not Available to Me

#### Denial is an Emotional Safety Measure Helpful in Avoiding Depression

##### Denial Has One, and only One, Useful Function

###### When the Emotions Become Too Intense, Too Difficult or Too Prolonged, Your Mind Will Find a way to Lapse into Denial

###### It Usually Resorts to Bargaining

###### Bargaining is a Form of Denial where You Believe that Some Action Will Make the Undesirable Problem Go Away.

###### Bargaining and Denial provide a Welcome Respite from Processing Sadness

##### However, it Needs to Be a Temporary Pause, a Rest Stop on the Journey.

###### When Someone Has Lapsed into Denial, They Aren't Making Progress on Their quest for Acceptance

#### Snake Oil Treatments and False Hopes Have Their Roots in Denial and Bargaining

##### Grasping at Miracle Cures is a Common Form of Bargaining

##### It Can also Be a Tremendous Waste of Resources

##### There is no Cure

### Denial and the Special Needs Child

#### Reality is Deemed to Be Too Difficult to Accept

##### Denial Seems to Be the Easier Road to Travel

##### The Pain of Acceptance is Too Great

#### My Child Does not Have Special Needs

##### Denial is a Mechanism to Avoid the Pain and Sadness of Acceptance

##### Some People Would rather Be Impervious to Reality than Feel Any Pain

##### One way Parents Sustain Denial is by Refusing to Seek a Diagnosis

###### An Objective Opinion from an Expert is Hard to Deny

###### Which is why People Avoid it

###### It's also why the Doctor Chastised Us as She Was Probably Tired of seeing People well after the Signs Were Obvious

###### At Least That's what I Kept Telling Myself

###### The Result Refusing to Obtain a Diagnosis is Often a lack of Proper Medical Care

###### That's not Doing the Right Thing for the Child

##### Refusing to Seek Government Assistance

###### You Don't Need to Fix a Problem You Don't Have

###### If You Deny You Have a Problem, You Won't Bother Seeking out Assistance for it

###### Some People Are Philosophically Opposed due to Their Political Beliefs

###### Your Family and Your Child Pay a High Price for This

###### When My Son Was Young, We Didn't Apply for the Assistance Programs We Were Eligible for

###### My Wife Did not Work because My Son Needed 24/7 Supervision

###### My State Offers Payment for This Service as In-home Care

###### I Carried the False Belief that My Obtaining Assistance Was Taking it from a More Deserving Family

###### Also, I Didn't Feel I Needed it because I Was a Good Provider

###### My Ignorance, Arrogance, and Stupidity Cost My Family Thousands of Dollars a Month in Aid and Services for My Son

###### I Didn't Apply for One Important Program for Nearly 10 Years after We Were Eligible for Help

###### The Opportunity Cost in Lost Assistance to My Family Was well over $100,000

###### I Put My Family through Unnecessary Hardship due to My Failure to Seek the Proper Assistance to Which We Were Entitled

###### I Feel Strong Remorse over My Bad Decision Making

###### Please Don't Make the Same Mistake I Did

###### The Result Denial is a lack of Financial Assistance or Support Services

###### My Wife Did not Work so that She Could provide My Son the Care He Needed

###### The Loss of Income Could Have Been Made up for by State Assistance

###### This Can Be a Significant, Life Changing Amount

###### And even if Your State or Country Provides Little or no Support, Anything is Better than Nothing

#### My Child Doesn't Fit under that Label

##### Labels Are Harmful as They Cast an Identity that Can Be Difficult to Overcome

###### Nobody is a Label

###### Labels Create Limitations that Are not Real

###### But a Diagnosis Does not Need to Become a Label

###### Accept the Diagnosis, Seek the Appropriate Treatment, and Reject the Label

###### But Don't Fight the Label as a way of Avoiding the Diagnosis

##### The Faulty Thinking is that if We Avoid the Diagnosis or the Label, My Child Doesn't Have a Problem

###### I Know a Family that Went to Four Different Physicians to Obtain a Diagnosis

###### The First Three Diagnosed Autism of Varying Degrees

###### They Kept Lobbying for a Diagnosis of Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome as They Considered that Preferable since It's on the less Severed End of the Spectrum

###### On the Fourth Diagnosis, the Got the Result "pervasive Development Disorder with Autism-like tendencies"

###### They Were Relieved that Their Child Was not Autistic

###### Their Denial Was Affirmed

###### They Spent All that Money and Effort to Support Their Denial

###### The Diagnosis Did not Change Their Child

###### The Fourth Doctor Probably Knew They Had the Previous Three Diagnosis and Decided to Tell Them what They Wanted to Hear to Stop Their Foolishness

###### Denying the Correct Diagnosis Prevents You from Seeking Proper Treatment or Assistance

#### Denial Lite: Minimizing the Implications of Reality

##### Exaggerating a childâ€™s Problems for Attention is Bad but Rare

##### More Commonly, People Will Attempt to Minimize the True Condition out of Fear or Shame

###### Have You Heard or Uttered Any of These?

###### My Child is Normal, but a Little Odd

###### My Child Needs a Little Help, but is not Special Needs

###### My Child's Condition is not as Bad as the Doctors Make it out to Be

###### My Child Will Grow out of it

###### Again, This is Counterproductive because the Parents Won't Seek Appropriate Help

##### Parents Minimize Their Child's Condition to Avoid Being Ostracized

###### Parents Have a Nasty Habit of Sequestering Their Children from Those Children Who Are More Severe

###### Typical Children Don't want Special Needs Children around

###### Parents of Special Needs Children want Their Children to Play with Typical Children

###### More Typical is Always Considered Better

###### Parents Pretend Their Child is less Severe than the Child Really is

### Denial of Responsibility

#### Parents Will Seek Others to Blame for the Condition Itself

##### It's Common in the Early Stages of Acceptance to Admit the Problem is Real, but to Deflect Any Responsibility to Others

##### The Doctors Created This Problem

###### My Child Was Poisoned by Vaccines

###### Something Happened during Childbirth

##### The School Created This Problem

###### The Teachers Are Bad

###### The Teachers Don't Understand My Child

##### The Spouse Created the Problem

###### All Attempts to Assign Responsibility Are Wrong because We Don't Know what Causes Autism

###### Some of the Sources of Personal Blame Are Downright Ridiculous

###### Bad Genes

###### Bad Diet or Habits

###### Bad Parents

###### Bad Karma

###### High Divorce Rate

###### Blaming Each other Forms Resentments and Contributes to High Divorce Rate

###### Parents Need to Agree on Diagnosis and Treatment

###### When One is in Denial, that Parent Becomes an Obstacle for Treatment

###### Primal Desire to Help is Thwarted

###### The Parent Pushing for Treatment Will Be Extremely Upset

##### My Wife and I Each Blamed Each other and Formed Resentments over it

###### I Have an Uncle Who is on the Spectrum

###### My Wife Concluded it Was My Bad Genetics that Were Responsible

###### She Said I Should Have Told Her about My Family History

###### I Guess She Wouldn't Have Married Me, Right?

###### One Data point Can Be Completely Convincing if there is no other place to Assign Blame

###### My Wife at Tuna during Her Pregnancy

###### Tuna is Known to Be High in Mercury

###### Heavy Metals, Particularly Mercury, Has Been Falsely Linked to Autism

###### I Told Her She Should Have Known Better than to Eat Tuna and She is Responsible

###### I Didn't Really Believe It, but it Seemed like a Good Retort at the time

###### When We Argued over This Issue, We Each Came up with even More Bizarre and Far-fetched Reasons why the other Was Responsible for My Son's Autism

###### Only the Futility of the Exercise Finally Prompted Us to Stop

###### What Positive End Result Does Assigning Blame Gain?

###### Let's Imagine that One of Us is Right, and the other Person is Responsible for Our Shared Problem

###### It's Still a Shared Problem that Doesn't Go away with Blame

###### We Are both Equally Responsible for Solving it

###### It's not like the Party Who is not Responsible is no Longer Going to Help with Care

###### What Are We Supposed to Do with Information on Who is Responsible for the Cause?

###### What Possible Useful Decision or Course of Action Can come out of Properly Assigning Blame?

###### Would Knowing it Was My Bad Genes or Her Bad Diet in Any way Suggest a Course of Treatment?

###### If either One of Us Actually Accepted This Blame, We Would Have Ended up Feeling Terrible about what We Supposedly Did

###### What Could Would come of That?

###### Should I Feel Bad for Having a Family Member on the Spectrum?

###### Should She Feel Bad for Eating Tuna?

###### Remorse is a Positive Benefit if it Prevents Bad Decisions in the Future, but Remorse Has no Benefit in This Situation

###### If You Think Rationally about the Possible Outcomes for Assigning Blame, You Won't Do it

###### First, You Could Never Be Sure You Were Correct in Assigning the Blame

###### There is no Known Cause for Autism, so Any Blame Would Be Based on Supposition, not Fact

###### People Are Often Quite Certain in Their Blame and Completely Mistaken

###### Would it Be Appropriate to Hold Someone Responsible for Something They Did not Cause?

###### Second, if Blame is Accepted, it Merely Causes Distress with no Positive Value

###### It's All Cloud and no Silver Lining

###### Third, if Blame is Rejected, it Causes Ongoing Tension between the Parents as Each One Blames the other and Sustains Anger over it Which Hardens into Resentment

###### Resentment against Your Spouse is a Cause of Divorce

###### For All These Reasons, My Wife and I Stopped Blaming Each other and Decided to Put that Energy into Making Our Son's Life Better instead

#### Parents Will Seek Others to Make Responsible for Curing Their Child

##### I Can't Solve It, so Others Must

##### Someone Else Will Cure My Child

##### My Child Can Be Cured by Doctors

##### My Child Can Be Cured by Social Services

##### My Child Can Be Fixed by the School System

###### I Was Guilty of Committing This Error

###### We Lived in a Great School System with Stellar Services

###### I Felt Good because I Knew He Was Getting the Best Education Possible

###### But I Used This to Sustain My Denial that He Would Be Cured and Completely Overcome His Autism

###### I Remember One of My Son's Early Education Meetings where I Asked that He Be Made to "catch up" to His Peers

###### The People in charge of His Education Were Gracious Enough to Remain Silent and Offer to Do what They Can

###### However, They Could See My Denial for what it Was

###### They Could Have Told Me at the time that He Was Never Going to "catch up" because it Was Obvious to Anyone Who Knew Him and Worked with Him that barring a Miracle, He Was Going to Be Who He is Today

###### I Didn't want to Hear the Truth

###### It Probably Would Have Made Me Angry if They Had Told Me

###### Because My Denial and Resistance to Reality Wouldn't Permit that to Be True

##### My Child Can Be Cured by My Faith or My Social Network

###### While It's Good to Have Support, It's Wrong to Believe This Support Will Fix Your Child

#### Blaming Others and Making Others Responsible for Curing Your Child is not Productive or Helpful in Any way

### The Problems with Denial

#### The Key to Overcoming Any Disturbing Emotion is to Focus on the Problems that Pattern of Thought and Feeling Creates

#### The Relentless Resistance of Reality

##### Despite My Determination and Effort, My Son Was not Cured

###### The Despair Remained, and I Got Used to the Feeling

###### Only Denial and the Desire to Find a Cure Pulled Me out

###### At the Time, I Wished I Had Some Better Techniques for Dealing with Despair

###### But I Thought the Best Alternative Was to Find a Solution to My Son's Autism

###### Unfortunately, I Didn't Know at the time that Seeking a Cure is Merely a Path to Denial

###### I Was Wrong, so the Despair Hung around for a while

##### My Irresistible Force of Determination Encountered the Immovable Object of Reality

###### You Can't Change what is through Force of Will

###### The Belief that You Can or Could is a Source of Tremendous Suffering

###### As the Borg from Star Trek Said "resistance is futile."

###### As the Buddha Noted "it is Your Resistance to what is that Causes Your suffering."

##### Evaluations and Test Scores

###### Part of the Reason I Became an Arrogant and Prideful Fool in My Youth is due to the Stellar Scores I Always Obtained on Standardized Tests

###### I Consistently Scored in the top Few Percentiles in Every Area on Every Standardized Test I Had Ever Taken

###### I Was Always Told I Was Super Smart and Destined for Great Things

###### The Result Was a Lot of False and Grandiose Beliefs about Myself that Ended up Hindering Me for Most of My Life

###### But since I Had Consistently Done well on Tests like This, I Assumed My Child Would Inherit My Brilliant Genes, and He Could Compete with Me Growing up to See if He Could Score Better

###### It Didn't Turn out that way

###### I Used to Dread the Education Meetings Were We Would Discuss His Results on Standardized Tests

###### My Son Scored Literally on the other End of the Testing Spectrum

###### I Guess it Makes Sense if I Scored in the 99th Percentile that Someone out there Had to Score in the 1st Percentile

###### I just Never Thought it Would Be My Son

###### In One of the Education Assessments We Obtained, They Reported My Son Had Scored in the 0.01 Percentile

###### He Literally Obtained the Worst Score out of 10,000 People

###### In Fact, it Was Probably Worse than that as They only Kept Decimal Precision to the Second Digit

###### That 0.01 Percentile Number Was Burned into My Brain

###### I Don't Remember the Rest of the Meeting, what Was Discussed or Decided

###### The Thought of 0.01 Was so Overpowering to Me, that I Wanted to Break down into Tears Right there

###### I Held it together through the Meeting, Putting My Emotions on a Shelf for Later Processing

###### The only Thing I Do Remember from the Meeting Was when We Signed the Acknowledgment Papers I Told Them that They Really Should Drop the Decimal Precision on Their Reporting.

###### No Parent Wants to Read that Their Child is in the Bottom 0.01 Percent.

###### To This Day, when I Think about that Score, it Makes Me Sad

##### Parents in Denial Are Extremely Unhappy

##### Denial of the Obvious Takes much Energy

##### Denial Requires a Constant Influx of Anger to Maintain

##### Curse God or Fate

##### Parents Often Retreat into Negative Behaviors

###### Alcoholism

###### Drub Abuse

###### Workaholism

###### Family Abandonment

##### The Grinding Destruction of Permanent Resistance

###### Our Culture is Full of Stories of Heroic Resistance Winning out in the End

###### Unfortunately, in the Real World, Permanent Resistance is a Soul-draining Path to a Hollow Defeat

###### Parents We Met in Irvine with Two Special Needs Children

###### Wife Became a Special Needs Teacher

###### Father Was Devoted to both His Children

###### I Greatly Admired both of These Parents for Their Unwavering Devotion

###### Unfortunately, I also Felt Very Sad for Them

###### By the time the Two Were Teenagers, the Parents Were Completely Defeated

###### You Could See in Their Eyes the Despair of 15+ Years of Sustained Effort with so Little to Show for it

###### At Least from Their Perspective because They Desperately Wanted a Cure

###### The Look of Defeat Was Palpable as the Exuded a Sad Resignation to Defeat

###### They Weren't Interested in Acceptance of Their Children's Condition

###### They Weren't Looking for how They Could Enjoy Their Children the way the Were

###### Sadly, as the Father Grew to Accept Their Fate, the Couple Grew apart

###### The Mother Simply Couldn't Accept that Her Children Would Remain Autistic

###### The Couple Ended up Divorcing

#### Denial Leads to Negative Outcomes for the Parents and the Child

##### The Child Doesn't Get Appropriate Help

###### Failure to Implement Proven Treatments for Symptoms

###### Failure to Utilize Appropriate Aid Resources

#### The sooner You Abandon Your Denial the Happier You Will Be and Your Child Will Experience Better Life Outcomes

## Sadness is the Great Liberator

### Sadness is a Necessary and Healthy Emotion Leading to Acceptance

#### Where Anger is a Pushing Away, Sadness is a Pulling toward

##### You Don't Accept what You Resist or Push away

#### You Will not Find Happiness until You've Digested and Processed the Sadness

#### Embracing Sadness is a Difficult but Essential part of Your Spiritual Journey

### Grief is the Processing of Sadness

#### Sadness Can't Be Avoided to Get to Acceptance

##### Sadness Must Be Endured to Reach Acceptance

##### Acceptance is the opposite of Resistance

#### Processing is the Equivalent of Emotional Digestion

##### Sadness is a Bitter Drink that Must Be Fully Digested

#### Grief is Processed by Feeling Sadness without Resistance

#### The Greater the Resistance the Slower the Processing

#### Surrendering to Sadness Speeds the Process

### Don't Avoid the Sadness that Leads to Acceptance

#### This is a Common Mistake

#### Unfortunately it Leads to Negative Outcomes

##### People Often Fail to Obtain the Appropriate Assistance

##### Abdicate Responsibility to Others

##### Perpetuates a State of Unhappiness

##### Ignoring or Suppressing Sadness Doesn't Eliminate it

### Sadness is not Depression but it Can Become a Depression

#### There is a Problem with Digesting Too much Sadness

##### Prolonged Feelings of Sadness Becomes Depression

#### Sadness Must Be Endured in Reasonable Doses

##### Too much Sadness Leads to Depression

##### Too Little Sadness Prolongs Recovery

##### Avoiding Sadness Prevents Reaching the Final Destination of Acceptance

#### Denial and Bargaining Relieve the Symptoms of Sadness

#### Respite from Sadness Can Be Found in Denial, Anger, and Bargaining

##### Moving between Surrender to Sadness and Denial and Bargaining is Essential to Avoid Depression

##### Denial is not Bad when Taken as Respite

##### Bargaining is not Bad when it Facilitates Right Action

##### Anger is Bad, but it Can Be Transformed into Determination to Take Action

#### Depression Shuts down Processing and Promotes "stuckness"

### Grief, Sadness, and Forrest Gump

#### If You Have a Special Needs Child, the Movie Forrest Gump Will Disturb You Emotionally in Wonderful Ways

#### The Movie Artfully and Poignantly Illustrates the Difficulties and Possibilities of a Life with Special Needs

#### There is a Scene after Jenny Leaves Forrest where He is Overcome with Grief and Starts to Run

##### He Runs across the Country and Keeps Running

##### He Runs for Years and Gains a Cult following

##### He Isn't Angry, He Isn't in Denial, and He is in touch with His Feelings

##### He Isn't Fully Aware of why He's Running, He just Feels Compelled to Run

##### He Has no Agenda, no Political Statement, no Desire to Influence Others

##### Viewers Have the Context of the Movie, and We Knew He Was Running from His Grief over the Loss of Jenny from His Life

###### He is Digesting Sadness

##### What Nobody Knows, even Forrest, is how much Grief He Has to Process and how long He Will Need to Keep Running

#### At Some Point, He's Run through His Sadness and He Simply Stops Running and Announces He Wants to Go home

##### Such is the way of Processing Grief

###### Nobody Knows how much Sadness They Have to Digest

###### Nobody Knows how long it Takes

###### When It's Over, Your Mind just Stops Thinking about It, and It's over

#### This Sequence in the Movie is a Great Analogy for Processing Grief

## Wanting Your Typical Child

### Quote

#### Jealousy - Queen

#### Oh how Strong Can You Be

#### With Matters of the Heart?

#### Life is much Too short

#### To while away with Tears

#### If only You Could See

#### Just what You Do to Me

#### Oh Jealousy You Tripped Me up

#### Jealousy You Brought Me down

#### You Bring Me Sorrow You Cause Me Pain

#### Jealousy when Will You Let Go?

#### Gotta Hold of My Possessive Mind

#### Turned Me into a Jealous Guy

### Jealousy and Your Special Needs Child

### I Was Jealous toward Parents with Typical Children

#### When I First Noticed My Son Was Different, I Felt Jealous toward the Parents with Children Who Were Developing Normally

#### They Had Something I Wanted, a Typical Child

#### The Jealousy Grows because Associated with that Typical Child Are All the Dreams, Hopes, and Aspirations for the Future

#### I Felt Shame that My Child Was so far Behind, Which Increased the Jealousy

#### If You Are Prone to Feel Jealousy, Special Needs Children provide Endless Opportunities to Indulge Yourself

### The Problems with Jealousy

#### Jealousy is Displeasure with Someone Else's Good Fortune

#### You Can Become Jealous of Another's Possessions, Good Qualities, Skills, Knowledge, Reputation, Fame or Popularity

##### Basically Anything Another Person Has that You want

#### There Are Plenty of Strong Reasons to Purge Jealousy from Your Heart and Mind

##### Jealousy is a Source of Anger, Discontent, and Mental Disturbance

##### Jealousy Leads to Obsession, a Persistent Mental Disturbance

##### Jealousy Can Lead to the Desire to Harm Others, the opposite of Compassion

##### Jealousy is a Futile Waste of time and Energy

###### Jealousy Does not Increase Your Good Qualities

###### Jealousy Does not Reduce the Good Qualities of Others

###### Jealousy only Succeeds in Disturbing Peace of Mind

### Jealousy Lowers the Quality of All Your Relationships

#### Jealousy Robs Us of the Opportunity to Feel Joy for other People, including Friends and Family

#### Jealousy Prevents Us from Exchanging Places with Others, Isolating Us and Fostering Selfishness

#### Jealousy is Corrosive to Our Relationships

##### You Can't Feel Good about Your Friends and Family's Good Fortune

##### You Tear down Good People in Your Mind

##### People Often Work to Harm Others and Remove Their Sources of Happiness

###### A Source of Non-virtuous Action

###### Often the Cause of Physical Violence

#### When You Succumb to Jealousy, You End up with Friends and Acquaintances that Are Unhappy and Generally Unpleasant, More Miserable, less Skilled, Poorer, in Every way less than You Are

##### This Happens because Jealousy Pushes away Anyone whose Qualities Made You Feel Jealousy

###### They Wouldn't want to Be around You Any More than You Would want to Be around Them

###### This Leaves You with the Worst of the Worst People as Friends

###### Your Every Interaction with Your Friendly Acquaintances Will Be Tearing down Others and Pointing out Their Perceived Weaknesses and Foibles

### Non-judgment Stops Jealousy from Arising

#### Jealousy is Rooted in Comparison and Expectation Born of Entitlement

##### I Was Jealous toward Parents of Typical Children because I Compared Their Circumstances to Mine

##### Further, I Felt Entitled to what They Had, so I Was Upset that I Did not Get what I Was Entitled to

##### The Combination of Comparison and Entitlement Generated Jealousy within Me

#### The Mental Discipline of Non-judgment Reduced the Cause of Jealousy

##### If You Don't Make the Comparison, the Judgment, Jealousy Doesn't Have the Spark that Ignites the Flame

##### Like other Spiritual Practices, it Requires Mental Discipline, and a Recognition of the Perils of Jealousy

##### The Problem with Non-judgment is that It's Most effective at Stopping Jealousy at Inception

###### It's also Difficult for Many to Practice since Judgments come so Quickly and Naturally

###### Once the Judgment is Made and Jealousy Arises, Non-judgement not the Most Useful Technique for Redirection or Stopping the Feelings from Growing Stronger

###### For That, Rejoicing is a More Powerful Practice

### Rejoicing Overcomes Jealousy

#### I Knew Jealousy Was not an Uplifting or Productive Emotion, so I Needed to Find a way to Stop Feeling It.

##### In Puberty and High School, I Felt Jealousy on Occasion, but I Was not Prone to Getting Caught up in It.

###### I Didn't Have Family History that Made Jealousy a Major Issue

###### Except Perhaps in Finances

###### I Didn't Seek out the Drama

###### Whenever I Found Myself Feeling Jealousy, I Usually just Removed Myself from the Circumstances that Caused it

###### Based on what I Saw Some of My Friends Go Through, I Always Thought that Instinct Served Me well

##### I Was not Prepared for the Causes of Jealousy I Faced with My Special Needs Child

###### I Didn't Have Advanced Strategies for Dealing with Jealousy

###### Avoidance Was no Longer a Realistic Option if I Wanted to Be Involved with My Family, Which I Did

#### I Came across a Buddhist Teaching on Rejoicing

##### This Isn't the Christian Concept of Worshiping

##### Buddhist Rejoicing is the Practice of Exchanging Yourself with Another and Feeling Sympathetic Joy through Them

###### It's as Simple as Putting Yourself in Their Shoes and Imagining Their Joy

##### The Key Aspect of the Practice is to Employ and Sustain the Focus on the Joyous Feeling whenever Jealousy Arises

###### The Undisciplined Mind Would Use the Sympathetic Joy as a Trigger for Feeling More Jealousy

###### A Disciplined Mind Crowds out the Feelings of Jealousy by Appreciating the Joy Experienced by Another

### I Practice Feeling Joy through the Parents of other Children

#### I Feared This Would Increase My Jealousy, but the opposite Was Actually the case

#### I Would Imagine Myself in Their place and Felt the Joy They Felt in Their Children's Development and Accomplishments

##### I Focused My Mind of Being Happy for Them

###### And through Them, I Found a Measure of Happiness for Myself

##### I Didn't Compare Their Child to Mine

###### That Would Have Lead to Jealousy and Despair

###### I Had to Learn to Cut off Those Thoughts of Comparison the Moment They Would Arise

###### I Learned This out of Necessity

###### I Later Found This Form of Mental Discipline Was a Spiritual Practice Called Applying Opponents in Buddhism

###### Comparisons Were a Train of Thought Leading to a Destination Full of Suffering

###### It Was a Mental Discipline not to Board that Train

###### And it Was a Discipline because My Mind Habitually Wanted to Board that Train to Nowhere Good

##### I just Felt Some Degree of the Joy They Felt, and I Was Happy for Them

###### Their Good Fortune Didn't Diminish Me or My Child

###### This Isn't a Zero-sum Game

##### In Sharing Their Joy, and in not Comparing My Child to Theirs, My Jealousy Diminished

#### I Found that More I Honored the Good Fortune and Good Qualities of Others, the More I Was Elevated

##### The Mind Thinks the opposite is True

##### The Mind Seeks to Elevation the Self by Bringing Others down

##### Rejoicing Elevates the Self by Reveling in Another's Goodness or Good Fortune

##### Rejoicing is a Practice of a Pure Mind Unhindered by Selfish Concerns

##### It Isn't Easy, and it Isn't what the Mind Naturally Wants to Do

### I Practiced Offering Honor and respect for Their Child's Achievements

#### When I Would See Another's Child Doing Something Extraordinary, I Would Complement Them

##### Ordinarily, This Was a Trigger for Jealousy

##### I Took it as a Reminder to Feel Sympathetic Joy for Their Good Fortune

##### This Practice Prevented the Jealousy from Arising and Replaced it with a Warm Feeling of Joy

#### When I Would See a Family Enjoying a Good time with Their Child, I Would Express Pleasure in that

##### This Was also a Trigger for Jealousy that I Learned to Turn into Its opposite

#### After Starting to Practice Rejoicing, I Found it Attracts Better Friends

##### People Naturally want to Be around Others Who Celebrate Their Accomplishments

##### People Who Rejoice with Others Are Truly Supportive Friends that Wish only the Best for Them

##### When You Rejoice with Others, They Take Pleasure in Your Company

### Rejoicing Diminishes Feelings of lack

#### I Didn't Set out to Overcome lack

##### I Didn't even Recognize it Was a Problem

##### Lack Was a Consistent Feature of My Life that Brought Me down

###### But I Assumed that Was just how Life Was

###### It Seemed Everyone Was Experiencing it

###### It Wasn't until Later that I Connected This Feeling to the Suffering Described by the Buddha

#### When I Was Focused on Someone Else's Enjoyments, I Was not Thinking about My Own Feelings of lack and Insufficiency

#### I Realized that Rejoicing Comes from a Mind of Abundance

##### A Belief that I Will not Experience lack

#### As My Sense of lack Diminished, the Root Cause of Jealousy Was Weakened

##### And My Life Felt More Complete and Fulfilled

## The Tough Get Going

### Quote

#### When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going

# Billy Ocean

## I Got Something to Tell You

## I Got Something to Say

## I'm Gonna Put This Dream in Motion

## I Never Let Nothing Stand in My way

## When the Going Gets touch

## The Tough Get Going

## I'm Gonna Get Myself 'cross the River

## That's the Price Iâ€™m Willing to Pay

## Searching for a Cure to Solve the Problem

## Acknowledging that the Condition Exists Begins the Journey to Acceptance

### The Journey to Acceptance Has Many Attractive Diversions

### Exploring and Indulging These Diversions Are part of the Process

### Like Most People, I Wasn't Willing to Accept what I Judged as Bad until I Explored Every other Alternative First

#### Of Course, I Didn't Consider Exploring the Idea that Perhaps what I Thought Was Bad Really Wasn't

#### Perhaps This Book Will Convince You to Explore that Idea and save You Years of Lost time and Money in Diversions that Won't Lead You to what You Desire

## At First, I Accepted My Son Was Autistic but Rejected that it Was Permanent

### Most Common Form of Denial

### The First Rest Stop of Bargaining on the Swim across the Ocean of Sadness

### For Some Families This Turns out to Be True

#### Which just Reinforces the Denial among the Vast Majority for Whom It's not True

### Most Natural and Longest Lasting Stage of Grief

#### Like Many Others I Envision This as the End Game

##### I Saw Myself as a Hero and a Savior

##### "I Will Never Give up Fighting for My child"

##### "I Will search as long as it Takes to Find a cure"

#### I Believed that if I just Persisted long Enough, Fought Hard Enough, My Child Would Be Cured

#### Many Support Groups Exist Merely to Sustain This Form of Denial

#### Unfortunately, Resistance Does not Change Reality

#### Resistance Merely Prolongs Suffering

#### I even Took My Suffering as Badge of Courage, Proving My Resolve and Perseverance

##### This Fed My Delusions of Nobility and Strength

##### In Reality, I Was an Ignorant Fool Who Believed His Own Arrogant Narrative

##### None of This Benefitted My Son

## I Sought Solace and Hope in Stories of Recovery

### Most Autism Books Are of This Variety

#### I Read Many of Them

### You May Have Picked up This Book Expecting the Same Thing

### These Stories Feel Good, but They Sustain an Unproductive and Unhealthy Denial

### Why not Books that Celebrate Their Special Child's Uniqueness?

#### These Are Exceedingly Rare

#### If These Books Were More Common, I wouldnâ€™t Have Felt the Need to Write This One

### Pitfalls to Immersion in Recovery Stories

#### There is no Cure

#### Reinforcing Denial

#### Sentencing Yourself to Sustained Misery

#### Become an Overzealous Advocate

##### Fight like Hell

##### Cure or Bust

## Finding Support with other Parents

### Support Groups Are Helpful

### Support Groups Can Be a Source of Good Information

### It's Comforting to Share Experiences with People Who Have Gone through Similar Trials

### Since Most People Are in Denial in One Form or Another, Most of the Support in These Groups is Geared toward Sustaining Denial

### Personally, My Wife and I Did not Spend much time with Support Groups

#### Being Introverts, We Didn't Need the Social contact

#### And Being Realistic, I Grew Weary of the Denial and the Need to Stay Silent to Avoid Angering People

## Setting out to Find a Cure

### Like Most People, when I Acknowledged that I Had a Problem, I Tried to Solve It.

#### Everyone Goes through This

#### This is where the Energy of Angry Determination Gets Directed

#### Most People Do what I Did and Research Everything Written

#### To the Degree that Your Actions Help Your Child, They Are Good.

#### To the Degree that it Supports Your Denial, It's Counterproductive

#### It's Important to Parse the Difference

### I Wasn't just Interested in Treatment, I Wanted to Find a Cure

#### I Wasn't Interested in Being Realistic with My Expectations

#### I Chased Unicorns, and I Felt Seduced by Worthless Snake Oil Treatments

##### I Was Fortunate I Didn't Allow My Wishful Thinking to Waste Too much Money on Worthless Treatments

## Fixing My Broken Child

### I Felt that My Child Was Broken, that Something is Wrong, Terribly Wrong

### I Asked that He Be Made to "catch up" to His Peers

### I Was Disheartened by the 0.01 Percentile Score

### This is not what I Wanted

### Most People Believe the Journey to Acceptance Ends here in a Depressing Dead End

#### Not Realizing there Was a Silver Lining

## Determination Forged from Denial

### At This Stage in My Life, I Believed that Anger Served a Useful Purpose

#### The Fire of Anger Could Drive a Powerful Engine of Determination

#### It's a Compelling Narrative, and it Carries a Kernel of Truth

#### However, Iâ€™ve Learned through Experience that Sustained Anger is Very Harmful, and Any Benefit Obtained from Keeping it Alive is not Worth the Price Paid

#### Determination Sustained by Anger is Denial, and while it May Be Temporarily Comforting, It's Emotionally Disturbing and Draining over Time, and it Was Harmful to My Health

#### I Used My Anger and Channeled it into a Determination to Find the Best Possible Treatment for My Son, a Cure if it Existed

##### I Felt Noble.

##### I Was Perceval on the quest for the Holy Grail, the Cup Jesus Drank from at the Last Supper, an Artifact with Healing Powers

##### Unfortunately, Perceval Was a Fool, and so Was I

### I Had Formed Some Hidden Beliefs that Served to Sustain My Anger and Hinder My Spiritual Growth for Many Years

#### First, I Believed My Child Was Broken and Needed to Be Fixed

##### This Implied He Was not Acceptable just as He Was and Who He Was

##### He Needed to Change

#### Second, I Believed I Had the Power, the Intellect, the Drive to Find a Treatment that Would Make Him Better

##### This Was a Complete Delusion Based on Ego, Pride, and Wishful Thinking

##### And I Knew it Was Foolish because I Knew there is no Cure, but I Searched Anyway

##### I Was Hunting Unicorns or Searching for the Holy Grail, Pick Your Metaphor

#### Third, This Was not what I Wanted, and I Would Never Be Happy as long as My Son Was Autistic

##### This Was Perhaps the Most Debilitating Delusion of Them All

##### It Was Implicit in My Dreams of a Perfect Family Life that I Deserved that Life, and only that Life Would Be Acceptable

###### It Was a Deep Sense of Entitlement, the opposite of Thankfulness and the Destroyer of Gratitude

##### It Prevented Me from Appreciating My Son's Unique Personality, Sense of Humor, Deep Love and Appreciation for Me, or Any of the Good He Brought to My Life

#### These Beliefs and other Similar and Related False Ideas Became the Bars on the Cage I Built in My Mind

##### It's a Cage I Struggled to Escape for the Better part of 15 Years

## The Perils of Doing Your Own Research

### People Are Generally Poor Researchers

#### Research is Usually Finding Trusted Resources and Accepting Them Uncritically

##### This is Particularly Enticing when the Resource Says what They want to Hear

#### People Accept Nonsense that They want to Believe as Truth

#### They Often Do not Understand the Science and Prefer Anecdotes

##### Bogged down in Medical Jargon

### Understanding Scientific Efficacy

#### Most People Become Concerned Their Child May Be Autistic when They Are Developmentally Delayed

#### Once the Delay is Documented, there Are Three Possible Outcomes

##### The Child Improves and Catches up to Peers

##### The Child Remains Delayed and Has Lifelong Limitations

##### The Child May Improve in Some Areas or for Some Time, but Eventually Development Stops Progressing or Gets Worse

#### Each Potential Outcome Has a Certain Percentage of Children Associated

#### A Treatment is only Considered effective if More Children Show Better Outcomes than no Treatment at All

#### So far Almost no Treatment for Autism Has Shown Any Efficacy at All

### The Problem with Correlation and Causation

#### Some Children Spontaneously Improve

#### Some Children Spontaneously Get Worse

#### The Cause of This Change is Completely Unknown

#### However, if the Change Corresponds to Some Specific Treatment, People Assume the Treatment Was the Cause, for Better or Worse

##### For Example, Vaccines

###### Many Autistic Children Suddenly Deteriorate at 18-24 Months

###### This Deterioration Roughly Corresponds to when Vaccines Are Administered

###### The Vaccine Gets Blamed as the Cause

###### No Statistical Connection with Vaccines Has Ever Been Established

###### Many Autistic Children Deteriorated at the Same Age whether or not They Had Vaccines

###### People Used to Blame the Mercury in Vaccines

###### However, after the Mercury Was Removed from Vaccines, Rates of Autism Did not Change

###### Mercury Was Eliminated from Vaccines in 2004, yet People Still Consider This a Cause

##### For Example, Most Snake Oil Treatments

###### Some Children Suddenly Start Improving

###### Parents Who Were Attempting Some Snake Oil Treatment at the time Assume the Treatment Was Responsible

###### The Anecdotes of the Response to Treatment Spreads on Social Media

###### People Mistake the Anecdotes for Real Statistical Evidence

###### The Snake Oil Treatment Was not the Cause of the Improvement, but People Believe it Was

###### People Waste Money on the Snake Oil Treatment and Endure the Disappointment

## Snake Oil, the High Cost of Bargaining

### When a Condition or Disease Has no Known Cure, Snake Oil Treatments Abound

### Snake Oil Exploits a Fear that a Viable Treatment Might Be Overlooked

#### No Parent Wants to Live with the Guilt of not Trying

#### The Lorenzoâ€™s Oil Syndrome

#### Parents Will Try Anything and Everything no Matter the Cost

#### This is how Snake Oil Peddlers Rip off Good Families

#### "every Child is unique" Doesn't Mean there is a Cure for Your Child

##### The Rates at Which Children Improve with Snake Oil Treatments is the Same as no Treatment at All

### Some Snake Oil Cures Are Dangerous and Should Be Avoided

#### Certain Diet Interventions

##### Mineral Cleation

###### When My Son Was Very Young, much of the Hope for Improvement Was with Diet and Nutrition

###### Mineral Cleation, or the Removal of Heavy Elements from the Tissues, Was Touted as Cure for Autism

###### This Was a Compelling Narrative since Lead Poisoning Shows Many of the Symptoms of Autism

###### This Belief also Contributed to the False Hysteria over Mercury in Vaccines

###### In Practice, Many Autistic Children Got Sick from Cleation Therapies

###### The First Rule of Treatment is to Do no Harm, and This Therapy Fails that Test

##### Bleach Ingestion

###### In the Late Twenty-teens, a Delusional Minister Started Promoting the Idea that Ingesting Bleach Had Positive Effect on Autism

###### It Wasn't Widely Practiced, but after a Few Children Got Sick, Some Parents Were Arrested and the Practice Largely Stopped

#### Demon Exorcism

##### This Was a Particular Problem in Fundamentalist Religious Communities

##### They Started with the Belief that Autism Was Caused by Demons and if These Demons Could Be Cast Out, the Autism Would Go away

##### No Child Who Underwent This Procedure Ever Showed Any Sign of Improvement.

##### A Few Children Were Killed through Excessive Blunt Force Trauma Intended to Exercise the Demons, and Authorities Finally Cracked down on the Practice

#### As long as the there Are Desperate Parents, there Will Be Snake Oil Treatments

##### As long as there Are Snake Oil Treatments, Some of Those Will Prove Harmful

##### You Don't want to Be the Parent that Hurts Their Helpless Child with an Unproven Treatment

### Comfort versus Cure

#### Many of the Snake Oil Treatments provide Comfort

#### The Advice is not to Avoid Enjoyable Treatments and Therapies

#### Manage Your Expectations

##### For Many Conditions, there is no Cure

##### You Will not Find a Cure on Your Own

#### Comfortable Treatments

##### Equestrian Therapy

###### I Lived near a Prominent Equestrian Therapy Center for Several Years, and My Son Went on a Few Occasions

###### It Was a Pleasant Experience for Him

###### It Did Nothing to Cure His Autism

##### Swimming with Dolphins

###### We Took a Trip to Hawaii and Stayed at a Resort where My Son Was Able to Experience Dolphins up close

###### They Swam with Him, and He Touched Them and Fed Them Fish

###### He Had a Great time

###### It Did Nothing to Cure His Autism

##### Massage Therapy

###### I've Had Professional Masseurs come to Our House and Give My Son a Massage

###### He Enjoyed the Experience

###### It Did Nothing for His Autism

##### Music Therapy

###### My Son Loves Music

###### I Listen to Music with Him Several times per Week, whenever We Drive Somewhere

###### It Doesn't Change His Condition

## Snake Oil

### Quote

#### Snake Oil - Steve Earle

#### People Never Fear

#### If You Ain't Impressed Yet, just Tell Me what You Wanna Hear

#### Well You Lost Your Farm so You Moved to Town

#### You Get a Job, They Shut the Factory down

#### Now You Sit around All Day long Feelin' Sad and Blue

#### You Need Snake Oil Y'all, Tell You what Iâ€™m Gonna Do

### Treatments and Snake Oil

### The Wide Variety of Potential Treatments for Autism

#### When I Set out to Find Possible Treatments, I Encountered All Sorts of Treatments from the Somewhat Helpful, through the Plausibly Effective, to the Completely Looney

#### What These All Had in Common Was that with the exception of Aba, They All Had Zero Proven Track Record of Effectiveness of Any Kind

#### The Internet if Full of Misinformation, much of it Plausible, Replete with Snake Oil Products to Take Your Money

#### The Ones that Sounded Most Convincing and Certain of Their Efficacy Often Turned out to Be the Least Effective, and in the case of Mineral Chelation Therapy, Demonstrably Dangerous

#### Delving into This Issue Gave Me a Deep Appreciation for how Badly People Fair when Doing Their Own Research

##### Most People Will Believe Anything if They want to Believe it Badly Enough

###### It Seems like They Believe Truth Can Be Generated by Desire Alone

###### This is True in Religion, Politics, and in Experimental Medical Treatments

##### Most People Will Accept Nonsense as Fact if it Confirms a Pre-existing Belief that They want to Cling to

##### Very Few Understand the Methods Science and what Separates a Valid Study from Misinformation or Invalid Anecdotes

##### Most Snake Oil Pitches Tout Their Scientific Validity while Offering no Studies or Evidence of Any Kind other than Bogus Anecdotes

##### People Are Easily Convinced by Unsubstantiated Anecdotes from People They Don't Know that Are Often Completely Fraudulent

##### I Was Shocked by how People Unskeptically Accept Self-serving Advice Offered by Those Trying to Sell Them Something

##### People Who Are Desperate for a Cure Will Try Anything and Pay Anything if They Believe there is even the Smallest Chance for Improvement

###### This is the Root of All Snake Oil Rip Offs

###### The Need for a Cure Provides the Pre-existing Bias that Makes Them want to Believe Nonsense because Sometimes, a Nonsensical Hope is All They Have

#### The Most Difficult Problem with Resisting Snake Oil is the Nagging Fear and Guilt that You Might Miss an Actual Cure

##### I Worried that if I Didn't Try Every Treatment out There, I Might Miss the One Treatment that Made All the Difference

##### We Have a Friend that Purchased Her Own Hyperbolic Oxygen Chamber, Spending Tens of Thousands of Dollars on Snake Oil

##### People Are only Willing to Spend that Kind of Money for Fear of Missing out and the Fear of Regret over not Having Tried

##### That is why Snake Oil Con Artists Fleece Innocent Families out of Huge Sums Every Day

### The Lure of Medications

#### There is no Medical Treatment effective to Counteract the Mental Disability of Autism

#### Our Culture is Biased toward Pharmaceutical Solutions to Almost Any Health Problem

##### People Believe that if They Have an Ailment, All They Need to Do is Take a Medication and the Ailment Can Be Eliminated or Controlled

##### There is a Widespread Belief that Medicines Can Cure Almost Anything, including Conditions like Autism, Which Actually Can't Be Cured with Medicine

##### Given This Bias toward Pharmaceutical Solutions, it Shouldn't Be Surprising to Find that Nearly Every Special Needs Child is on Some Combination of Medications

#### Experimenting with Different Medications until You Find the "right" One is a Fools Errand with Autism

##### I Know a Family with a Schizophrenic Son.

##### The Father Told Me the Key to Living with Schizophrenia is to Find the Right Medication

##### Not Being an Expert, and not Facing that Condition, I Take His Word for it

##### Pharmaceutical Interventions Have Their place

##### However, Their place is not in Treating Autism

##### I Know a Family that Has Taken Their Child to the Doctor Hundreds of times over the Years

###### They Will Go with Complaints about Some Ailment until They Find a Doctor Who Identifies Something and Offers Them a Prescription

###### Then They Feel Relieved that They Found the "right" Treatment, and Add This Drug to the List of Drugs Their Child is Already on

###### They Go through This Same Process with Finding the Right Drugs for the Side Effects Too

###### Taking More than Five Drugs at a time is Called Polypharmacy, and It's Considered Dangerous

###### At Any given Time, This Child May Be on a Dozen or More Medications

###### They Are All Considered Necessary and Backed up by Many Doctor's Appointments and Tests

###### The Parents Consider All These Medically Necessary

###### And the List only Grows Longer

###### If Any Conditions Stops Being Present, They Attribute that to the Drugs, and They Feel the Need to Sustain the Drugs to Prevent Recurrence

#### Some Autistic Behaviors Require Medical Intervention

##### The Treatment is not for Autism but for a Behavioral Problem Related to Autism

##### I Know One Family whose Autistic Son is Extremely Compulsive and an Eloper (likes to Run away).

##### Without Medications, This Young Man is a Danger to Himself and Others

##### In Those Circumstances, Medications that Help with Impulse Control Are Necessary and Appropriate

##### Some Children Have High risk of Seizure, Which is Another Circumstance where Medication May Be Necessary

##### Where the Health risk Necessitates a Medication, Parents Will Do What's Right for Their Child

###### However, Determining What's Medically Necessary versus What's Medically Convenient is Open to Different Interpretations

#### Most Autistic Children Do not Need Medications of Any Kind

##### Some Parents like the Simplicity of Drugging Their Child into a Stupor

##### When the Child is High or Drugged Out, Their Behavior is More Easily Manageable, or They Require no Management at All

##### This is Merely a Convenience for the Parents and Does Nothing for the Child

##### This is not a Justifiable Circumstance for providing Drugs to Children on an Ongoing Basis

##### My Son Has Never Been on a Medication other than Antibiotics or other Prescriptions for Temporary Conditions

###### We Have Been Fortunate that He Doesn't Have Any Condition that Would Require Medication

###### He Will Probably Never Be on a Regularly Prescribed Medication

###### We Have even Written These Instructions into His Trust

#### Drugs Have Side Effects

##### The Families that Iâ€™ve Known Who place Their Children on Drugs Are Usually on Some Kind of Drug Cocktail with Numerous Pills.

##### One Pill is for the Primary Condition, and the other Pills Are for the Side Effects of the Pill Supposed to Correct the Primary Condition

##### This is the Typical Path to Polypharmacy and Lifelong Drug Use

#### A close Friend of Mine from High School is a Pharmacist, and so is His Wife (they Met in school)

##### They Don't Take Any Drugs other than the Occasional Ibuprofen

##### None of the Pharmacists I Know Take Any Drugs

##### The Reason Most Offer is that They Believe Most Medications Are Too Powerful and They Would rather Their Body Regulate Itself, Which it Will if not Constantly Dosed with Some Medication

### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

#### My Research on This Treatment is how I Came to Fully Understand Snake Oil

#### A Friend of My Wife Worked for a Prominent Doctor Who Specialized in This Treatment

##### The First time We Went to His Office, We Bumped into a Famous Retired Astronaut Who Was Seeking Treatment for Depression

##### We Felt This Doctor (not a physician) Had Credibility due to His Years of Research in the Field

##### We Were Offered a Free Treatment since My Wife's Friend Worked with This Doctor

##### He Ran His Tests and Showed Us These Impressive Images of Activity in My Son's Brain

##### He Interpreted These Images and Gave Us the Impression This Treatment Would Work for Our Son

##### He Asked Us to Get up with Our Son and Spend 30 Minutes Each Morning Looking at the Rising Son before Our next Test a Week Later

###### Since This Was also a New Treatment of Sorts, there Would Be no way of Knowing if Any Perceived Improvement Was Caused by the Magnets or by Additional Attention and Morning Sunshine

#### We Went back for a Second Test

##### He Showed Us Brain Images Again, Touting the Differences

##### And He Asked Us if My Son Had Improved since the First Treatment

##### I Told Him that My Son Seemed a Bit Happier and Calmer, and He Said that Was a Good Sign

##### We Were Escorted into Another Room where We Were given the Sales Pitch Options for Ongoing Treatment

#### At that Pitch, I Felt All the Emotional Tugs that Motivates Snake Oil Sales

##### Perhaps This Treatment Would Work

##### My Son Seemed Different

##### I Wouldn't want to Pass on what Might Be a Good Treatment

#### When I Got Home, I Contemplated how the Sales Pitch Worked, and I Did Some Additional Research

##### What Struck Me as Odd at First Was how the Sales Pitch Resembled a Time-share or Used Car Pitch

###### We Were Shown the Product by a Supposed Expert

###### We Were Escorted to a Different Room to Discuss the Details

###### There Was an Expectation that We Would Sign up Right there

##### When I Thought about the Doctor's Interpretation of My Son's Brain Scans, it Occurred to Me that the Images Could Mean Anything, or Nothing at All.

###### I Was not Offered the Scans to Take for a Second Opinion

###### I Was Completely Relying on This Doctor's Expertise and Interpretations of Colors on a Computer Screen

###### He Could Have Told Me Anything, and I Wouldn't Have Known Any Differently

##### As I Researched Further, I Found that there Were Others Offering This Service, and Most of the Websites Made Fantastical Claims

###### Some Touted This Exclusive Treatment on the Cutting Edge of Scientific Inquiry

###### A Big Red Flag of Nonsense Completely Contrary to how Science Actually Works

###### I Read Some Criticisms of This Treatment by other Scientists Who Affirmed that It's Harmless Snake Oil

#### In the End, I Decided to Forgo the Treatment that Would Have Cost More than My Car

##### Not because it Was Expensive, but because it Was Snake Oil

### Brainwave Entrainment in His Crib, My Snake Oil

#### Before I Was Married, I Put a Lot of time and Effort into Studying Meditation, Sleep, Dream Interpretation, and Brainwave Entrainment

#### I even Developed Custom Brainwave Entrainment Mixes with Different Frequencies Matching Different Brainwave Patterns Based on a Typical 2-hour Sleep Cycle

#### I Would Record My Dreams by Keeping a Tape Recorder by My Bed, and I Would Spend time Analyzing Them

#### It Was Fun and Interesting, it Stimulated Lots of Memorable Dreams, and it Did Improve My Sleep, but it Didn't Lead to Enlightenment or Liberation or Any Significant Spiritual Growth or Emotional Changes, so I Lost Interest over time

#### However, I Did Remember how it Worked, and I Know it Was effective at Changing Moods and Stimulating Brain Activity, and it Was Totally Harmless

#### I Reasoned that if Autism Was Caused by Scrambled and Uncoordinated Brain Activity that Perhaps Synchronizing Them with Brainwave Entrainment Might Lead to Some Kind of Breakthrough

##### It's the Kind of Plausible Sounding Bullshit that Permeates Sites Peddling Snake Oil Cures for Autism

##### But since it Was Harmless, I Thought I Would Give it a Try

#### I Set up My Son's Crib with Speakers on Each Side to Create the Stereo Speaker Environment Needed to Create the Brainwave Entrainment Effect without Headphones

#### When He Would Nap, I Would Play My Old Brainwave Entrainment Mixes or just Play Alpha Wave Entrainment Music

#### My Son Responded the Same way I Did

##### He Slept Better on Occasion, and He Awoke More Rested

##### But You Could See there Were times when He Didn't want to Experience that Brainwave State, He Resisted It, and He Was less Restive

##### It Did Nothing to Rewire His Brain or Alleviate the Symptoms of His Autism

#### Everyone Holds out Hope that Their Hair-brain Idea Will Be the next Lorenzoâ€™s Oil.

##### It Was Worth a Try

##### I Knew it Would Do no Harm

##### Like All Snake Oil Treatments, it Did not Work

### Music Therapy

#### We Dabbled in Music Therapy

#### Mostly We Ended up Listing to a Lot of Classical Music

#### He also Obsessed on Coldplay for a Couple of Years

#### He Still Enjoys Music, and He is Still Autistic

### Eating Therapy

#### Autistic Children Often Develop Strong Aversions for Loud Noises, Certain Textures, or Any of a Variety of Sensations

#### Its Quite Common for Them to Develop Aversions to Certain Foods, Which Can Lead to Extreme Limitations on Diet

#### My Son Self Limited Food to Kfc Chicken Nuggets and Cantaloupe

##### He Literally only Ate Those Two Foods, and He Would Go without Eating rather than Eat Something Else

#### While We Were considering Our Options, One of the Students in My Son's Class Had a Feeding Tube that Protruded from His Skin near His Stomach

##### The Tube Had a Cap that Could Be Opened so that Liquid Nourishment Could Be Injected through the Tube Directly into His Stomach

##### We Observed with This Child how far Autistic Children Would Go in Their Self-limiting Behavior

##### The Idea that if They Get Hungry Enough, They Will Eat, Simply Isn't Correct

##### When My Son Was down to only Two Foods, We Felt We Needed to Act

#### We Sent Him to a Feeding Specialist

##### It Sounds Doctorly and Medical, but it Wasn't

##### She Was just a Therapist Who Was Willing to Force Autistic Children to Eat

##### She Would Make Them Keep Food in Their Mouths and not Spit it out as long as it Took for Them to Eat it

##### She Was Undeterred by Tears, Tantrums, or Vomit

##### When Weighed against the Possibility of a Lifelong Feeding Tube, We Opted for This Torturous Treatment

##### She Was Successful in Getting My Son past His Aversions to other Foods

#### I Still Have Mixed Feelings about Our Decision

##### The Fear of the Lifelong Feeding Tube Was Real

###### We Knew Personally a Child with a Feeding Tube that Was Going on Five Years

###### Knowing This Was a Choice My Autistic Child Was Making and not a Medical Necessity, We Decided We Were not Going to Give Him the Freedom to Make that Choice

##### However, We Were not at Our Last Resort

###### He Was not Starving

###### He Was Still Eating Two Foods

###### He Might Have Gotten Better on His Own

###### The Treatment We Put Him through Was Considered the Last Resort before a Feeding Tube

###### I Don't Know if We Were there

##### The Treatment Was Traumatic

###### Imagine Being Forced to Eat a Food You Don't like

###### You Can't Spit it out

###### And no Matter how Unpleasant You Find It, You Have to Eat it

###### I Wouldn't want to Go through that

###### But then Again, I Wouldn't want a Feeding Tube either

##### I Am not Certain We Did the Right Thing

###### He Eats a Wide Variety of Food now

###### If Anything, He Has the More Common Problem of Weight Control

###### He no Longer Has Issues with Eating, other than Perhaps He Likes it Too much

###### Does that End Justify the Means?

###### If You Are Faced with that Choice, You Will Need to Answer it for Yourself and Your Child

###### There Isn't a Clear Choice That's 100% Correct

### Aba Therapy

#### Applied Behavior Analysis

##### A Type of Therapy that Focuses on Improving Specific Behaviors, such as Social Skills, Communication, Reading, and Academics as well as Adaptive Learning Skills, such as Fine Motor Dexterity, Hygiene, Grooming, Domestic Capabilities, Punctuality, and Job Competence.

#### When We Learned My Son Was Autistic, the only Treatment with Any Scientific Validity Was Aba Therapy

##### It Was Prominently Featured in the Book "let Me Hear Your voice"

###### This is Often One of the First Books Parents Find on the Subject

###### It Provides Hope, Sometimes False Hope, to Many Parents, and the Book Remains Popular Today

###### Contributes to the False Idea that Autism means Broken, Which is why I Don't Recommend it to People

###### It's Helpful for Those Who Are Struggling with Despair

###### It's Useful for Those Who Need Denial

#### Aba Was Useful for My Son

##### He Acquired Some Useful Life Skills

##### He Benefited from the close Attention from Caring People

##### It Didn't Really Do Anything to Cure His Autism

##### Aba is a Coping Strategy, not a Treatment

##### It's not a Great Treatment, but It's Better than All Others Available

#### Aba Has Limitations

##### Rote Learning

##### Unable to Generalize

##### Akin to Pet Training

##### Children Don't Know why They Are Doing it

#### Aba Will Likely Be a Big part of Any Service Program Offered by Schools or the State

#### For More Information, Buy a Current Book on the Subject

## A Broken Hallelujah

### Quote

#### Hallelujah

# Song by Leonard Cohen

## Well People Iâ€™ve Been here before

## I Know This Room and Iâ€™ve Walked This Floor

## You See I Used to Live Alone before I Knew Ya

## And Iâ€™ve Seen Your Flag on the Marble Arch

## But Listen Love, Love is not Some Kind of Victory March, no

## It's a Cold and It's a Broken Hallelujah

## The Social Challenges of a Special Needs Child

## My Wife and I Are both Introverts

### So We Don't Have a Large Group of Friends or a Vibrant Social Life

### We Spend Most of Our time with Family and a Few close Friends

### It Works for Us

## When My Son Started School, He Was Segregated into Classes with other Children with Special Needs

### This Ended up Making Our Social contact through School with other Parents with Special Needs Children

#### Which is how I Met and Got to Know a Number of Similar Families

#### My Wife Often Lamented that Our Circle of Friends Was so Limited because We Couldn't Join in with the much Larger Community of Parents with Typical Children

#### We Weren't Going to Meet Parents outside of His Classroom Acquaintances because We Wouldn't Be Going to Parties or Participating in Sporting Events

##### We Did Meet Many other Great Families at a Special Needs Baseball League, and I Am Thankful that We Lived in a Large Enough Metropolitan Area where These Programs Could Flourish

## One of the First Thing that Stands out when You Are a Parent of a Special Needs Child is that other Parents with Typical Children want Nothing to Do with You

### I Understand that Special Needs Children Have Difficulty with Socialization, and Parents of Typical Children Don't Know how to Deal with the Differences, but it Was Still a Difficult Thing to Accept

#### All the Parents I Thought I Would Make Friends With, I Didn't

### What's even Sadder is that even the Victims of This Discrimination Are also Perpetrators of It.

#### Parents of less Severe Children Don't want the More Severe Children around

##### They Fear Their Children Will Learn Bad Habits

##### And They want Their Children to Be with Typical Children where They Will Learn Proper Socialization

#### The Parents with the Most Severe Children End up Being the Most Socially Isolated

#### That Makes Me Sad.

#### I Feel Compassion for Their Plight, but there Isn't much I Can Do about it

## There is a Debate in the Special Needs and Education Communities about Inclusion in Regular Classes

### One of the Big Reasons for This Push is so that Special Needs Children Can Obtain the Proper Socialization

### The Problem is that it Usually Doesn't Work

### A Friend of Ours Sued the School System to provide an Inclusive Class Experience for Her Son

#### The School System Complied and provided Him with a Devoted Aide and Full Inclusion in a Regular Classroom

##### If Your Family Has the Resources to Lawyer up and Fight the Schools, You Can Win Some Pyric Victories

##### It's Expensive, but in Some Districts, It's Probably a Necessary Evil

#### The Experience for This Child Turned out to Be a Debacle

##### The Special Needs Student Needed More Attention than the Devoted Aide Would provide

##### He Was Incapable of Attending to Instruction without Disrupting the Class

##### He Was Extremely Unhappy with the Situation and Rules Being Imposed on Him for the sake of the Others

##### Since He Was the only One there with an Aide, He Became even More Aware of His Differences and Deficiencies

##### After Several Weeks of Watching This Disaster Unfold, Our Friends Asked the School to Put Him back in a Special Class

#### For Students that Are More Severe, Special Classes Are Generally Better

##### The School System We Were in Would place Our Son in Classes with Typical Children as He Could Handle It, but provided the More Structured Environment when He Could not

##### This Hybrid Solution is Generally Better for Those Who Need More Help

### People Imagine Inclusive Learning Will Somehow Cure Their Child

#### It's a Solution Born of Denial rather than an Objective Evaluation of What's Best for the Child

#### They Believe Their Special Child with Observe Typical Children and Magically Take on Their Characteristics

#### They Believe Their Child Will Be Accepted as part of the Social Group and Be an Integral part of Classroom Activities

#### In Short, They Believe Inclusive Learning Will Cure Their Child and Solve All Their Problems

#### Since Those Outcomes Are not Very Likely, it Shouldn't Be Surprising it Often Doesn't Turn out Well.

## My Son Has no Friends

### My Son Maintains no Relationships outside of the Family

#### He Can't Carry on a Conversation like a Typical Adult

#### He is Fortunate if He Can Maintain a 3-4 Interaction exchange with a Kind and Understanding Stranger

#### He Has no Concept of Social Cues, Body Language, or the Whole Range of Ways People Communicate

#### He Has no Interest in Playing with Friends, Hanging Out, or Spending time with Peers

#### He Likes to Play Video Games, but Mostly the Solitary Ones

### My Son is My Best Friend

#### I End up Giving Him the Social Experience He Would Ordinarily Be Having with Others

#### I Take Him Everywhere I Go, and He Participates in Every Activity I Do

#### I Listen to Every Word He Says, even when He is Spouting Complete Nonsense

##### In Fact, This is One of My Spiritual Practices

##### When James Recites a Script

###### I Could Feel Bored with the lack of Content

###### I Could Feel Sad that His Mind Lacks Content

###### I Could Go down Those Rabbit Holes over and over Again

##### Whenever I Hear Him Speak, I Feel Thankful because there Was a time when We Didn't Know if He Would Ever Speak

##### We Know other Families whose Children Are Completely Non-verbal

#### My Son Has no Shortage of Social Interaction with Me and His Family

### He is Surrounded by Loving Family

#### And after We Die, He Will Have Loving Caregivers

#### But He Will Never Have Long-term Relationships, Friends, Lovers, or People in His Life that Aren't Family or Paid Help

#### That is the Reality of Who He is

## Special versus High-functioning

### My Son is Special

#### Due to His lack of Language and Social Skills, it Takes only One Interaction for People to Realize His Limitations

##### When We Moved from One County to Another within Our State, We Needed to Be Interviewed for Verification of Ongoing Services

##### The Examiners Are Trained to Look for Fraud, so They Are Looking for Those Who Exaggerate Their Disabilities to Gain Government Assistance

##### When the Worker Interviewed My Son at Our Home, He Asked My Son about His Care at Our New home

###### He Replied in His Rapid Manner "googleplex, Googleplex Black, White, New Earth, Hubble Telescope 4.5 Billion Years Old, Sun Biting Earth, Red and Blue Make Purple, save it until 2080, yes!"

###### The "yes" at the End is Generally Exclaimed with Gusto

###### Our Services Transfer Was Approved without Delay

#### Being Special Generally means People Give Him the Benefit of Accommodating His Limitations

##### Nobody Confuses Him for a Typical Adult with Capabilities for Independence

##### This Puts Lower Expectations on Him and Makes People Prone to Forgive Him for failing to Conform to Social Norms

##### Realistically, This Has Made Our Life and His much Easier

### The Challenge of Specialness without Special Consideration

#### My Observation is that the Higher Functioning Children Have a Greater Challenge

##### They Need to Interact in a Typical World, but They lack the Skills to Do so Effectively

##### They Have Stronger Desire for Family and Friends but Difficulties in Obtaining and Sustaining Them

##### Higher Functioning Adults Obtain Fewer Services

##### Many Are Expected to Hold down Jobs

###### But They Often lack the Skills to Sustain Themselves in the Workforce

##### They Are More Likely to Be Victims of Scams and Predatory Lending

##### They Often End up in Undesirable Circumstances with Substandard Housing, Poor Healthcare, and Limited Resources, Sometimes in the Clutches of Exploitive People

##### Our Capitalist System Designed to Force Lazy People to Work Ends up Subjecting Those with Special Needs to Undue Hardships

## Incidents with Strangers

### The German Tourists

#### When My Son Was Seven Years Old, We Attended a Family Reunion.

#### Many of the Out-of-town Visitors, including My Family, Stayed at the Same Hotel

#### On Saturday Morning, about 20 of Us Met up at the Continental Breakfast

#### Besides the 20 of Us, the only other People in the Room Were Two Older German Tourists

#### My Son Was Going from One Family Member to Another and Hugging Them

#### He Wasn't Accustomed to Being around so Many People He Could Hug at One Time, so He Was Making the Most of it

#### He Hadn't Seen Many of These Relatives More than once or Twice, so He Lacked Perfect Knowledge about Which of These People Were Related to Him and Which Ones Were not

#### As He Made His way around the Room, He Stopped and Hugged the Arm of the Lady from Germany

#### She Got Annoyed, and I Apologized to Her that He Didn't Realize She Wasn't Family because Every other Person in that Room Was

#### A Few Minutes Later, He Did it Again, and She Became Very Angry

#### She Launched into a Lecture on how We Should Keep Control of Our Unruly Child

#### She Was Correct. We Had not Stopped Him from Hugging Her Arm Twice

#### But Was the Lecture Really Necessary?

#### Was His Hug so Offensive that She Needed to Express Her Anger in an Outburst of near Rage?

#### Could She not See that He Was Special and Meant no Offense and no Harm?

#### Were We Leaning on the "he is special" Defense and We Should Have Been More Careful to Stop Him?

#### Perhaps. If We Had Realized She Was such a Battle Ax, We Certainly Would Have Kept Him as far away from Her as Possible

#### But it Was Hard for Us to Imagine that a Loving Child Giving out Hugs to His Family Could Be so Offensive

#### I Found Myself Working to Feel Compassion for Her Imagining She Must not Be Accustomed to Love and Warm Feelings and Reacted out of Jealousy

#### The Incident Ruined the Day for My Wife

#### She Wife Was Convinced the Old Lady Was just a Crusty Bitch with no Redeeming Qualities

#### I Found it Difficult to Convince Her Otherwise

#### And at the Time, I Probably Agreed with Her, so Any Council Would Have Been Half-hearted

### The End of My Illusions of His Independence

#### I Used to Allow Him to Go on a Specific Theme Park Ride by Himself

##### He Was Capable of Waiting in line and Holding His place and following Staff Instructions

##### A Well-supervised Theme Park Seemed like a Safe place to Allow Him Some Freedom

##### Unfortunately, an Incident Occurred while He Was in line

##### Since I Was not there as a Witness, I Could not Defend Him

##### Since His Answers to Questions Are not Reliable, He Couldn't Defend Himself

#### When I Realized He Could not Defend Himself against Accusations of Wrongdoing

##### He Could Never Be Left Alone and Unsupervised

##### I Denied This Truth to Myself for a long time

###### I Wanted to Believe He Could Have Some Measure of Independence

###### I Think Every Parent Wants to Believe Their Child Can Gain Independence

###### My Attachment to My Desire for His Independence Fed My Denial

###### My Denial Caused Me to Make a Poor Decision that Put My Son in a Set of Circumstances He Was not Capable of Handling on His Own

###### It Was a Hard Lesson to Learn

### The "in Your face" Hello

#### Despite His lack of Success, My Son Still Longs to Connect with People, even if only for a Brief Moment

#### When We Are out in Public, He is Prone to Say Hello to Random Strangers while Vigorously Waiving His hands

#### His hello/goodbye Waive is not as Polished and Practiced as the British Queen, but what He Lacks in Technique, He Makes up for in Enthusiasm

#### I Try to Give Him Council to Wait until Someone is Making Eye contact with Him and Smiling, and He Certainly Gets More Positive Responses when He Does That, but He Still Often Says "hi" to People Who Are not Paying Attention to Him, Completely Catching Them off Guard.

#### My Son is an Introvert like His Parents, but the Extrovert Makes an Appearance when He's in a Particularly Good Mood and We're Walking around in Public.

## Accept Us or Go away

### The More Extroverted You Are, the More Difficult This Chapter Probably Was for You to Accept

### There Are Undeniably Social Limitations when You Have a Special Needs Child

### We Follow a Simple Rule that We Believe Has Saved Us time and Effort on False Friends

#### We Socialize as a Family Most of the time

#### If My Son is not Welcome at a Family Event, We Don't want to Be there either

#### My Wife and I Are not Going to an Event with other Children and not Bring Ours

#### And because We Mostly Met Parents Who also Had Special Needs Children, This Generally Worked out

#### In Those Instances Were We Passed on Activities, I Never Felt Remorse or Wonder if We just Missed Making Lifelong Friends

##### How Could I Sustain a Friendship with Someone Who Can't Abide My Son?

#### While This Practice May Have Limited Our Social Life, it Think it Limited it for the Better

### Learning to Manage the Behavior of a Child with Special Needs

### The Advice of Experts

#### The Most Important Parenting Lessons Were Taught to Us by the Early Aba Therapists that Worked with My Son

#### We Were Fortunate to Have These Experts

#### If for no other Reason, They Helped Settle Disputes between My Wife and I about how We Should Deal with My Son

#### My Wife Thought I Was Too Hard on Him, Demanding that He Learn to Do Things for Himself that He Wasn't Capable of

#### I Thought She Was Being Too Easy on Him, Doing Everything for Him and Holding Him back

#### If not for These Third-party Experts to provide Us Some Guidance, My Wife and I Would Have Fought More, Struggled More with My Son, and He Would Have Suffered because of it

#### The Two Opposing Forces of Independence and Dependence Are part of Every Parent's Struggle, but These Issues Get More Complicated when Special Needs Are Involved because It's More Difficult to Determine what the Child is Capable of

### Managing Our Son's Behavior Can Be Distilled to a Few Simple Principles

#### Learn the Rules of Engagement

#### Reinforce, Ignore, or Crack down

#### Don't Reward what You Don't want

#### Learn to Use the Current Currency

#### Don't Let Anger or Anxiety Grow

#### You Can't Give Too much Love and Affection

### Understand the Rules of Engagement

#### The Military Has a Sequence of Provocations, Responses, and Counter-responses They Call the Rules of Engagement

#### These Rules Govern the Circumstances, Conditions, Degree, and Manner in Which the Use of a Parent's Authority May Be Applied.

#### Parents All Develop Rules of Engagement, though Rarely Are They Recognized as such

#### With Special Needs Children These Rules Need to Be Understood by Everyone and Applied Consistently to provide the Structure Special Needs Children Need

##### Special Needs Children Tend to Be Rule Followers

##### They Usually Don't Have the Understanding Needed to Be Clever or Push the Boundaries

##### Most Hare Happy just to Learn the Rules and Follow Them

#### Most of the Concepts that Follow Are part of the Rules of Engagement

### Learn to Use the Current Currency

#### The Current Currency is whatever Your Child Wants Today

##### Necessities Are Never Currency

###### We Never Withhold Food or Water or Failed to Keep Him or His Surroundings Clean and Safe

###### You Might Think This Should Go without Saying, But....

##### Preferred Foods

##### Toys, Games

##### Books, Videos

##### Favorite Activities

##### Promise of Future Events

##### And Every Child Has Preferences and They Are All Different

#### Currency Can also Be Future Events or Things Your Child is Working for

##### Our Son Thinks about the Future

##### He Delays Gratification

##### He Conserves Resources for Future Use

##### Is Motivated to Gain Major Future Events

#### Use Current Currency for Shaping Behavior

##### Reinforce Good Behavior by providing Currency

##### Threaten to Withhold Currency to Compel compliance

##### Withhold or Remove Currency as Punishment for Willful Disobedience

#### Know the Difference between a Mistake and a Bad Choice

##### The outward Behavior is not Nearly as Important as the inward Motivation

##### Special Needs Children Make Lots of Mistakes due to Their Diminished Cognitive Functioning

###### My Son is Prone to Worry He Has Been a "bad boy" when He Makes a Mistake

###### This is Often a Cause of Anxiety for Him

###### He Identifies a Bit Too Strongly with Being a "good boy"

###### He is not Punished for Mistakes in Behavior Committed out of Ignorance

###### Even if He Has Been Told in the past

###### He Often Forgets what He Has Been Told

###### He is Punished for Bad Choices

###### When He Knows Better and Chooses to Do Something Wrong Anyway

###### Bad Choices, Engaging in Behaviors He Knows is against the Rules, That's what Prompts Punishment

###### With Special Needs, It's Easy to Tell the Difference

###### With Typical Children, They Learn how to Lie Effectively

###### Special Needs Children Are Poor Liars with Too Many Tells

###### It's Very Difficult for a Special Needs Child to Convince a Typical Adult a Willfully Chosen Behavior Was an Ignorant Mistake

##### Punishing Mistakes Will only Frustrate Your Child because They Won't Understand what They Did Wrong

###### That Doesn't Motivate Good Choices

###### The Need to Parse the Difference between an Ignorant Mistake and Willful Disobedience is Paramount

#### The Promise and Perils of Food as a Reinforcement

##### Is Most Common and Most Relevant Reinforcer

##### It's Nearly Impossible not to Use it to Some Degree

###### My Son is Highly Motivated to Work for Treats

###### These Are Mostly Small Things with Few Calories

###### We Use Them because They Are effective

##### Can Lead to Problems with Overeating and Weight Gain

### Reinforce, Ignore, or Crack down

#### Anything that Your Child Does that You Have an Opinion about Requires You to Take One of Three Actions

##### Reinforce

##### Ignore

##### Crack down

#### What You Reinforce Gets Repeated

##### Any Behavior that Ends with a Child Finding Pleasure or Getting what They want Will Be Repeated

##### Reinforcement Can come in Many Forms

###### It Can Be the Current Currency

###### It Can Be as Simple as a Smile from a Parent or a Laugh

###### Anything that Pleases Your Child Can Reinforce Behavior

#### Be Very Careful about what Your Reinforce

##### Don't Reward what You Don't want

##### Any Behavior that Ends with a Child Getting what They want Will Be Repeated

##### This Can Lead to Extreme Behavior

###### I Remember Spending a Day with Another Family that Was Having Trouble with Their Special Needs Son Who Was about 8 at the time

###### I Watched This Child Ask Repeatedly for Things, Dozens upon Dozens of times

###### The Parents Would Say no but They Wouldn't Dissuade Him from Asking

###### The Child Escalated to Screaming, Yelling, and Making Outbursts

###### Then the Parents Caved in and Gave Him what He Wanted

###### When I Saw Them Give in to Their childâ€™s Demands after a Dozen "noâ€™s" and a Tantrum, I Could See why They Had a Problem

###### They Showed Him what Was Required to Get to "yes" and He Was Going through the Whole Routine whenever He Wanted Something Bad Enough

##### My Wife and I Joke about "not Giving in to Terrorist demands"

###### Easier for Me

###### Harder for His Mother

#### What You Ignore Fades away

##### Ignoring a Minor Annoyance is Always the Better Option

###### There is no Ill Will Generated by Ignoring Minor Annoyances

###### Cracking down and Resorting to Punishment Creates Tension and Bad Feelings, so it Should Be Employed only when Really Needed

##### Ignoring Can Be Challenging as Children Will Often Repeat Behaviors or Become More Persistent to Elicit a Reaction

###### My Son Got in the Habit of Unrolling Entire Rolls of Toilet Paper just to Get the Little Cardboard Tube out of it

###### He Would Bring Them to Show Me because One time I Made the Mistake of Laughing

###### I Had to Ignore This Behavior a Dozen or More times until it Stopped

###### He Would come over to Me and Put the Empty Toilet Rolls Right in My Face to Make Sure I Saw Them

###### It Wasn't Worth Cracking down On, as it Was only a Matter of Wasting Toilet Paper

###### But it Wasn't Something I Wanted Him to Keep Doing as He Started Wasting Toilet Paper at His Grandparents House

##### Calling Attention to Something Often Becomes Reinforcing

###### Attention Itself is Considered Positive and Reinforces Behavior

##### Cracking down on Small Things Makes it Harder to Be effective in Cracking down on Major Problems

#### Cracking down is to Make a Behavior Stop Entirely

##### The Parent Makes it Known that Continuing or Repeating the Behavior Will Have Negative Consequences

##### Cracking down Should Be Used Sparingly to Be effective

#### Cracking down Has It's Own Escalating Rules of Engagement

##### Warn First by Threatening to Withhold Objects of Desire

##### Try to Make the Punishment Fit the Infraction

##### If the Child Escalates, Punish by Taking away Some Current Currency

#### Cracking down with the Authoritarian Voice

##### There is a Tone of Voice with Strong Authority I Employ only on the Rarest Occasions

###### If He is in Imminent Danger, and I Am not Holding on to Him, I Need a way to Compel Immediate compliance

###### For Example, if We Are Walking in a Parking Lot, and He Isn't Aware of a Car that Poses Him Danger, I Need to Get Him to Stop and Pay Attention to Me or the Danger

###### This Firm and Loud Voice Stands Out, and He Knows to Pay Attention Immediately when He Hears it

##### I'm not a Proponent of Yelling and Using Fear to Compel Compliance, but I Will Resort to that if Need Be

#### Cracking down with Violence

##### I Can Honestly Say I Have Never Hit My Son, Certainly Never in Anger

##### However, I Have Had Occasion to Subdue Him with Physical Force

##### By Nature and Nurture My Son is not Aggressive or Prone to Becoming Angry

###### He Has Never Acted Violently toward Others because He Didn't Get what He Wanted or because of Something Someone Did or Said to Him

###### He Has Never Harmed Another Person

##### Whenever My Son is Overwhelmed with Anxiety, He is Capable of Losing Self Control

###### He Becomes Very Frustrated if He is Chastised when He Believes He is following the Rules

###### He Strongly Identifies with Being a Good Boy Who Follows the Rules

###### If He is Yelled at for not following the Rules when Be Believes He Is, He Feels like there is no way to Avoid Punishment, and He Gets Very Anxious

###### He Believes He is Being Falsely Accused

###### On Rare Occasions This Has Turned Violent

###### He Got out of Control at High School Once, and when My Wife Arrived to Pick Him Up, the School Security Guard Was Actively Restraining Him

###### He Got Upset with His Mother on a Couple of Occasions and Squeezed Her Too Hard Causing Her Pain

###### I Had to Intervene and Physically Restrain Him

##### I Did not Hurt My Son when I Restrained Him, but I Did Have to Use Physical Force to Prevent Him from Hurting His Mother

##### He Doesn't Live in Fear of Physical Violence, but He also Knows He Will not Be Able to Use Violence to Get what He Wants

#### Cracking down with Fear of Loss

##### The Most Difficult Decision I Face with My Son is what to Teach Him about His Violence

##### Realistically, He Will Always Be Welcome to Live with My Wife and Myself, but We Can't Live in Fear of what He Might Do

###### If He Becomes Aggressive or Violent toward Us, We Won't Be Able to Keep Him in Our home

###### This is a Simple Truth

###### If I Tell My Son the Truth, it May Contribute to His Anxiety and Cause Situations to Get out of Control

###### If I Don't Tell My Son the Truth, He May Do Something Bad because He Didn't Understand the Consequences of His Actions

##### After the Last Incident, Quite Some time Ago, when He Hurt His Mother, I Decided to Explain to Him Exactly what Might Happen if He Does it Again

###### I Explained is as Clearly and as Calmly as I Could so He Didn't Take it as Threatening

###### He Understands that Living with Strangers is not as Desirable as Living with His Mom and Dad

###### He Doesn't want to Lose His Current Life Circumstances

###### What I Noticed afterward Was Encouraging to Me

##### He Developed a Healthy Remorse for Hurting His Mother

###### Some Regrets Are not Bad

###### Being Sorry and Expressing Remorse is a Positive Feeling That's there to Prevent You from Repeating Mistakes

###### He Deeply Regrets Hurting His Mother

###### He Speaks about it Often

###### "good Boy not Hurting momma"

###### He Feels Genuine Remorse over what He Did, and He Reminds Himself of His Mistake so as not to Repeat it

###### We Tell Him It's Okay and He Has Been Forgiven

###### But I Appreciate that He Carries that Healthy Regret because if He Ever Losses Control Again, that Feeling Will Be the only Thing Preventing Him from Making a Terrible Mistake

### Four Strikes and Your out

#### If My Son Asks for Something We Can Easily Give and there is no Harm, We Immediately Say Yes

##### He Doesn't Need to Ask a Second time

##### And We Don't want Him to Form the Habit of Repeating Requests

#### If My Son Asks for Something We Will Give Later but We Can't provide Now, He is Willing to Accept a Delayed Yes

##### He Will Refrain from Asking Again until the time is Right or the Precondition is Met

##### He Has Learned Patience and Delayed Gratification

#### Children Never Take no for an Answer the First time if They Really want Something

##### If My Son Wants Something We Don't want for Him, We Will Say no

###### At that Point, the Rules of Engagement Depend on Him

##### If His Desire Isn't that Strong, He Will Forget about it and not Ask Again

##### If He Really Wants Something, He Will Ask Again

###### This is how He Expresses His Stronger Desire to Us

##### We Will then Reconsider Our no and See if Our Reasons Were Sound

###### If Our Reasons Were not that Strong, not as Strong as His Desire, We Will Give in and Change Our Answer to Yes

###### If Our Reasons Were Strong, We Will Repeat the no and Offer the Reasons for Saying no

###### With a Typical Child, This Would Be where the Debate Starts, but with a Special Needs Child, there Generally Isn't much Debate

##### After the Second no is when Crazy Things Can Happen

###### Any Child Who Has Learned a Method of Obtaining what They want Will Start that Script now

###### Crying, Tantrums, Yelling, Punching, Pleading, Anything that Has Been Rewarded in the past with a "yes" Will Happen at This point

#### The "no nagging" Rule

##### Asking over and over Again is the Most Common way Children Get what They want

##### The Third time My Son Asks for Something, We Will Tell Him no Nagging, and He Knows It's time to Stop

##### Over the Years, We Taught Him Most of the Words out of the Thesaurus for Nagging

###### Our Favorite is Badgering, We Actually Say no Badgering Most Often

###### He Came up with no Repeating

###### His Grandmother Added no Browbeating

###### His Great Aunt Came up with no Haranguing

###### One of My Favorites as there is an Element of Aggressiveness to Nagging

##### It's such a Common Ending that We've Made a Game of it

##### The only Reason it Stops there is because He Knows that after He Asks a Third Time, He Will Be Reminded that if He Keeps Asking, He Will Lose Treats, His Favorite Currency

#### This Rule is Called Four Strikes and Your out because the Punishments Start on the Fourth Request

##### The Third Strike is when the Warning Comes that He Must Stop Asking or He Loses Currency

##### If He Asks a Fourth Time, He is Told He is Losing Currency

###### At This Point, He Often Begs Forgiveness and Promises to Stop Asking in Hopes of Restoring the Currency

###### We Usually Give in so that He Sees the Value of Forgiveness

##### If He Doesn't Ask for Forgiveness, or if He Asks for Something a Fifth Time, He Loses Currency

###### This Punishment is Always Applied, so He is Certain that if He Travels This far down the Rules of Engagement, He Knows He Will Find an Outcome He Does not want

#### This Has Proven Extremely effective over the Years at Allowing My Son to Obtain what He Wants with a Minimum of Stress and Hassle for Him or for Us

### Don't Let Anger or Anxiety Grow

#### By far the Most Challenging Issue We Have with Our Son is with Anxiety

#### Staying Calm is Essential to Maintaining Emotional Control

##### People Lose Control of Their Reasoning and Behavior with Intoxication or Extreme Emotional Upset

##### Anger is Particularly Problematic for Loss of Control, but Anxiety is also a Significant Stressor

##### Once Those Emotions Take Over, It's like a Forest Fire that Gets Stronger as it Finds More Fuel and Burns out of Control

##### A Reliable Defense against These Strong Emotions is the Practice Calming

###### Breaking the Cycle of Upset and Engaging in Behaviors Specifically to Prevent the Emotions from Growing Stronger and Taking Control

#### He is not on Any Medications, so He is Excitable and Full of Energy

##### He is Prone to Get Excited and Flap His hands Vigorously, a Common Behavior among Autistic Individuals

##### When He is Pleased by Something, He Experience a Flush of Joy

###### We Don't want to Inhibit This Feeling, Which is One of the Reasons We Don't Drug Him

###### Sometimes when I See how much Joy He Feels over Simple Things, I Actually Feel Jealous Which Quickly Turns to Rejoicing

#### When He Believes He Did Something Wrong, He Gets Upset, like Most of Us Do

##### However, with Him, He Doesn't Have a Wide Range of Coping Strategies, so This Upset Can Easily Escalate

##### He is Particularly Triggered when He Believes He is Being Chastised when He Thought He Was following the Rules

###### Again, Any of Us Would Get Upset if We Were Falsely Accused of Something

###### But He Can Take Ordinary Misunderstandings and Turn it into a Meltdown

#### Devastating Losses of Control

##### When My Son Losses Self-control, the Result is Emotionally Devastating to Our Family

##### He Gets over it Almost Immediately, I Get over it Quickly, but His Mother Finds it More Difficult to Recover from

##### We Had One Episode while I Was Writing This Book

###### We Were Eating Lunch at a Restaurant prior to a Planned Afternoon Activity

###### At the End of His Meal, I Was Seated next to Him, and He Gave Me a Hug

###### He Had not Cleaned His Hands, so He Wiped Food All over My White Sleeves

###### I Expressed My Disappointment with what He Had Done, not Angrily or in a Hurtful Way, but He Had no Doubt about My Displeasure with the Mess He Created

###### He Became Upset as He Thought He Was Being Kind and Loving, and He Didn't Get the Reaction He Was Hoping for

###### It Was My Fault for Reacting Poorly, but once Set in Motion, Events Quickly Spiraled out of Control

###### He Reached across the Table and Squeezed His Mother's Arms Hard to Express His Anger

###### Then He Injured Himself because He Knew it Would Upset Us

###### Despite Being a Public Restaurant, I Had to Reach across the Table and Break His Grip from His Mother's Forearms

###### My Wife Had the Presence of Mind to Get Him to Yoga Breath to Calm Down, Which He Did

###### He Started Pleading about how Sorry He Was, but the Damage Was Already Done

###### My Wife Was Upset and Told Me that I Needed to Include that Story in the Book

###### She Added that the Entire Book Was just My Fantasy and Our Lives Really Aren't that Great

##### Living with a Special Needs Child or Adult Has Its Rewards, but it is not All Rainbows and Unicorns

###### We Have Struggles

###### We Try to Muddle through Making the Best Decisions We Can

###### We Try to Overcome All Obstacles with Love and Understanding

###### Some Days Are Still Better than Others

#### We Have Learned to Apply Behavioral Techniques to Help Him Remain Calm

##### Yoga Breathing

###### Surprisingly Enough, He Understands the Idea of Yoga Breathing

###### He Knows to Stop and Take Some Slow Deep Breaths when He's Getting Upset

###### He Will Proactively Calm Himself when He Starts to Feel Upset

##### Calm, Happy, Relaxed

###### We Have Taught Him a Mantra to Help Him Remember what He's Trying to Accomplish

###### He Will Say, "calm, Happy, relaxed" and Take Deep Breaths

###### These Two Techniques together Are effective and Defusing Most Disturbances

##### Apply at the Earliest Opportunity

###### Disturbing Emotions Build in Strength All on Their Own

###### Like a Fire that Begins from a Single Spark, Emotional Upset Can Spark from a Single Small Incident

###### And like a Fire, It's much Easier to Extinguish when It's just a Spark instead of a Full-blown Inferno

## A Wayward Son

### Quote

#### Carry on Wayward Son

# Song by Kansas

## Once I Rose above the Noise and Confusion

## Just to Get a Glimpse beyond This Illusion

## I Was Soaring Ever Higher

## But I Flew Too High

## Though My Eyes Could See, I Still Was a Blind Man

## Though My Mind Could Think, I Still Was a Mad Man

## I Hear the Voices when Iâ€™m Dreaming

## I Can Hear Them Say

## â€¦ Carry On, My Wayward Son

## There'll Be Peace when You Are Done

## Lay Your Weary Head to Rest

## Don't You Cry no More

## Reluctant Road to Accepting Defeat

### Resignation to Lifelong Care

#### We Knew Early on My Son Would Never Gain Independence

##### The only Real Question Was what We Were Going to Do about it

##### Neither of Us Wanted to Put Him in an Institution, so We Knew We Were Destined to Be Lifelong Care Givers

##### At the Time, it Was Resignation to Something Undesirable

###### This Wasn't what either of Us Wanted

###### But it Was Our Duty as His Parents, and We Knew We Were Going to See it through

#### There Wasn't Any Joy in the Idea

##### It Was a Weight around My Neck

##### My Wife Joked about Being a Maid for Life

##### Neither of Us Had Opened Our Minds and Hearts to the Opportunity Presented to Us

#### Malaise of Accepting the Negative

##### I Felt I Was Being Forced to Accept Something Substandard, not Good

##### Sense of Doom and Depression

##### It Never Occurred to Me to Look for the Unique Goodness in My Circumstances

#### I Deeply Understood that Resignation is not Acceptance

##### I Tried to Claim I Accepted My Son and My Life Circumstances, but I Really Didn't

##### I Would Have Changed My Circumstances if that Were Possible

##### I Was Resisting what Was, and Still is

##### When I Realized That, I Knew that Resignation Wasn't Acceptance

#### Resignation is Still Resistance

##### I Decided that Accepting the Negative Wasn't the Right Answer

##### It Wasn't a Call to Strengthen My Denial

##### I Needed to Reframe how I Viewed the Situation

###### Redefining Victory

##### The Alternative Was Lifelong Unhappiness

###### There is Supposed to Be a way to Be Happy Irrespective of Circumstances

###### Not that I Knew how to Do that

###### But it Gave Me Hope that there Was an Answer

### Not Accepting Your Child as Broken

#### Many Parents Believe that Accepting Their Special Needs Child is Accepting Defeat

##### They Accept the Condition Exists but view Their Child as Broken and Defective

###### This is the Final Trap that Catches All but a Few Lucky Parents

###### It's the Default Condition when All Denial is Exhausted

##### The Purpose of Acceptance is not to Grin an Bear it

##### You Are not Looking for the Sliver of Good in Something Overwhelmingly Bad

#### Heroic Stories of Acceptance Often Miss the point

##### Most of the Books on Autism Propagate the view that Autistic Children Are Broken and Need to Be Fixed

##### A Recent Trend in These Books is to Glorify Stories from Parents Who Accept Their Broken Children

##### These Acceptance Stories Portray the Parents as Heroic

###### After All, They Must Endure Something Really Awful, Right?

##### If They Accept Their Broken Child, They've Failed to Recognize that Their Child Was Never Broken to Begin with

#### Your Child is not Broken. You Are.

##### Did You Have a Reaction to that Idea?

##### Did it Make You Angry that I Suggested that You Might Be the Broken One?

##### How Does it Make You Feel to Be Viewed as the Broken One?

###### Is it Pleasant?

###### Do You Feel Accepted or Uplifted?

##### How Does Your Child Feel Every time You Look into Their Eyes and They Know You Think They Are Broken, Defective, not Acceptable, not Lovable?

#### You Must Change how You view Your Child

##### There is no Acceptance while You view Your Child as Broken

##### Children Do not Need to Conform to Some Neurotypical Standard Set by You or by Others

##### You Must Learn to view Them as Perfect, or Perfectly Acceptable just the way They Are

### Accepting My Special Needs Child Was the Answer to My Own Spiritual quest

#### My Son Had to Be the Key

##### He is a Source of Strong Emotions

##### My Emotions Were Conflicted Which Serves as a Disturbance to Peace of Mind

##### There Was no Joy and Happiness unless I Found a way to Overcome My Grief

#### However, I Was Trapped in the Negative Judgments from My Initial Reaction to the Diagnosis

#### I Defined My Problem as the Need to Accept the Bad

##### I Was Supposed to Acquire a Taste for Shitburgers

#### I Couldn't Conceive of Another way

#### I Didn't Realize that I Had Made a Mistake Years Ago, when I First Realized My Son Was Special

##### I Made a Natural Reactive Judgment that My Son's Condition Was Bad

##### That Bad Judgment Was Never Questioned

##### It provided a Conceptual Framework to Interpret Everything that Followed

##### I Had Created a Prison in My Own Mind, and I Was Trapped inside it

##### Since I Didn't Know I Was Trapped in a Mistaken Belief, I Couldn't See a way out of My Dilemma

## Acceptance is the Opponent to Anger and Resentment

### Acceptance is a Mind that Welcomes whatever Occurs without Resistance

#### We Constantly Make Judgments about what We Want, what We Don't Want, and when We want it

#### These Judgments Set up the Conditions for Disappointment and for Anger to Arise

#### The Stronger Our Preferences, the Stronger Our Reaction Will Be when Things Don't Turn out as We want

#### The Mind of Acceptance Has no Strongly Held Preferences with no Importance on Fulfillment

#### The Characteristics of a Mind of Acceptance

##### Acceptance is the opposite of Resistance

##### Acceptance is to Wholeheartedly Accept Things Exactly as They Are and not want for Circumstances to Be Any Different

###### This Was the Definition of Acceptance that Changed My Life

### Acceptance Requires Two Related Spiritual Practices

#### A Mind of Non-judgment

#### A Mind of Non-attachment

#### It's Difficult to Obtain and Sustain a Mind of Acceptance without the other Two Practices

### How Non-judgment Supports Acceptance

#### The Three Conditions that Generate Anger Require a Judgment as to What's Desirable or Undesirable

##### When You Obtain Something You Want, You Judge it to Be Good

##### If You Fail to Obtain Something You Want, You Judge it to Be Bad

##### If You Obtain Something You Don't Want, You Judge it to Be Bad

##### If You Don't Make the Good or Bad Judgement, whatever You Obtain or Fail to Obtain, Doesn't Have the Power to Upset You

##### If You Don't Put much Importance behind the Judgment, whatever Occurs Doesn't Have the Ability to Upset You either

##### With a Mind of Non-judgment, even what Most Would Consider Dire Circumstances Won't Disrupt Your Peace of Mind

#### Acceptance Makes no Judgments about Good or Bad that Would Trigger Attachment or Aversion

#### Acceptance Revels in Pleasure without Clutching after it and Endures Pain or Pushing it away

#### Acceptance Takes whatever Comes and Ignores the Rest

### How Non-attachment Supports Acceptance

#### If You Clutch after Objects, You Will Become Distraught when It's Consumed or Lost

#### If You Cling to People, You Will Become Upset when They Fail to Meet Your Expectations or Leave You

#### Whether it Be Objects or People, if You Lose Something That's Important You, You Will Suffer due to Your Attachment

#### If You Don't Resist the Loss, if You Accept whatever Happens

##### The Loss May Sadden You, but it Won't Be a Cause of Suffering

##### And You Won't Get Angry about it

## Impermanence Overcomes Attachment

### We All Form Attachments

#### Whenever You Obtain a Resource You Feel is Important, whether This Be a Person, place or Thing, Your Naturally Don't want to Lose it

#### Parting is not Sweet Sorrow

#### Losing Something You Value is Painful

##### Digesting This Loss Requires Enduring Sadness

##### Resisting the Loss Makes it Worse and Leads to Suffering

#### The Sting of Attachment Comes in other Forms as well

##### Sometimes You Obtain Things You Didn't Want, like an Illness

##### Sometimes You Fail to Obtain the Thing at All, Creating Disappointment

#### The Most Common Reaction to Loss is Anger, Resisting what Is, and Avoiding Accepting Reality

### How to Avoid Forming Attachment

#### Meditating on Death and the Facts Surrounding Death is the Cornerstone of Addressing Attachment

#### In Addition, it Serves to Motivate You to Focus on What's Really Important rather than Wasting Effort on Worldly Concerns

##### I Meditate on Death Often, and for a Time, it Was a Primary Practice

##### Meditation on Death Changed My Life

###### I Devote My time and Energy to My Son because of the Death Meditation

###### I Stopped Pursuing Extraneous Worldly Concerns that Were Largely Motivated by the Desire to Make More Money and Consume More

###### I Stopped Chasing Fame, Fortune, or Status of Any Kind

###### I Still provide for My Family, but I Do it for Them, not for Me

###### I Learned a Key Lesson about Impermanence, Which Helps Me with My Attachments

### You Are Going to Die

#### Mostly, We Go through Life Seeking Objects of Our Desire, Laboring under the False Idea that Happiness Can Be Found in Wealth, Status, or a Good Reputation. We Expend Tremendous Amounts of Energy toward Obtaining Things and Attaching Ourselves to Them, only to Find Disappointment when These Things Don't Bring Us the Happiness We Desire.

#### You've Heard the Expression, "you Can't Take it with you." and We All Intellectually Know that to Be True, but Do We Really Live Our Lives as if it Were True?

#### Consider the following Story:

##### Some Children Were Playing beside a River. They Made Castles of Sand, and Each Child Defended His Castle and Said, â€˜this One is mine.' They Kept Their Castles Separate and Would not Allow Any Mistakes about Which Was Whose. When the Castles Were All Finished, One Child Kicked over Someone Else's Castle and Completely Destroyed It. The Owner of the Castle Flew into a Rage, Pulled the other Child's Hair, Struck Him with His Fist and Bawled Out, â€˜he Has Spoiled My Castle! Come along All of You and Help Me Punish Him as He deserves.' the Others All Came to His Help. They Beat the Child â€¦ then They Went on Playing in Their Sand Castles, Each Saying, â€˜this is Mine; no One Else May Have It. Keep Away! Don't touch My castle!'

##### But Evening Came, it Was Getting Dark and They All Thought They Ought to Be Going Home. No One now Cared what Became of His Castle. One Child Stamped on His, Another Pushed His over with both Hands. Then They Turned away and Went Back, Each to His Home.

#### Do We Act Any Differently than These Children? We Live Our Lives Building Castles in the Sand only to Leave Them behind as Meaningless when the long Night of Death Falls.

#### Imagine for a Moment that You Accomplished Everything You Wanted in Life. You Succeeded in All Your Worldly Affairs. Perhaps You're Jeff Bezos and You've Accumulated a $100 Billion Fortune. Or Perhaps You're Tom Brady and You Won Seven Super Bowls. While These Are Amazing Accomplishments, both of Those Men Will Die, and when They Do, They Won't Be Taking Any of Their Wealth or Attainments with Them. In Fact, if They Cling to Their Attainments on Their Deathbed, They Will Feel Anguish and Sorrow, and They Will Endure a Great Deal of Suffering. How Will Their Worldly Attainments Benefit Them Then?

#### You Are Going to Die. You Could Die Today. None of Your Worldly Attainments or Possessions Are Important. You Won't Be Taking Any of it with You.

#### Shortly after Your Death, Your Possessions Will Be Disbursed to Various People, and Your Corpse Will Be Disposed Of. A Form of You Remains in the Memories of Those Who Knew You. Those Who Outlive You May Remember You Kindly, or They May Not. You May Have a Memorial Headstone, or no Permanent Record of You May Exist at All. Everything You Worked For, Struggled Against, Hoped, Dreamed, Felt - Everything Will Be Summarized by a Dash between the Dates on Your Gravestone. Most People Won't Have Any More Details on Your Life than What's Contained in that Dash.

#### After Your Funeral Service, Most People Will Go back to Their Self-important Thoughts, and Thoughts of You Will Arise less and less Often until You Are Finally Forgotten.

#### A Hundred Years after Your Death, Everyone Who Knew You Will also Be Dead (not that They Spent much time Remembering You anyway), and Nobody Will Visit Your Gravestone. Even Your Gravestone Will Finally Be Forgotten or Destroyed.

#### All Evidence of Your Existence Will Be Gone.

#### As Styx Pointed out in Nothing Ever Goes as Planned: "even Pharaohs Turn to Sand, like a Drop in the ocean". Given These Facts, why Would You Waste Your time Building Castles in the Sand? Given These Facts, why Would You Attach Yourself to Anything? If You Don't Attach Yourself to Life and Worry about Everything, Life Becomes a Grand Adventure Full of Fun and Excitement. When Items You Desire come to You, You Enjoy Them with Thanks, and then You Let Them Go.

### Recognize the Impermanence of All Things

#### When You Recognize Nothing Last Forever

##### You Aren't as Inclined to Attached Yourself to it because You Know You Won't Be Keeping it Forever

##### This Doesn't just Apply to Objects, but also to People and Life Circumstances

#### When You Have Something Pleasant and Impermanent,

##### The Natural Reaction is to Feel Thankful for what You Have

###### Thankfulness is the opposite of Entitlement

##### You Cherish Objects, People, Circumstances while They Last More than before because You Know You Won't Have Them Later

##### Impermanence Doesn't Make You Hold Tighter; Impermanence Helps You Let Go

## Attachment and Your Special Needs Child

### I Am Attached to My Special Needs Child

#### It's Hard to Write a Book like This without Coming across as Someone Who Believes They Have it All Figured out

##### I Don't

#### I Am Still Attached to My Family and My Special Needs Child

#### My Aunt and Uncle Lost Their Son Tragically Several Years ago

##### Every Day I Think about My Cousin

##### His Death Reminds Me about the Preciousness of Each Day with My Son

##### My Compassion for Their Pain Shows Me the Depth of My Own Attachment to My Son

#### Special Needs Children Are Helpless

##### Which Makes Them Dependent

##### Brings out the Caretaking Instincts

##### Makes Them even More Lovable, in My Opinion

#### My Relationship with My Son is the Most Important Feature of My Life

#### My Son, and My Attachment to Him, is Something I Work on

##### I Can Write about the Need to Reduce My Attachments

##### I Find Recognition of Impermanence Helpful as I Appreciate My time with My Son More

##### But I Can't Honestly Say It's Reduced My Attachment to Him much

###### If He Were no Longer a part of My Life, the Sadness Would Be Difficult to Bear

###### I Watched My Aunt and Uncle Endure the Loss of Their Son, and it Was Heartbreakingly Difficult

### What Happens to Your Special Needs Child after You Die?

#### Every Parent Worries about what Will Happen to Their Children when They Die

#### Parents of Special Needs Children Have Added Worries

##### Who Will Take Care of Your Child?

##### Who Will Love Them?

##### Will They Be Exploited or Abused?

##### Unfortunately These Fears Are Made Worse by News Stories where These Fears come True

#### There Are Social Safety Nets in place

##### Social Services Will Always Feel Inadequate

###### Everyone Wants the Best

###### Social Services Are Chronically Underfunded

###### High-tax States Have Better Programs

###### But They Do Exist

##### Someone Will Be Responsible for Your Child's Care

###### Government Social Workers

###### Friends, Family, Community

###### Developing and Maintaining Strong Social Ties in Your Community Will Help with Your Peace of Mind

#### Asset Planning and Special Needs Trusts

##### If You Are Fortunate Enough to Leave behind Assets, You Can Take Extra Precautions to Ensure Your Child's Care

##### Special Needs Trusts Designate Three Important Parties

###### Basically, You Pay to Set up the Support System to provide More than State Social Services provide on Their Own

###### The Attorney's that Administer the Trust and Settle Disputes

###### The Financial Trustees Appointed by You or Your Attorney to Manage the Money

###### The Advocates Who Know Your Child (adult) and Advise the Trustees on how to Spend the Money to Benefit Your Child

###### These Advocates Can Be Family, Friends, or Charities that Do This Work

###### If Your Special Needs Child Has Siblings, and if They Maintain close Ties, that Person is Natural Support

###### I Had a Co-worker for Two Years whose Older Brother Was Autistic

###### I Had Many Conversations with Her on what that Meant to Her and how She Felt about that Familial Responsibility

###### For Her it Was an Unquestioned Duty that She Took on with Love and Compassion

###### Perhaps She Was Exceptional, but I Suspect Her Outlook is More the Rule than the exception

###### Unfortunately for My Son, He is an only Child

##### Having a Special Needs Trust in place is Insurance for Peace of Mind

## Non-judgement and Your Special Needs Child

### Did You Immediately Judge Your Child's Condition Negatively?

#### When You Realized Your Child Was Special

##### Did You Assume Your Life Was Permanently Changed for the Worse?

#### I Did

#### Did You Assume Your Child Would Be a Lifelong Burden on You?

#### In Your Self-centered Musings, Did You Ever Stop to Think about how Being Special Impacted Your Child?

#### I Was Guilty of All the above Terrible Thoughts

##### Your not Bad for Your Thoughts and Reactions

##### Just Don't Get Stuck there

#### Since You Concluded Having a Special Needs Child Was Negative

##### Have You Questioned that Judgement?

##### Are You Completely Certain that It's Bad?

### Do You Condemn Your Child due to Their Condition?

#### This is Surprisingly Common

#### The Belief is Rooted in the Notion that the Child Will Change to Avoid Your Condemnation

##### It Fails with Typical Children Too

##### But's It's Particularly Counter-productive with a Special Needs Child

###### They Didn't Choose Their Condition

###### And They Can't Correct it

### Negative Judgements Make You and Your Special Needs Child Unhappy

#### You Won't Cherish Your Child if You view Them Negatively

#### You Will Resist Your Child Being Who They Are

#### You Will Subject Your Child to Futile Treatments to Try to Make Them Something They Are not

### Abandoning Your Negative Judgments about Your Child and Their Condition is the First step in Curing Your Disfunction

#### Your Child Has Special Needs, Something You Deal with

#### Your Child is Fine; You Are the One with a Problem

## I Can See Clearly now

### Quote

#### I Can See Clearly now

# Johhny Nash

## I Can See Clearly now the Rain is Gone

## I Can See All Obstacles in My way

## Gone Are the Dark Clouds that Had Me Blind

## It's Gonna Be a Bright (bright)

## Bright (bright) Sunshiny Day

## It's Gonna Be a Bright (bright)

## Bright (bright) Sunshiny Day

## Oh, Yes I Can Make it now the Pain is Gone

## All of the Bad Feelings Have Disappeared

## Here is that Rainbow Iâ€™ve Been Praying for

## It's Gonna Be a Bright (bright)

## Bright (bright) Sunshiny Day

## Realizing there Was a Special Opportunity

### I Knew I Needed to Change the way I Viewed My Son, but I Didn't Know how to Do that

### I Needed Someone or Something to Show Me the way

### The Clouds in My Mind Were Beginning to Dissipate

#### I Knew I Could not Go back

##### There is no Acceptance with Negative Judgment and Resistance

##### The Task Was not to Accept My Child Was Broken

#### I Didn't Know what I Would Find Going forward

##### But I Knew there Was Something More

##### I Had Hope Again that I Could Find Happiness, Joy, and Peace of Mind

## Definition of Acceptance

### In My Spiritual quest for Answers, I Came upon a Definition of Acceptance that Jarred Me

#### Wholeheartedly Accepting Things as They Are with no Desire for Things to Be Any Different

#### I Couldn't Wrap My Mind around that

##### That Couldn't Possibly Be Right

##### I Thought Acceptance Was Finding a way to Deal with what Was Bad

##### I Couldn't Pretend Something Was Good when it Was Actually Bad

##### And I Couldn't See what Was Bad as Being Anything other than Bad

##### It Was a Dilemma I Saw no Solution to

#### Wouldn't I Always Have a Burning Desire for My Son to Have a "normal" Life?

#### How Could I want for Him to Be Autistic?

### My Resistance to This Definition Came at Me from Every Angle

#### Which Was a Strong Indication I Was Probably on to Something

#### Whenever I Have such a Strong Emotional Reaction, I Always Stop to Consider why

##### Was it because the Definition Was Wrong?

###### If it Was Wrong, why Was I Having such a Strong Reaction?

##### Or Was it because the Definition Was Right and I just Didn't want to Believe It?

###### Denial May Be Responsible for My Agitation

## Emotive Meditation

### Answers Are only as Good as the Questions Posed

#### Understanding and Processing This Definition Would Require Me to Question My Basic Assumptions and Ask Better Questions

#### Intellectual Understanding Preceded Emotional Understanding by Years

##### Knowing in Your Mind is not the Same as Knowing in Your Heart

##### There is a Form of Meditation Focused on Thoughts and Feelings that I Worked with to Help Bridge This Gap

###### Buddhism, Object Meditation

###### Christianity, Contemplative Meditation

###### New Age, Mindfulness Meditation, Kind of

###### It's the Process of Thinking about Concepts and Working to Sustain and Build the Feelings that Arise

### It's More than just Watching Your Mind

#### It Isn't just Thinking about Things

##### Emotive Meditation is Extremely Focused

##### The Practice Engages Thought

##### But You Don't Follow Trains of Thought

##### You Aren't Trying to Empty the Mind and Purge Thought

##### You Focus on Specific Thoughts and Concepts

##### Although You Can Follow Currents of Feelings

#### A Technique for Mental and Emotional Purification

##### The Mind Can Be Purified to Eliminate Suffering

##### Changing the Emotional Weights Assigned to Thoughts

#### More Demanding than Mindfulness Mediation

##### Mindfulness Doesn't Attempt to Direct Thought or Feeling

##### Mindfulness Meditation is like a Pre-practice Warm up

##### Mindfulness Strengthens the Capacity for Observation and Focus

### How Emotive Mediation Works

#### Thoughts and Feelings

##### Each Thought Carries Emotional Content

###### Pleasant, Unpleasant, Neutral

###### Weak or Intense

##### The Emotional Content Generates Identifiable Feelings

#### Emotive Mediation Starts with Thought or a Concept to Contemplate

##### Often These Ideas Are Associated with why You want to Do Something, or not Do Something

##### They Contain the "whys" and Benefits of Certain Practices

#### When the Thought Generates a Feeling, the Meditation is to Hold that Feeling as long as Possible

##### If the Feeling is Lost, You return to the Contemplation to Regenerate the Feeling

##### This Can Be Done, Over, and Over, and over Again

#### With Practice, You Can Hold the Feeling and Explore It's Flavors and Variations

##### Flow with Currents of Feelings

##### When Contemplating Reasons for Practices, You Can Remember times when the Reason Proved True

##### Compassion is a Feeling that Mixes Joy and Sadness

##### Feelings of Compassion Differ Based on the Circumstances, providing Flavor

#### Emotive Meditation is like Being Marinated

##### The Feelings Seep into other Thoughts

##### For Example, the Thought "special Needs Children Are Helpless and Endure much Unnecessary suffering" Generates Compassion

###### If It's a Fleeting Thought, it Doesn't Carry much Weight, and It's Unlikely to Change Behavior

###### However, if You Spend a Lot of time Thinking about that Fact and Imagine what Their Lives Are Like, it Will Increase Your Motivation to Do Something to Make Circumstances Better

###### At Least it Did for Me, or This Book Wouldn't Have Been Written

## Resistance to the New Definition of Acceptance

### Shouldn't the Definition of Acceptance provide an Opportunity for Dealing with Things You Don't want or Desire?

#### Accepting what You Think is Good is Easy, but it Wouldn't Be Called Acceptance if it Wasn't Hard to Accept what You Think is Bad, Right?

#### Isn't the "bad" Implicit within the Definition?

#### Answer

##### Acceptance is Embracing Something Completely with no Resistance

##### You Aren't Trying to Digest What's Bad

##### You Are Challenged to Recognize it Wasn't Bad to Begin with

###### Your Judgment Was Premature at Best and Incorrect at Worst

###### Acceptance is a Call to Suspend Judgment

###### And Recognize that if You Suspend Judgment, there is no "bad" for You to Accept

### How Do I Accept Injustice and other Events that Are Objectively Bad?

#### Not Everything Can Be Rationalized away as not Bad.

##### Death of a Child

##### Random Violence

##### The Fruits of Evil

##### Ethnic Cleansing

##### Suffering of Special Needs Children

#### Answer

##### Good or Bad is a point of view

##### Even Universal Agreement on the Judgment Doesn't Make the Negative Judgment Desirable

###### The Judgment Itself is the Problem

###### Strong Opinions provide Profound Unhappiness

###### I Believe All the Items I Listed Are Undesirable, Bad if You Prefer

###### Acceptance Isn't about Right or Wrong, Good or Evil

###### A Meteor Destroying the Earth Would Be Undesirable, but it Could Be Accepted

##### Suspending Judgment is a Personal Spiritual Practice

###### Even if the Entire World Agrees with Your Negative Judgement, the Judgment Itself is Still Upsetting

###### The Intent Isn't to Be Aligned with the Collective Judgment of Others or the Imagined Judgment of God

###### This is why so Many Religious People Are not Happy

###### Many of Them Believe Their Opinions Are Absolutely Right and Backed by the Righteousness of God

###### Those that Behave This way lack the Basic Wisdom and Humility to See that They Are not God, and They Can't Judge with the Certainty of God

###### When Reality Intervenes, when "what is" Conflicts with Their God-inspired Truth, They either Retreat into Denial or Become Deeply Despondent

###### In Many Cultures People Hide Their Special Needs Children out of Fear of Judgment

###### The Special Needs Child is Perceived as a Punishment from God for Some Sin

###### The Intent is to Prevent the Negative Internal States Associated with Negative Judgment

###### If the Judgment is not Made, the Negative Feelings Associated with that Judgment Do not Arise

### Perhaps the terms Are not Clearly Defined? What Exactly is Desire?

#### As I Rolled These Questions around in My Mind over Many Months, I Came to Realize the Word Desire Needs a Careful Definition

#### You Can Parse the Difference between want and Desire

##### The Difference is not Academic or Legalistic

##### The Difference Reveals the Core of Spiritual Practice and a Method for Overcoming Attachment

##### Desire is the Emotional Measure of Aversion, Pain, and Anger Obtained when the Desire is Thwarted.

##### Wanting is the Emotional Measure of the Joy, Pleasure, and Satisfaction Obtained from Fruition of the want

##### Desire is Bad or Unskillful, and wanting is Necessary, Good, and Skillful

##### Wanting and Desire Are Completely Different and Separate Measures of Emotion, though Most People Incorrectly See Them as Inseparable, either the Same Thing or Different Sides of the Same Coin.

#### Example of Big wanting with Little Desire

##### I want to Win the Lottery

###### I Would Feel much Joy, Pleasure, and Satisfaction from Winning

##### I Have Little or no Desire to Win the Lottery

###### If it Doesn't Happen, I Am not Upset by it

###### My Expectation of Winning the Lottery is Low

###### My Life Will Be Good whether I Win or Lose

#### Example of Little wanting and Big Desire

##### I Don't want an Asteroid to Hit the Earth

###### I Don't Derive much Satisfaction from Knowing Each Day that an Asteroid Didn't Hit the Earth

###### I Had Low Expectation of the Event.

###### It's More Difficult to Be Thankful or Derive much Satisfaction for what Doesn't Occur

##### I Have a Big Desire for the Asteroid to Miss the Earth

###### The Death of Billions of People Would Be the Cause of much Pain and Suffering and in order to Get over It, the Digestion of a Lot of Sadness

###### Though I Can Accept the Loss and Endure the Sadness, I Don't want To.

###### Nobody Wants to Increase the Amount of Sadness They Must Endure

###### Even if Meditating on Compassion is part of Your Spiritual Practice

###### You Don't Set out to Create Sadness

#### How to want without Desire

##### One of the Most Perplexing Challenges in Spiritual Practice

###### It's a Viable Solution to Overcome Attachment

###### I Haven't Achieved it

###### But I Recognize it is the Goal

###### Provides Me Clarity on what I want to Accomplish

##### Many People Falsely Believe that in order to Eliminate Your Attachments, You Must Stop wanting for Things.

###### People Who Attempt This Become Strangely Detached from Everything

###### You Can't Feel Compassion if You Don't want People to Be Happy and Free from Suffering

###### I want to Help Special Needs Children and Parents

###### If My Book Doesn't Help Them, I Will Be Sad that I Missed an Opportunity, but it Will not Become a Source of Pain and Suffering for Me as I Will Accept the Sadness

###### If I Had not Wanted to Write This Book for Fear of Attachment, You Wouldn't Be Reading it Now, and Any Positive Impact it May Have Would Have Been Lost

###### You Can't Achieve a High Level of Spiritual Liberation if You Don't want it

###### Trying to Stop wanting is a Spiritual Ditch, a Dead End in Failure

###### Wanting without Desire is a Practiced Skill

##### The Key to Reducing and Eliminating Attachments is to Reduce the Importance of Satisfying Those Wants

###### In the Lottery Example, You Could See how wanting Can Be Large but the Importance of Obtaining Can Be Essentially Zero

###### When Obtaining Objects of wanting is Reduced to an Importance of Zero

###### You Obtain All the Upside of Joy, Happiness and Satisfaction when You Get want You want

###### And You Avoid All the Pain and Suffering when You Don't Get what You want

###### You Enjoy Objects of Desire when They come to You and Release Them when They Don't

##### So what is the Key to Reducing the Importance of Obtaining Objects of Desire to Zero?

###### Meditation on or Contemplation of the Impermanence of All Things

###### Practice of Gratitude and Thankfulness

###### More on that Later

### If I Accepted My Son's Condition as Good, Wouldn't I Stop Trying to Help Him?

#### I want My Son to Continue to Grow and Improve to Overcome His Limitations

##### It that Doesn't Happen, I Will Be Sad, but I Will Accept it

##### I want for Him to Improve, but as Iâ€™ve Defined It, I Don't Desire It.

#### Wouldn't My Acceptance Reduce My Motivation to Help Him?

#### Answer

##### Acceptance is not Resignation

##### I Can Strive to Help My Son Gain More Independence while Still Accepting His Current Level

##### Acceptance is about Embracing what is

##### Resistance is a Strong Motivator but a Spiritually Draining One

### How Could I want My Son to Be Autistic?

#### How Could I want My Son to Be Dependent on Others His Whole Life?

#### How Could I want My Son to Be Isolated by His lack of Social Skills?

##### No Friends, no Wife, no Children

##### No Relationships outside His Family

##### How Could I want that for Him?

#### Answer

##### Acceptance is not about wanting for what Are Perceived as Negative Circumstances

##### 180 Degrees from Wrong is also Wrong

##### I Can Accept Those Circumstances for what They Are without the Negative Judgment

### I Wrested with These Distinctions, Tried to Put Them in Practice, and Evaluated the Results

#### I Still Do This Today

#### Spiritual Practice Evolves and Improves through Experience

##### It Isn't a "once and done" Kind of Thing

##### You Never Achieve Spiritual Perfection

##### If You Were "enlightened" it Wouldn't Mean that You Stop Being Mentally Disciplined

###### It Would Mean You Found the Practices that Sustain Your Peaceful Mental and Emotional States

## I Won't Be Fooled Again

### Quote

#### The Who - Won't Get Fooled Again

##### We'll Be Fighting in the Streets

##### With Our Children at Our Feet

##### And the Morals that They Worship Will Be Gone

##### And the Men Who Spurred Us on

##### Sit in Judgement of All Wrong

##### They Decide and the Shotgun Sings the Song

##### I'll Tip My Hat to the New Constitution

##### Take a Bow for the New Revolution

##### Smile and Grin at the Change All around

##### Pick up My Guitar and Play

##### Just like Yesterday

##### Then Iâ€™ll Get on My Knees and Pray

##### We Don't Get Fooled Again

### Benefits of Non-judgment

#### Our Judgments of Good and Bad, Desirable and Undesirable Are the Cause of Many of Our Sufferings

#### Our Comparisons and Judgments Are Causes of Jealousy

#### Out Positive Judgements Lead to Attachment and Loss

#### Our Negative Judgments Are Deeply Disturbing to Peace of Mind of Their Own Accord

#### Even if Your Judgements Were Completely Accurate, the Judgments Themselves Are Causes of Emotional Disturbance

#### My Negative Judgment about My Son's Autism Upset Me for Many Years

### How to Suspend Judgment

#### The Simple Truth about Judgment is that We Are Often Mistaken

##### We Don't Have All the Facts

##### We Don't Know People's Motivations

##### We Don't Know the Larger Context

##### We Imagine We Know All of Those Things, but We Don't

#### The following Stories Are for Emotive Meditation

#### Read Them Multiple times and Meditate on the Meaning

#### Allow it to Link to other Ideas and Experiences

#### Deepen the Personal Truth in it

### True Story of a Man Who is Directly Responsible for 345 Premeditated Murders

#### Suppose I Told You that a Single Person Shot and Killed over 300 People

##### Would You Judge that He is Bad?

#### This Person Was a Sniper in World War Ii Serving His Country

##### Would You Judge that He is Good?

#### This Man, MatthÃ¤us Hetzenauer, Was German, the Losing Side Responsible for the Holocaust

##### Would You Judge that He is Bad?

#### What if He Was not Aware of the Holocaust (many Germans weren't)?

##### Would You Judge that He is Good?

#### What if He Enjoyed Personal Satisfaction for Being a Great Killer?

##### Would You Say that He is Bad?

#### What if He Was American or whatever Your Nationality is and He Fought for Your Cause?

##### Would You Judge that He is Good?

#### Who is to Say Which People Are Good or Bad?

##### We Rarely Have All the Facts, and We Seldom Know what Motivated People to Do what They Did

###### And even if You Had All the Facts, Are You Really Comfortable Pronouncing Righteous Judgment on Others Weighing out All the Extenuating Circumstances?

##### Given These Facts, or lack Thereof, how Can You Be Certain about Your Judgements of Good or Bad in other People?

##### It is Wiser to Suspend Your Judgment about People or Events due to Incomplete Information

##### Once You Internalize the Problems with Making Judgments about People, You Will Make Them less Often

##### When You Do Make Judgments, You Will counter Them with the Recognition that You Could Be Mistaken, Reducing Your Certainty

### Zen Story of the Farmer

#### Contemplating the Lessons of This Story Changed My Outlook

##### It Eliminated the Certainty My Judgments about the Goodness or Badness of Events and Outcomes

##### It Greatly Reduces the Ups and Downs Associated with Life's Dramas

##### It Eliminated My Resistance to Undesirable Outcomes and Fear of Same

#### Blessing or a Curse?

##### Once upon the time there Was an Old Farmer Who Had Worked His Crops for Many Years. One Day His Horse Ran Away. Upon Hearing the News, His Neighbors Came to Visit. "such Bad luck," They Said Sympathetically.

##### "maybe," The Farmer Replied.

##### The next Morning the Horse Returned, Bringing with it Three other Wild Horses. "how wonderful," the Neighbors Exclaimed.

##### "maybe," Replied the Old Man.

##### The following Day, His Son Tried to Ride One of the Untamed Horses, Was Thrown, and Broke His Leg. The Neighbors Again Came to Offer Their Sympathy on His Misfortune.

##### "maybe," Answered the Farmer.

##### The Day After, Military Officials Came to the Village to Draft Young Men into the Army. Seeing that the Son's Leg Was Broken, They Passed Him By. The Neighbors Congratulated the Farmer on how well Things Had Turned Out.

##### "maybe," Said the Farmer.

##### Explanation: the Farmer Understands the True Nature of Life, that You Can't Judge Any Event as an "end" in a Way. There Aren't Definite Breaks that Separate One Moment versus Another, and there Isn't a Perfectly Formulated End Which Everything Builds To.

##### There's Always Tomorrow. And whether the Day Was Good or Bad, There's a Million Effects Which Can Arise from One Event. Good and Bad Are Interconnected. They Are, in Fact, Two Sides of the Same Coin. If Things Seem Perfect, They Aren't. Things Can Change in an Instant, at All Times. And They Will at Some point or Another.

#### The Story of the Farmer and the Horse Doesn't Go far Enough

##### It Isn't only about Initial Judgments to External Events

##### Our Internal Decisions Based on Those Judgments Often Lead to Poor Outcomes

##### The Initial Judgment is like Planting a Seed in Your Mind

##### The subsequent Decisions and Behaviors Nurture and Grow that Seed into a Vigorous Weed

### The Curse of Winning the Lottery

#### If You Were to Win the Lottery, You Would Immediately Judge that as Something Good

##### You Would Imagine All the Things You Would Buy with Your New Fortune

##### You Would Imagine the Release from Stresses of Financial Limitation

##### You Would Feel Euphoric

##### Your Belief about the Goodness of This Event Would Be Unshakable

#### People Who've Won the Lottery Often Find there is Bad that Comes with the Good

##### Family and Friends Start Asking for Money

###### If They Say No, They Lose Family and Friends

###### If They Say Yes, then Encourage Dependency and Grow to Resent the People Asking

##### Their Finances Suddenly Become much More Complicated

###### They Need to Spend Money on People to Manage Their Money and Taxes

##### They Fear Losing Their Money

###### Rather than Find Peace of Mind, They Start to Worry about not Having Money

###### They Suspect People Are out to Exploit Their Generosity and Steal from Them

###### They Become Miserly and Practice Generosity less Often

#### The Story of the Lottery Winner

##### A Single Woman Won the California Lottery in the Early 1980s.

##### She Worked for a Local Charity because She Enjoyed a Life of Service to Others

##### She Struggled Financially because She Lived in an Expensive Area with a Low Paying Job

##### When She Won the Lottery, All Her Financial Worries Went away

###### She Moved out of Her Small Apartment into a Large Luxury home

###### She Took Her Payout over 20 Years of even Payments

###### The Payments Were Several times what She Made from Her Job

##### At This point the Externalities Were Absorbed, but the Internal Changes Started to Surface

###### She Could Have Kept Working a Job She Loved in Service of Others

###### She Could Have Donated even More to Charities Doing Good Work

###### She Could Have Devoted Her time and Resources to Any Number of Good and Emotionally Enriching Causes

###### She Did None of that

##### She Took a Sabbatical from Work to Rearrange Her Life

###### The Charity She Worked for Was Accommodating

###### She Purchased Her New home and Settled in

###### She Particularly Enjoyed Sunning Herself at Her New Pool and Entertaining Friends

###### She Shared Her Excitement with Her Friends about Returning to Work and Doing Good Things with Her Newfound Good Fortune

##### She Came to Enjoy Her Life of Luxury

###### One Day, Sitting at the Pool by Herself She Asked Herself if She Really Wanted to Go back to Work

###### The Commute from the New House Would Be much Longer

###### Some of the Paperwork Was Drudgery and Took time out of Helping People

###### She Noticed that Some of Her Coworkers Seemed to Be Jealous of Her New Circumstances

###### She Found the Resistance to Going back Stronger than Her Desire to Go back to Her Old Job

###### She Thought that Enjoying Her Relaxing Freedom to Work on Her Tan Was Enticing

###### She Surrendered a Career of Working for the Benefit of Others for a Lifestyle of Benefiting Herself

###### In the Process, She Set Conditions in Motion to Make even Worse Decisions and Become a Contemptible Person

##### She Started to Complain about the Cost of Hired Help

###### Since She wasnâ€™t' Working Anymore, She Didn't Have that Income to Supplement Her Spending

###### Her New House Was Luxurious but Expensive to Maintain

###### The Maid Who Cooked Her Food, Did Her Laundry, and Cleaned Her House Cost a Lot of Money

###### The Gardeners Who Mowed Her Lawn, Planted Her Flowers and Maintained the grounds Cost a Lot of Money

###### The Pool Maintenance Man that Made Sure the Water She Swam in and Sunned by Was Clean also Cost Her a Lot of Money

###### She Realized that Paying All This Staff Prevented Her from Traveling More

###### Rather than Feeling Gratitude for All These People Did to Make Her Comfortable, She Resented that She Had to Pay Them so much

###### She Was Becoming More Self-important and less Charitable toward Others

##### As the Years Went by She Became Lazier, More Self-indulgent, and She Stopped Giving to Charities All together because She Needed to Cover the Cost of Her Own Lifestyle

##### After about 15 Years, She Started to Worry about what Would Happen when the Lottery Payments Stopped

###### She Didn't Do Anything about This Worry

###### She Didn't Go back to School or Seek a Job

###### The Worry Got Stronger and More Debilitating, but She Did Nothing to Remedy it

##### When the Payments Stopped in Year 20, She Sought other Sources of Money She Could Spend

###### Her Luxury home in California Had Greatly Appreciated in Value

###### She Still Had a Small Mortgage that She Had Paid down over 20 Years, but She Had Millions in home Equity

###### Since Lenders at the time Were providing home Equity Loans up to 100% of the Value of the Home, She Took the Money

###### She Borrowed against Her House in a Ponzi Scheme until the Crash of 2008 Wiped out the Value of Her home

###### She Was Accustomed to Living in a Luxury Mansion

###### She Gained no Skills that Would Help Her Earn a Living

###### She Became Increasing Self-involved and Indulgent

###### She Stopped Caring for or Working for the Benefit of Others

###### She Was a Contemptible Human Being with Few Friends

###### When She Lost Everything, Which She Did, She Was Emotionally Devastated

##### Her Initial Judgment Was that Winning the Lottery Was a Good Thing

###### She Reinforced This Judgment with 25 Years of Self-indulgence

###### In the End, it All Came Crashing down

###### Not due to Some Unforeseen outside Force

###### But due to the Results of Her Own Poor Decisions

##### Do You Think Winning the Lottery Was Good for Her?

### The Primordial Error

#### Your Reaction to Your Child's Diagnosis Was Mistaken

##### In the Opening of This Book I Asked You to Suspend Your Disbelief and Open Yourself to the Idea that Your Special Needs Child Was not a Curse

##### Everything You've Read up to This point Has Been Opening the Door of Your Mind to This Idea

##### When You Came to Realize and Accept that You Had a Special Needs Child, You Judged that Negatively.

###### It Was a Problem that Needed Fixing

###### It Was an Unacceptable Outcome for You and Your Child

###### This Was a Cloud with no Silver Lining

###### It Was All Bad, and You Were Being Forced to Live with it

##### That Judgment Was Wrong

#### That Negative Judgment Was the Seed You Planted in Your Mind Many Years ago

##### You've Been Nurturing that Idea for Years

###### Every Experience You've Had with Your Child and Others Has Been Filtered through that Negative Judgment

###### Your Interpretations of Events Has Served to Reinforce Your Initial Judgment

##### That Seed Has Grown into a Deeply Rooted Tree with Thick Branches and Poisonous Fruit

###### It's so Deeply Rooted that It's Become part of Your Identity

###### You Believe the Poisonous Fruit is Something You Must Eat to Survive

##### It's All a Mistake

##### You Must Cut that Tree Down, Reject Its Fruit, Dig out Its Roots, and Destroy Its Seeds

###### It's no Easy Task

###### But It's Essential

## He Ain't Heavy

### Quote

#### He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother

# The Hollies

## If Iâ€™m Laden at All

## I'm Laden with Sadness

## That Everyone's Heart

## Isn't Filled with the Gladness

## Of Love for One Another

## It's a Long, long Road

## From Which there is no return

## While We're on the way to there

## Why not Share

## And the Load

## Doesn't Weigh Me down at All

## He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother

## Gratitude and Thankfulness Practice

### At the time of This Writing, My Primary Spiritual Practice is to Focus My Thoughts on Feelings of Thankfulness for My Blessings and Enjoyments

#### Specific Practice, Intentionally Chosen

#### I Find it Helpful to Have a Primary Practice to Combat My Most Difficult Emotional Habits

##### I Find Gratitude Training Helpful as I Am Prone to Dismiss Joy and instead Focus on lack

###### A Common Bad Habit among All People

###### The Mind Will Naturally Focus on what it Doesn't Have and Believes it Wants if Left Untrained and Undisciplined

##### If I Am not Watching My Mind and Engaging in This Practice, My Mood Sours over Time, and I Am Prone to More Disturbances

#### I Still Watch My Mind Constantly and Apply the Opponents Described in This Work when Needed

##### But Applying Opponents is Reactionary and not Necessary at All times

##### For Me, a Primary Practice is Something I Engage in 24/7

###### Eventually it Becomes Habituated and no Longer Requires Intense Focus and Mental Discipline

###### I Went through that Cycle with the Practice of Exchanging Myself with My Special Needs Son

###### After Engaging in the Practice Consciously for Many Months,

###### I no Longer Needed to Remind Myself of Its Importance

###### I just Did it All the time

### What is Gratitude Training?

#### Https://www.templeton.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jtf-hope-optimism.pdf

#### Be Thankful for whatever I Have

##### Even in the Worst of Circumstances, I Can Find Ways to Interpret the Events as Good

###### I Cried because I Have no Shoes until I Saw a Man with no Feet

###### It Doesn't Negate or Deny the Negative or Undesirable Qualities of whatever Happened

###### It Merely Focuses Attention and thereby the Emotion on Something Positive and Uplifting

###### Thoughts Determine Feelings, and Feelings Control Moods

##### Finding the Positive, no Matter how Small, is a Mental Discipline

###### When I Engage in the Practice, My Mood Improves, and I Am Happier

###### Always and Every time

###### Sometimes My Mind Resists, Claims I Have More Important Things to Be Concerned with or Worry about

###### But That's why It's a Mental Discipline, Something You Do even if You Don't want to

###### It Isn't just Positive Thinking

###### You Can Lose Yourself in Delusion and Fantasy

###### If I Imagine My Son Will Be Completely Cured and Life a "normal" Life, that Would Be a Pleasant Delusion

###### It's an Interpretation of Reality, Based on Fact

###### My Son Will Always Be Autistic, and there is much Good in that for Him and Our Family

#### Cultivate an Optimistic Disposition

##### I Intentionally Cultivate the Belief that Events Will Turn out in Ways the Promote My Happiness and well Being

###### Glass Half Full

###### Since This is an Interpretation of Events, not an Objective Evaluation, It's Possible to Achieve

###### Even if Things Occur that I Don't want to Occur, I Have Learned to Suspend Judgment and Look for What's Positive

###### It's Always there if You Look for it

###### This Entire Work is about Convincing You that Your Special Needs Child is a Blessing and not a Curse

##### Optimism is Natural, Pessimism is Learned

###### I Believe People Are Naturally Optimistic

###### However, since People also Naturally Focus on lack and Negative Outcomes, Their Natural Optimism is Subdued

###### I Used to Believe that I Was Naturally Pessimistic, but I Came to Realize My Pessimism Was Entirely due to My Habits of Thought

###### Optimism is Overridden by Frequent Negative Interpretations of Events

###### Overtime Optimism Fades and Pessimism Takes over

###### Some Mistakenly Call This Wisdom that Comes from Experience

###### It's not Wisdom

###### It's Ignorance Born of Undisciplined Negative Interpretations

### Gratitude Overcomes Dissatisfaction

#### Gratitude is also an Emotional Opponent

##### Am Emotional Opponent is a Mental Discipline I Engage in whenever Some Event Disturbs My Peace of Mind

##### Gratitude Training is Generally Different because It's not Intended to Overcome Some Specific Disturbing Occurrence

##### But if Some Event Disturbs Me Deeply, I Will Suspend My Judgment until I Can Find Some Good in it to Serve as an Opponent Emotional Force

#### I Practice Gratitude as a Primary to Overcome the Unsatisfactoriness of Daily Life

##### The Buddha's Teaching Are Often Described as Overcoming Suffering

###### However, that Isn't Completely Accurate

###### Overcoming Overt Suffering and Pain is part of the Buddha's Teaching, but what He Was Describing Was More Subtle and Nuanced than that

##### The Buddha Noticed that Life Experience Becomes Imbued with a Permanent Sense of Dissatisfaction

###### It Isn't Necessarily Overtly Painful or Intense Suffering

###### It's a General Mood or Sense that Life Isn't All that Great

###### In Short, Life is Boring and All Experiences Become Unsatisfying, even Intensely Pleasurable Ones

##### The Buddha Realized This Unsatisfactoriness Was Rooted in Our Sense of Self, Our Endless Desire, and Our Endless quest to Find Momentary Satisfaction

###### Ask Any Drug Addict, and They Will Lament the Fact that Pleasure Fades

###### Satisfaction Never Lasts

###### We Are Constantly Driven by Our Dissatisfaction to Find the next Pleasure, the next Resource, the next Momentary Satisfaction that Quickly Fades

##### I Practice Gratitude as an Opponent to the Feelings of Unsatisfactoriness of Daily Life

### The Hamster Wheel of Endless Problem Solving

#### I Address "problems" only on an As-needed Basis

##### I Try Focus on the Present rather than Worry about the Future

###### Eckhart Tolleâ€™s Power of now Addresses This Key Feature of the Mind of Worry

###### As Eckhart Tolle is Fond of Asking "what Problem Do You Have at This moment?"

###### The Answer is Nearly Always "none"

###### I'm only Imagining Future Problems I May Have to Deal with at Some point

###### Committing to Solving Problems only on an "as needed" Basis Eliminates a Lot of Worry

##### It Isn't Desirable or Practical to Eliminate All Thoughts of the Future

###### All Complex Tasks Require Future Thinking and Planning

###### I Need to Plan for Retirement

###### I Need to Exercise for Future Health

###### Setting aside time to Address Future Events is Necessary and Desirable

###### However, I Minimize the time and Effort to Deal with Those Events and Circumstances that Are not Immediate and not what I want

##### I Completely Ignore Negative Judgments when not Immediately Useful for Decision Making

#### It Takes Some Faith to Stop Focusing on All Your Problems All the time

##### People Worry that if They Don't Obsess on Problems, They Won't Solve Them

##### Or They Will Make a Poor Decision because They Haven't Thought Everything through

##### This Hamster Wheel Feeling is Called the Red Queen Effect

###### You Don't Need to Burn Endless Energy on Solving Perceived Problems just to Stay where You Are

###### The Endless Focus on Problems is not Helpful

###### In Fact, it is the Root of All Worry and Anxiety

###### Once You Realize You Are on a Hamster Wheel Expending Effort while Making no Progress, the only Rational Choice is to Get off

###### Contemplate that Fact the next time You Find Yourself Deep in Worry

##### A Certain Amount of Rumination is Necessary

###### But it is Consistently Overdone by a Large Factor

###### This Becomes a Rationalization for Wasted time and Energy

### Engage in Gratitude Practice whenever the Mind is not Needed for Some other Activity

#### What is the Quality of Your Life when You Are Alone with Your Thoughts?

##### I Remember Watching Star Wars and Asking Myself what Darth Vader Thought about when Traveling Alone in His Ship for Hours on a Mission

###### Yoda Would Have Been Happy and at Peace

###### Vadar Would Have Been Angry and Tormented

##### Do You just Let Your Mind Wander Aimlessly?

###### If You Do, Your Mind Will Invariably Turn to Your Problems and Focus on Your Upsets

###### That Will Sour Your Mood

##### When You Are Alone with Your Thoughts, Focus on Gratitude

##### When I Am Alone with My Thoughts, Which is Quite Often Being an Introvert, I Focus on Gratitude

#### In place of Mindless Entertainment, Focus on Gratitude

##### Or at Least Spend a Moment Being Grateful for the Opportunity to Enjoy Mindless Entertainment

##### I Don't Allow Myself much Mindless Entertainment

##### If I Did, I Would Never Have Written This Book

##### But when I Do, I Aware of My Choice, and Iâ€™m Thankful I Have the Opportunity

#### Ask Yourself "what Wonderful New Things Will I Experience today?"

##### Ask Yourself that Question Each time You Leave Your House, and You Will Be Amazed at what You Find

##### Questions like This Set Your Mental Radar to Look for Items to Be Thankful for even when Your Conscious Mind is Engaged in other Activities

##### It's Setting Your Intention on Finding Something New and Wonderful

#### I Found Gratitude Practice a Great Replacement for Extraneous Thoughts about Myself

##### I Used to Focus Exclusively on My Own Life Circumstances and Perceived Problems

###### Losing Sleep over Circumstances

###### Worrying about Potential Outcomes

###### Me, Me, Me

##### I Never Actually Solved Many Problems that Way, but that Didn't Stop Me from Trying

##### Even if My Focus Changed My Life Circumstances for the Better, I Simply Replaced the Old Problem with a New One

###### Problem Solving is a Mental Sickness from Which You Never Are Cured except by Abandoning the Habit

### Gratitude Training Fosters a Peaceful State of Mind and a Happy Mood

#### Whatever You Think about Generates the Feelings that Determine Your Experience of Daily Life

##### If You Think about what Brings You Joy and Happiness, that Becomes Your Experience of Daily Life

##### If You Think about Your Problems and what You Lack, that Becomes Your Experience of Daily Life

#### With Continuing Practice, the Happiness Resulting from a Focus on Gratitude Becomes the Dominant State of Mind

#### Once Happiness Becomes the Norm, that State is Maintained by Applying Opponents when Something Disturbs Your Peace

## Gratitude Training with a Special Needs Child

### Having a Special Needs Child Was an Event that Forced Me to Examine the Tendency of Mind to Focus on the Negative

### At First, All Your Judgments about Having a Special Needs Child Are Negative

#### Finding a Cure Becomes an Obsessive Thought Pattern Full of Negative Judgment, Worry, and Suffering

#### I didnâ€™t want to Focus on Anything Positive because I Believed it Would Have Distracted Me from Finding a Cure or Doing What's Best for My Child

#### These Thoughts Didn't Help Me or My Son, and They Won't Help You or Your Child

#### The Non-stop Negative Judgment toward Your Child is a Big part of the Problem

### Even from the Beginning, You Should Seek Ways to Train in Gratitude

#### If I Had it to Do over Again, I Would Have Kept My Focus on the Positive

##### Even Now, My Remorse over My Mistake Serves as Motivation to Remain Positive

#### Your Child is Alive

#### Your Child Will Love You and Appreciate the Ways You Fulfill Their Special Needs

#### Your Child Will Grow to Experience a Special Environment of Love and Acceptance

##### Because You Will Make that Happen

#### Your Child Will Spur Your Spiritual Growth

##### Compassion

##### Acceptance

##### Patience

#### You Will Be a Happier, More Fulfilled, Better Person because of Your Child

## Just the way You Are

### Quote

#### Billy Joel - just the way You Are

#### I Would not Leave You in times of Trouble

#### We Never Could Have come This Far, Mmm

#### I Took the Good Times, Iâ€™ll Take the Bad times

#### I'll Take You just the way You Are

#### I Said I Love You, That's Forever

#### And This I Promise from the Heart, Mmm

#### I Couldn't Love You Any Better

#### I Love You just the way You Are

### Practice Exchanging Yourself with Your Special Needs Child

#### Exchanging Myself with My Son is both a Practice and a way of Life

##### My Relationship with My Special Needs Son is Based on This Practice

##### My Vacation with My Son

###### When My Son Was 17, He and I Spent 9 Days together apart from His Mother

###### We Traveled out of State and Were Always together without other Family for the Entire Trip

###### I Took the Opportunity to See if I Could Be Completely Devoted to His Pleasures and Needs

###### Being on Vacation and Isolated from Others, I Had no Distractions

###### We Were in a Recreation Area with Many Activities Available to Us, so I Imagined what I Would want to Do if I Were Him, and Practiced that Moment-by-moment, Hour-by-hour for More than a Week

###### I Didn't Allow Myself to even Ask Myself the Question about what I Wanted

###### I Remained 100% Focused on Him, Putting Myself in His Mind, Imagining what I Would want if I Were Him, and Acting on that Impulse

###### My Mind Resisted for the First Few Days, but on about the Fourth Day, it Started to Become Natural

###### I Noticed the Joy I Obtained Vicariously through Him Increased

###### I Noticed the Pleasure He Got from Our Activities Increased

###### By Immersing Myself in the Practice, I Came to Fully Understand and Appreciate the Effect

###### It Was One of the Best Vacations and Most Meaningful Experiences of My Life

##### I Engage in This Practice at All times now

###### Not to the Same Degree of Selflessness, but Still with a Deep Understanding of what it Takes to Put His Interests ahead of My Own

###### Most of Our Daily Activities now Are Things We both Enjoy and We Have a Nice Balance

#### Put Yourself in Your Child's Shoes

##### Exchanging Self with Others is to Think and Act in the Selfish Interest of Another Person

###### Try Practicing it with Your Special Needs Child

###### Ask Yourself What's Important to Your Child without regard to what is Important to You

###### You Have to Apply Your Own Wisdom to What's Right and Wrong and What's Best for Your Child

###### But You Don't Weigh Their Interest against Yours and only Consider what They want in Your Selfish Decision Making

###### You End up Doing Things You Don't Really want to Do because It's what They want to Do and It's What's Best for Them

###### Yet You Don't Feel like It's a Sacrifice

##### Selflessness is not Martyrdom

###### Many People Develop Personalities of People-pleasers

###### There is Certainly Nothing Wrong with a Desire to Please Others

###### But Martyrs Sacrifice Themselves in order to Gain Sympathy from Others

###### Martyrdom in Personal Relationships is a Source of Power and a means to Try to Control Others

###### Martyrdom is Selfishness in Disguise

###### Selflessness is to Give to Another without regard to Personal Gain

###### Even if that Personal Gain is Merely Recognition from Others

###### One of the Many Reasons This Book Was Written Anonymously is to Prevent Any Possibility of Martyrdom or Accusations of Same

##### It's More than just Empathy

###### Empathy is Imagining what Another Feels and Giving Weight to that when Making Decisions

###### You Can Imagine how Someone Feels, Consider it Important, and yet Act Selfishly Anyway

###### People Excel at Finding Justifications for Putting Their Own Selfish Interests over the Wants of other People

###### Many of Our Social Concepts Work to Justify Selfishness

###### Our Entire Economic System Revolves around the Idea the Selfish Actors Can Somehow Produce Good for the Many

###### Hollywood Produces Movies like "wall street" where Characters Expound the Idea that "greed is good"

###### Our Religious Institutions Focus on Personal Salvation First and Foremost

###### Acting in a Selfless regard for Others is Considered Weak and Undesirable

###### Considering Someone's Feelings is not the Same as Acting on Those Feelings as if They Were Your Own

##### Love Your Neighbor as Yourself

###### This is Widely Misinterpreted as an Instruction on Being a Good Person

###### This is Actually an Instruction to exchange Yourself with Others

###### Love Others Exactly as You Would Love Yourself

###### Treasure Their Desires as if They Were Your Own

###### Act in Their Best Interest

###### Act in Their Selfish Interest, within Reason

#### Exchanging Self with Others is the Source of much Joy

##### Taking Pleasure in the Happiness and Accomplishments of Others is Joyful

##### Being Responsible for the Happiness and Pleasure of Others is Gratifying

##### Bringing Others Pleasure and Happiness is a Source of Endless Joy and Satisfaction

##### I Have Found This Practice to Be One of the Greatest Rewards for Raising a Special Needs Child

### Treasuring Your Special Needs Child instead of Yourself

#### These Concepts provide Motivation for Practice

#### Treasuring Others over Yourself Fulfills Your Wishes and Theirs

##### This Practice is Essential to Raising a Special Needs Child as They Can't Take Care of Themselves

##### My Son Can't Take Care of Himself

###### He Doesn't Have Sophisticated or Underhanded Interpersonal Strategies for Obtaining what He Wants from Others

###### He Lies so Rarely, and Does it so Transparently, that My Wife and I Find it a Source of Amusement when He Makes the Attempt

###### He Occasionally Will Try to Conceal Behaviors He Thinks We Don't want Him to Do, like Wasting Toilet Paper, but He's Clumsy and Unsophisticated in His Efforts, and We Always Catch Him

###### He Doesn't Understand Money, so He Can't Bribe People

###### Any Form of Manipulation You Can Think of is beyond His Abilities

###### Without These Foibles, He Can only Obtain what He Wants by Asking for it and Hoping the Answer is Yes

##### Since the only way My Son Can Get what He Wants is by Asking Us for It, or by Us Anticipating His Needs, His Quality of Life Completely Depends on Our Attention and Favorable Treatment

###### This is both a Responsibility and an Opportunity

###### Fulfilling This Responsibility Can either Be a Duty We Dread or an Opportunity for Joy

###### We Chose Joy

###### And in Choosing Joy, We Fulfill Our Wishes for a Happy Life as well as His

#### Treasuring Others Protects the Others and You from Suffering

##### If You Are Focused on Your Own Suffering, then You Are Suffering

##### If Others Are Suffering, You Will Feel Compassion, a Virtuous Feeling

###### Your Compassion for Others Will Motivate You to Relieve Their Suffering Benefiting both of You

##### Prior to Making My Son the Primary Focus of My Life, I Was a Typical Struggling Man Trying to Advance My Career and Status and Make More Money

###### In that Respect, I Was Completely Ordinary following the Same Script as Everyone Else

###### Since I Was Totally Focused on My Career, My Standing, My Income, I Was Constantly Upset by My Perceived Failures, and I Was Generally not Happy because I Was Always Focused on Myself, what I Lacked, and My Problems

###### Some Will Think, I Must Have Been a Loser, so Devoting My Life to My Son Was an Easy Choice

###### Some Will Think, I Must Have Been Successful to Have the means to Stop Worrying about Those Things and Take Working with My Son as My Primary Purpose

###### Whatever You Might Think is More a Reflection of where You Are in Life rather than where I Was when I Made the Change

##### Once I Started Focusing on My Son instead of Myself, My Entire Life Improved

###### I Suddenly Didn't Have Very Many Problems

###### I Still Had Business Affairs to Tend To, Tasks at a Job to Perform, but They Became Merely Items on My to Do List rather than Some Huge Problem that Needed Solving

###### I Didn't Have Troubling Thoughts about Who I Was, Who I Was Supposed to Be, or Who Others Thought I Was

###### When I Stopped Caring about My Identity, at Least 50% of My Thinking Evaporated

###### I Was Astonished by how much I Thought about Myself

###### My Stress Level Declined 80% or More

###### Without the Worries about My Problems and the Concerns over My Status, the Sources of My Stress Evaporated

###### Plus, I Replaced Those Thoughts with My Family, the Things I Am Thankful For, and how I Can Make My Son's Life even Better, so My Mood Was Elevated

##### Not Surprisingly, when I Started Focusing on My Son, His Life Improved Too

###### Whatever You Give Attention to Will Bloom

###### Your Attention is like Water and Fertilize for the Seeds You've Planted in Your Mind

###### If You Attend to Your Weeds, Your Weeds of Disturbance Will Grow Vigorously

###### If You Attend to Your Special Needs Child, Your Child Will Blossom

#### Treasuring Others Brings Joy to Your Life

##### Joy is the Pleasure and Satisfaction You Gain Vicariously through Others

##### Treasuring Their Happiness and Working toward it Brings You Joy

##### This is the Reward for Raising a Special Needs Child

##### If I Didn't Believe This Were True, I Wouldn't Have Bothered to Write This Book

###### I Didn't Write This Book for Money or Fame

###### If the Best I Could Do in My Own Life Was to Find a way to Grin and Bear It, I Wouldn't Have a Message Worth Sending

###### Treasuring My Son Has Made All the Difference in My Life

### Giving and Your Special Needs Child

#### Special Needs Children provide Natural Opportunities for Giving

##### They Are Helpless and Need Assistance

##### They Are Your Family, so You Should Be Naturally Inclined

##### Giving to Your Special Needs Child Should Become Central to Your Daily Life

##### Much of the Motivation to Complete This Work Was an Extension of the Giving I Practice with My Son

###### Giving Love, Attention, Special Experiences, Travel, Entertainment, It's All Good

#### Generosity Can Be Learned and Cultivated

##### My Special Needs Son Understands and Practices Generosity

###### He Will Offer Food and other Items to Us to Please Us

###### We've Cultivated and Rewarded This Behavior over Many Years

###### He Does it Reflexively Now, and He Gains Pleasure in the Giving

###### He Always Surprises Me when He Offers Something I Know He Really Wants

### Love and Your Special Needs Child

#### What is Love?

##### For a Topic that is so Widely Discussed, You Would Think there Was a Universally Accepted Definition

###### There Isn't

##### Is Love a Thing?

##### Is Love a Feeling?

##### Is Love an Action?

##### Dictionary

###### An Intense Feeling of Deep Affection.

###### Most People when They Think about Love, They Define it as a Feeling

###### Further, Most People Confuse Their Feelings of Attachment for Love

###### Many People Believe Love is a Random Feeling, a Passion outside Their Control

###### There is a Kernel of Truth here as the Conditions and Characteristics of People that Create an Initial Spark is Mysterious

###### But the Feeling of Love, the Deep Affection of Others, Can Be Cultivated and Enhanced

###### People Often Make Life Decisions Based on the Intensity of the Feeling of Love

###### Most People Chose Life Partners This way

###### It's a Good Start, but as the High Divorce Rate Proves, it Isn't the Best or Most Important Criteria

###### The Intensity of the Feelings of Love Ebbs and Flows

###### Chivalry Dictates that Love is either Increasing or Decreasing but Never in a Steady State.

###### Any Emotion Will Change in Intensity over Time, Love is not Unique in This regard

###### The Problem is that People Will Make Life Decisions Based on These Changes

###### The Feeling is a Critical part of Love, but It's only a part

###### Love is Supported by Action

##### 1 Corinthians 13:4-5

###### The Bible Has a Wonderful Description of Love Based on the Actions of Love rather than the Feelings Associated

###### Love is Patient, Love is Kind. It Does not Envy, it Does not Boast, it is not Proud. It Does not Dishonor Others, it is not Self-seeking, it is not Easily Angered, it Keeps no Record of Wrongs.

###### Focuses Attention on the Actions Associated with the Feeling

###### Patient, Accepting People as They Are with no Resistance

###### Kind, Expressing Feelings of Warmth, Performing Acts of Service

###### No Envy, Does not Express of Feel Jealousy

###### No Boasting, not Proud, Does not Feel Superiority over Others

###### No Dishonor, not Acting in Ways that Harms Others

###### Not Self-seeking, Puts the Interests of Others over the Self

###### No Anger,

###### No Resentments

##### Tibetan Buddhism

###### When Positive Thoughts Support a Joyous Heart, the outward Manifestation is Acts of Kindness

##### Wikipedia

###### My Favorite Definition of Love Comes from Wikipedia

###### As a Parent of a Special Needs Child, My Duty is to provide Unselfish, Loyal, and Benevolent Concern for My Son

###### This Mind Informs My Feelings Which Motivates My Actions

#### Love is both a Feeling and an Activity

##### The Feeling of Intense Affection

###### Can Be Natural, Familial

###### Can Be Cultivated

###### In Meditation You Can Extend Love from Family to Friends and Others

##### When the Child Doesn't Have the Desire or the Capacity for Competition, there Are no Barriers

##### Any Barriers to Feeling Affectionate Love Are within You

###### Broken or Unworthy?

###### Unruly or Difficult to Manage?

###### Demanding and Needy?

###### Abandon These Thoughts, and Affectionate Love Will Strongly Arise

##### I Practice a Buddhist Meditation Called Wishing Love

###### The Wishing Love Meditation Starts by Bringing a Person into Your Mind that Generates Strong Feelings of Affectionate Love

###### Once You Generate the Feeling, You Bring Others into Your Heart and Try to Sustain the Feelings by Wishing Them Love

###### I Always Start This Meditation by Thinking about My Son

###### He Never Provides Any Resistance or Reasons not to Love Him

###### In a Perfect World, I Would Start with My Wife, but Realistically, Our Petty Arguments and Minor Disturbances Make Her Unsuitable at times

###### My Feelings of Affectionate Love for My Son Are Pure and Untainted

### Manifesting Kindness as a way of Life

#### My Life Has Been Completely Transformed by My Special Needs Son

##### He Has Been the Focus of My Spiritual Practice for Many Years

##### At First, I Had to Form Key Mental Disciplines to Stop from Becoming Depressed

##### Later, I Came to Appreciate the Benefits These Disciplines provided

##### This Encouraged Me to Explore and Experiment with other Disciplines to Solve other Mental and Emotional Problems

##### And through it All, there Was My Son, My Beacon of Hope, My Reason for Putting in All the Work

##### I Was Determined to Make His Life Be as Wonderful, as Meaningful, and as Joyous as it Could Be

##### As My Inner and Outer World Changed, He Blossomed

##### Over Time, I Came to Understand More Deeply what it means to Live a Good Life.

#### Inwardly a Good Life is Characterized by an Uplifting Mood with Continuous Feelings of Joy and Happiness with Limited Disturbances to This Emotional State

##### Achieving This State of Being is the Purpose of All Spiritual Practice

##### It Takes Mental Discipline to Enter This State and to Fend off the Disturbances that Take You out of it

##### But if You Achieve This State of Mind, how Does it Manifest in the World?

#### Outwardly, a Good Life is Characterized by a Kind Disposition, Emotional Stability, and Actions Benefitting Others

##### Training with Gratitude or Thankfulness Elevates Your Mood and Inclines You toward Acts of Kindness

##### The Diminishment of Self-importance and the Practice of Moral Discipline Makes You Worthy of Friendship

##### Humility Makes You Approachable and Likable

##### Refraining from Judgments about People and Events Makes You More Accepting of Others and Reduces Conflicts with Them

##### Remembering Impermanence Reduces Your Attachments and Makes Your Behavior toward Others More Respectful and less Manipulative

##### Practicing Giving Endears You to Others because You Are Focused on Bringing Them Joy and Happiness

##### Practicing Rejoicing Makes other People Happy and Makes Them More Inclined to Share Their Joys with You, Improving the Quality of All Your Relationships

##### Practicing Acceptance Eliminates Anger and Allows Others to Be Happy in Your Presence without Concern that They Must Defend Themselves against Your Anger

##### Practicing Forgiveness Helps People Know that if They Make a Mistake that You Will Still Be Kind toward Them, Making Them More Comfortable in a Relationship with You

##### Practicing Compassion Demonstrates that You Have Empathy and a Genuine Concern for Another's well Being. This Allows Them to Feel Completely Safe in Your Company.

##### Practicing Love Makes People Feel Special and Increases Their Desire to Reciprocate Good Feelings and Kind Actions

##### In Short, Practicing All These Disciplines Makes You a Person other People Strongly want to Be Around. You Exude Positivity, Acceptance, and Love, You Give Generously, and You Act in Ways that Brings Others Joy and Happiness.

###### Who Wouldn't want That?

#### What is Daily Life like when Manifesting Kindness?

##### When You Embrace the Mental Disciplines Described, You no Longer Spend Most of Your time and Energy Focusing on Your Personal Problems.

###### Rather than Experiencing a Lower Quality of Life for lack of Attention to Your Perceived Problems

###### You Experience a Higher Quality of Life because what You Previously Considered a Problem Evaporates

###### You Still Do What's Needed when Needed, but You Do it without Worry

###### Over Time, the Number of Problems You Experience in Daily Life Falls to near Zero

##### In place of Problems, Your Mind Gravitates toward Joyous Things

###### Thankfulness for All You Have and Your Enjoyments

###### Satisfaction in the Joy You Bring Others

###### Ways to Give More to Others to Bring Them Joy and Happiness

###### Thankfulness for the Opportunities You Have to Bring Joy to Others

###### Your Mind Rests in a Quiet Peace Permeated by Bliss in Simply Being Alive

##### Your Mind Will Get Caught up in Your Enjoyments or Passions

###### I Spent Many, Many Hours Enjoying Writing This Work

###### But even when Your Mind is Engaged in other Activities, there is a Background Blissful Feeling that Never Leaves You

##### Special means He Can't Be Spoiled
