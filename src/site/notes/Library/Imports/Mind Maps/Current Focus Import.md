						Designing the ultimate home computer workstation
							My current setup is bad
								Uncomfortable on the forearms
								No space to write notes
								No writing input device
								Chair is not comfortable
								Lighting is bad at night
								Overhead light is bulky and inconvenient
								No place to hold books or documents
							There are some good features
								Thin monitor is excellent
								Monitor is at right height
								Accessories are easily reached
								Lighting can be directed as needed
								Wireless mouse is great
								New illuminated keyboard helps in dark
								Maple finish goes with other stuff
							I would like to redesign now and solve these problems 
								Uncomfortable on the forearms
									Variety of forearm support methods
										Attach forearm supports to desk
											Looks comfortable
											Doesn't go up and down
											Expensive
											Forearms too free to move
											Forearms should be linked to input devise
										Chair mounted forearm pads
											Comfortable
											Inexpensive
											Does not link arm with keyboard
											Forearms should be linked to input devise not the chair
										Wrap around desk
											Similar set up at previous kb home office
											Interferes with chair arm support
											Provides link between input devise and forearm
										Chair mounted keyboard
											Links forearms to input devise
											Does not link forearms to other input devises
											Split keyboards are difficult to use
									Ultimate answer can be worked in to final solution
									Many possible good alternatives
								No space to write notes
									Hand written note on paper will always be necessary
									Even with a digitizer and one note, i will have circumstance where i need to write on paper
									Need a space to write on paper
								No writing input device
									A digitizer is needed
										Get the most out of one note
										Use the kinesthetic learning center
										Handwriting is always helpful
									Many kinds
										Don't need artists tablet
											Angular brush techniques are unnecessary
											Three times as expensive
										Used for notes and quick doodles only
										Cheaper adesso tablet
									What size?
										8" x 6"
											May be best for where it must be placed
											Less expensive
											Difficult to write anywhere on the screen
										12" x 9"
											Easy to write anywhere on the screen
											May be used in place of mouse
											Works better with autocad
											May be too large
												Forearms will rest on the tablet
												Tablet will get dirty
										Depends somewhat on placement
											If between arms, big can be a problem
											If above keyboard, vision can be a problem
											If near mouse, the mouse use space may be hindered
											Between the arms, keyboard and belly seems best.
								Chair is not comfortable
									The armrests are too hard
									The cushions are too hard
									A new chair may be an improvement
									A special relaxation chair may be used
										Special arrangement of parts
										Probably not a good idea
								Lighting is bad at night
									I cant see the keys
									I cant see anything
									Small task lights may be a solution
										Don't know where to find them
										How are they powered
											Battery would eliminate cord
											Batteries run out
									Illuminated keyboard helps a great deal
								Overhead light is bulky and inconvenient
									Can be eliminated with task lighting
								No place to hold books or documents
									A document holder should be used
										Must be located where it does not block access or vision
										Between keyboard and monitor works best
									Used for active reading with mindmanager
									Needs a book page holder
									Clear may be advisable
							Design solution
								Section
									Monitor
									Document holder
									Keyboard
									Tablet
									Belly
								Elevation
									Accessories to left
									Section components in middle
									Mouse on right
								Wrap around desk
								Gel on forearm area
								Monitor may be mounted by an arm to eliminate stand
									Or document holder can be mounted to stand
									Monitor arm that could hold stand would be ideal
									Or i could leave it alone
									Or i could cut it back and make it shallower
								Precision mouse pad
								Cyberpad 
								Articulating armrests
									Solves all the problems without a new desk
									Remove armrests from chair
								Book stand
									Could be mounted to the side of the monitor?
										Left doesn't seem to have enough space
										Right has issues with the light
								Keyboard
									Ergonomic keyboard
										Doesn't have a flat front to fit well with digitizer
									Over keyboard light
