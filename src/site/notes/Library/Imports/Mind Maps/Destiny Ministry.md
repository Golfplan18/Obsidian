## What is the Ministry of Destiny?

### Physical Description

#### A Single Large Building that Looks like a Monastery

##### Monastery

##### Shambala

##### Epic Scale

###### Many Stories High

###### Many Windows

###### The Windows light up as Quate Crystals Are Forged

##### One Building

##### Located on a Remote Mountain top on a Small Island

##### What is the Journey like to the Island?

###### The Ministry Arranges Transport to the Dock a short Distance from the Island

###### The Total Recall Effect

###### They Are Asked to Enter a Flotation Tank, Meditation Pod

###### They Are Hooked up with Electrodes to Monitor Their Heart and Brain Activity

###### They Are Asked to Take a Red Pill (matrix) to Help Put Them into a Trance

###### The Pill Contains DMT

###### Explain that DMT Helps Break down the Barriers between Reality and Imagination

###### The Float Meditation is Intended to Help Them Purge the Emotional Baggage of Their Daily Lives and Prepare Them for the Journey ahead

###### They Are Told that after the Guided Meditation, They Will Be Taken to the Ministry Office to Forge Their Quate Crystals

###### In Their Reality, instead of Being Taken Directly to the Ministry Offices, They Are Taken to a Purgatory Room and Told They Are not Ready for the Quate

###### They Must Enjoin a quest and Face Various Trials to Determine Their Readiness

###### During the Journey, Thomas is Always Mentioning They He Believes They Are Really back in the Meditation Pod and They Never Left

###### Aphrodite Refuses to Believe Him and Consistently Contends the Experience is Happening in the Real World

###### This Literary Mechanism Gets around the Problems with a lack of Realism

###### When They Emerge from the Purgatory Room, the Couple is Taken to a Disembarking Dock and provided a Rowboat to Travel to the Island

###### The Travelers Must Overcome the Sea of Regrets

###### The Rowboat is Too Large to Allow both Oars to Be Operated by a Single Person

###### Both People Must Row Equally to Make the Boat Go Straight

###### If only One Person Rows, the Boat Travels in Circles and Never Reaches the Island

###### If They Don't Exert Equal Effort the Boat Doesn't Remain on Course for the Island, and They Will not Get there

###### The Water between the Departure Dock and the Island is Turbulent

###### The Water Has Currents of Regret

###### Strong Regrets Will Push the Boat off Course

###### The Person Who Feels the Regret Must Row Harder to Overcome it

###### The Rowing Requires Feeling the Regret rather than Turning away from it

###### Powerful Regrets Are Useful for Preventing the Recurrence of Bad Choices

###### Regret is Based on Choice, not on Outcome

###### A Regret Based on Outcome is a Useless Regret

###### Those Regrets Are Overcome through Abandonment

###### If They Dwell Too much on the Regret the Current Takes Them the other Way, Depression

###### If They Don't Hold Hands, the Sand Becomes Increasingly Difficult to Walk through

###### Symbolic of the Need for Family and Support

###### They Reach the End of the Sand, and They Find an Open Meadow of Grass and Low Flowers

###### Symbolic of Youth and Early Growth of Spring

###### The Meadow Gently Rises from the Beach

###### Full of Wonders, Beautiful Flowers

###### Symbolic of Adulthood

###### The Topography is Varied but Generally Rising Steeply Enough to Require Exertion

###### Some Roads Have Dangerous Sections with Cliffs that Drop back to the Sea

###### Each Road Travels a Different Route up the Island toward the Central Peak and the Ministry Building

###### Quates Are on Disks that Can Be Viewed?

###### Select a Destiny like Picking a Book to Check out

###### Do I want People to Have that much Choice?

##### No. The Quate is a Quantum Oscillator the Runs Energy through Two Crystals to Generate a Field of Possibilities that a Person Walks through

### How Does the Ministry Work?

###### How Can Life Circumstances Change so Abruptly without Undoing the Past?

###### Life Circumstances Are the Result of Many Decisions and Actions Anchoring Ourselves to the past

###### Awareness is All that Really Exists

###### The Self Arises due to Continuity of Experience and Memory
