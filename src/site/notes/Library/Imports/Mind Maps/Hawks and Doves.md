# Hawks and Doves

# Primal Power Imbalance

## Men on Average Are 5 Inches Taller and 30 Pounds Heavier than Women

## Men Are Driven by Testosterone, and Built for Muscle Strength and Endurance

## When Men and Women Have Sex, Women Are Most Often in a Completely Vulnerable and Compromised Position Unable to Resist Male Force

## A Sense of Safety and Security is Essential for a Woman to Have Sex with a Man

## This Power Imbalance is Built into Our DNA, Immune to Societies Whims and Fancies

# Transactional Analysis

## Not Inherently Equal

## Male Domineering is Most Natural and Common

## Requires Chivalry to Balance the Scales

### Man Sacrifices His One-on-one Advantage and the Power that Goes with it in order to provide Women Peace of Mind

### Chivalry is a Choice

### Chivalry Can't Be Legislated

# Chivalry, Choosing to Level the Playing Field

## An Ironclad Commitment to Abstain from Coercion

### One-way Requirement

### Only the Stronger Need Make This Choice

### The Stronger is Immune from Coercion, so This Choice Need not Be Reciprocal

## Remove Coercion from Interpersonal Interaction, and what is Left Over?

### Persuasion

#### With Force not an Option, Persuasion is the only Method for Obtaining what Each Person Wants

### Choice

#### With no Compelling Force, Each Decision of Each Party is a Choice Entered into Freely with no Undue outside Influence

### Freedom

#### With Choice Comes Complete Freedom and no Need to Mask Self or Intention

### Honesty

#### Needs and Wants Can Be Shared without Fear of Retaliation or Emotional Violence

### Cooperation

#### The Two Parties Can More Easily Work together as a Team, Each Relying on the Other's Strengths

### Support

#### Shoulds Convert to Support

#### Weaknesses Are Complimented rather than Corrected

#### Insecurity and Anxiety Are Transmuted into Mutual Reliance and Relief

### Security

#### Neither Party Lives in Fear of the other

#### Both Parties Are Physically and Emotionally Protected by the Masculine Strength, Usually of the Male

### Independence

#### Each Party Grants the other Permission to Hold Different Viewpoints, Value Different Things

#### Each Party Has the Strength to Stand Alone, Remaining together Loving but Unattached, Choosing to Be together Moment by Moment for Love's Synergy, Two Standing together Stronger than Each One Alone and apart

##### It Isn't Two Co-dependent Halves Trying to Make a Whole

##### It's Two Strong Independent People Coming together to Create Something Greater than Themselves, a Family

### Sounds like Feminist Idealism, but with One Key Distinction.

#### Women want the Freedom to Live without the Tyranny of Someone Else Making Decisions for Them, just like Men Do

#### The Strength and Size Imbalance between Men and Women Gets in the way of Women Enjoying the Freedom They want and Deserve

#### Feminists want to Use the Force of Law to Level a Private and Interpersonal Playing Field, not a Public One, a Poor Method of Obtaining the Desired Result.

#### Feminists want to Thrust Equality onto the Man, Overriding His Will and Choice

##### It is the Force of Darkness Applied to Darkness

##### It's a Combative Masculine Energy Competing for Men's Souls

##### In Its Victory Lies the Defeat of All Men, the Soul Death of an Emasculated Male.

##### In Removing a Man's Choice, You Remove His Inner Goodness, His Chance for His light to Shine

##### A Man is Neutered, Made less of a Man

#### A Feminine Woman in a Traditional Relationship Wants a Man to Choose Chivalry on His Own.

##### If a Man Has the Character to Be Truly Masculine the Traditional Feminine Woman Has Exactly what the Masculine Feminist is After, Interpersonal Power Equality between Herself and a Man, and She Didn't Have to Sacrifice Her Femininity to Get it

##### This is why Traditional Men Who Embrace Chivalry Are so Highly Prized by Women

Note I said chivalry, not chauvinism

Chauvinism is false chivalry
