## This Research Led Me to Focus on Specific Mental Disciplines

### Throughout This Work, I Use the Words Mental Discipline and Spiritual Practice Interchangeably

#### Some People Are Triggered by the Idea of Discipline and Are Turned off

#### Some People Are Triggered by the Idea of Spiritual Practice, Assuming I’m Peddling Some Form of New Age Nonsense

#### The Activities I Describe Are Mental Disciplines

##### Your Mind Won't Naturally Do Any of These Things

##### If You Don't Consciously Form the Habit, You Won't Obtain the Benefits

#### The Activities Are also Practices

##### They Are Something You Do All the Time, Every Day

##### You Practice These Disciplines until They Become a Habit, Second Nature

##### You want Them to Become Instinctive and Natural so that They Help You when You Need Them

### These Practices and My Descriptions Are as Simple as I Can Make Them

#### Overly Complicated or Esoteric Explanations Benefit no One

#### There is a Simplicity that Comes on the other Side of the Complexity

##### When You Really Understand Something, there Are a Few Key Concepts that You Find Most Important

##### Those Key Concepts Can Be Explained to a Five-year Old, and They Will Understand Them

##### My Special Needs Son Practices These as Appropriate and Necessary

### These Mental Disciplines and Spiritual Practices Are Testable and Repeatable

#### They Lend Themselves to a Personal Form of Scientific Inquiry

#### Test Them out for Yourself and You Be the Judge

#### I Ask You to Accept Nothing on Faith

##### Except Perhaps that These Methods Work and You Should Give Them a Try

### These Practices Have Greatly Improved the Quality of Life for Every Member of My Family

#### I Am Calm, Happy, Relaxed, Content

#### I Am Focused on that Which Brings Me Joy

#### My Son is the One Who Obtains the Most Benefit

##### Because My Practice is Focused on Him

#### It's about Me only Indirectly

##### My Quality of Life is High because I Serve Him

# Brain and Mind

## Body, Brain, Mind, and Consciousness

### Definitions and Distinctions

### Your Body is Composed of Your Brain, Sense Organs and the Supporting Bones, Muscles, and Organs Necessary for Life

### Your Brain is the Interwoven part of the Body that Processes Sense Data.

### Body and Brain Are Physical

### Mind and Consciousness Are not Physical

### Your Mind Emerges from the Activity of the Brain

#### Your Mind Functions to Convert Electrical Impulses on the Brains Neural Network into Concepts and Apprehends Objects

#### The Mind Perceives Objects

#### The Mind Knows the Object it Perceives

### Your Consciousness Emerges from the Activity of the Mind

#### Consciousness Functions to Focus Mental Activity

#### Consciousness Influences Decision Making and Behavior

### Body, Brain, Mind, and Consciousness Are Dependent Related Phenomenon

#### Body and Brain Generate Mind

#### Mind Depends on Body and Brain

#### Mind Generates Consciousness

#### Consciousness Depends on Mind, Which Depends on Body and Brain

## Physical Properties of the Brain

### Your Brain is a Small Lump of Fleshy Material Encased in a Durable Bony Cover for Its Protection

### Your Body is Equipped with Sense Organs that Relay Information to the Brain about the outside World

### Your Body and Brain Are Interconnected in Ways that Can't Be Separated

#### Sense Organs Are Really Extensions of the Brain throughout the Body

#### The Entire Nervous System is part of the Brain

### Your Brain Gathers the Information from Sense Experience in the Form of Electrical Impulses Transmitted among Neural Pathways

### Your Brain is an Organized Collection of Neurons, Chemicals, and other Items that Form a Complex Network

### Your Body and Brain provide Infrastructure Necessary for Mind and Consciousness to Function

## The Brain Functions like a Quantum Computer

### The Computer Analogy

#### Brain Acts like Computer Hardware

#### Mind is like Computer Software

### Your Brain Processes Information at Tremendous Speed

### A Complex Neural Network Increases the Number of Thoughts the Mind Can Process Simultaneously

### Your Brain is a Processor of Thoughts and Sense Data

### The Meaning in the Data Comes from the Mind

## The Mind Emerges from the Activity of the Neural Network in the Brain

### Your Mind Actively Participates in Creating the Perception of Reality

#### Your Body Provides Sense Data

##### Your Brain Actively Fills in Missing Detail

#### The Mind Can Alter Sense Data

##### Attaches Additional Information

##### Generates Feedback Loops

#### Mind Can Generate Sense Experience

##### The Mind is a Sixth Sense Organ

### Your Mind Assembles Everything into a Larger Concept of Reality

#### Mind is not Physical

#### Electrical Impulses in the Brain Generate Mind

##### Can Mind Exist without a Brain?

###### Question for Metaphysics

###### Not in the Physical World

#### The Hard Problem of Consciousness

##### Nobody Knows how This Occurs

# We Hold These Truths to Be Self-evident

## List of Intuitions

### An Intrinsically Existent outside World is Perceived by Us and Others Exactly as it Exists

### Our Perceptions Are Limited by Our Individual Body and Mind

### We Experience an Endless Stream of Experiences while Conscious

### Our Experiences Are Private and not Shared by Others

### Our Existence Had a Beginning and Will Have an End

### We Are a "self" that Exists Independent of the Mind and Body

### The Self is an Observer of Experience and the Possessor of a Body and Mind

### The Self Has Volitional Control of Decision Making

## Our Shared Reality of the outside World

### A Shared Experience

#### As a Social Species Humans Discovered that other Humans Shared a Common Experience of the outside World

#### Though We Can't Be Certain that Others Experience the World as We Do, We Make the Reasonable Assumption that since We Are All Human, We Share the Same Perceptual Experience of the World

### The Fundamental Nature of the outside World

#### At the Most Basic Level, there Are Vibrations and Spaces between Them

##### Particle Physics Has Demonstrated that Everything that Exists Breaks down to Extremely Small Vibrations in Space

##### These Vibrations Are in Motion, so the outside World is not Static and in a Constant State of Change

#### The Vibrations Organize into More Complex Structures

##### Subatomic Particles like Quarks Assemble into Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

##### Protons, Neutrons and Electrons Form Atoms

##### Atoms Interact to Form Molecules

##### Atoms and Molecules Form the Basic Substances at the Smallest Level Perceptible by Our Sensory Systems

#### Substances that Are Large Enough for Perception by Our Sensory Systems Form the Basis of Our Shared Reality

### Perceptible Substances Are the Substrate of Our Shared Reality

#### That Which Can Be Perceived is the Basis of Shared Reality

#### How This is Perceived Depends on Our Concepts, Associations, and Expectations

##### We Perceive a World of Objects and Actions, but Most of This in Created in Our Own Minds

##### How Our Minds Conceive the World Can Vary Greatly from Person to Person

##### We Believe Others Perceive the World as We Do, but it is not Actually the case

### The Worlds We Construct on the Scaffolding of Perceptible Substances Varies More than We Realize

#### We Build Our Worlds on Concepts, Associations, and Expectations

##### Many of the Expectations Are Perceptual and Automatic Operating below Our Level of Consciousness

##### Many of the Associations Were Built up through Years of Developmental Experience Starting in Infancy

##### Many of the Concepts Were Taught to Us by Experience or Transferred by Culture

#### We Believe These Properties Are in the Object

##### When We Perceive an Object, We Believe the Properties of that Object Belong to it

##### We Think the Object Has Intrinsic Existence

##### We Believe the Object Would Have These Properties whether or not a Consciousness Perceived Them

##### This is not the case

##### Properties Are in Our Minds, not in the Objects

#### Objects Are a Creation of Mind

##### The outside World Contains no Discrete Objects

##### We Discern Objects in Our Environment because This Has Useful Survival Benefits

##### However, These Objects only Exist in Our Minds

##### In the outside World, there is only Perceptible Substrate

## A Persistent Awareness Exists

### The Awareness is Input Linked to Perceptual Systems

### The Perceptual Systems Are Confined to a "body" Isolated in Space and time

### Awareness Combined with Memory Creates Our Sense of time and Existence

#### To Exist is to Exist as Something from One Moment to the next

#### Without Awareness, there Would Be Nothing to Remember

#### Without Memory, there Would Be no Cognition of Awareness

## Awareness is Aware of It's Own Activity and Existence

### Awareness of Awareness Creates a Strong Sense of Self

#### Awareness of Awareness is the Basic Function of Consciousness

##### Aka Conscious Awareness

#### Subject and Object

##### The Object Observed is the Act of Observing

##### One Instance where Subject and Object Are One

###### Distinction Built into the English Language

Deeply held intuition

#### Often Erroneously Called "self awareness"

#### Posits the "self" Exists as that Something that is Aware

#### This is Innate Self-grasping

#### Awareness is the Observation and Consciousness is the Observer

### Conscious Awareness Has Limitations

#### Perceptual System provide Limited Input on the "outside" Environment

#### Creates a Sense of Self and Not-self

#### The Self Feels Distinct from It's Environment though it Can Interact with it

### Conscious Awareness Has Privileged Access

#### Information not Directly Shareable with Others

##### The Perceived Observer is Separated from the Environment

##### Loneliness and Isolation

#### Root of All Subjective Experience

#### We Share a Common Environmental Existence but We Do not Share Individual Experiences of that Common Environment

### The Awareness and Isolation Create Strong Intuitions of a Separate Observer and Possessor

## Conscious Awareness Provides a Strong Sense of Separation from the Body and Mind

### Intuition is that the Body is the Possessed and Consciousness is the Possessor

### The Possessor and Observer Feel like there is an Object, a "you" that is Distinct, Separate, and "real"

#### It Feels like This "you" Exists Independently of the Body, Brain, and Perceptual Systems it Interacts with

#### "you" Believe You Are Your Consciousness

## Conscious Awareness Exercises Some Degree of Volitional Control over the Activities of the Body and Mind

### A Strong Sense of Self and Self-determination

### Volitional Control is the Primary Reason Consciousness Exists at All

# The Insubstantial Self

## Who Am I?

### Why Do You Have to Be Anything?

#### A Strong Intuition that "I" Exist

##### Appears Self Evident

##### Accepting the Belief that "I" Doesn't Exist that way We Perceive it is Extremely Difficult

#### The Essence of Self-grasping

#### Self-grasping Leads to Self-cherishing

##### The Root of All Suffering

#### Can You Be Okay with Being Nothing?

### What if You Are Nothing at All?

### What if You Are Merely an Illusion Created by the Persistence of Memory and Imputation?

### If You come to Accept that "you" Are Merely an Activity of the Mind, You Let Go of Many Sources of Suffering

#### You also Notice a Dramatic Quieting of the Mind

##### About 80% of Normal Thought is about Yourself

##### Your Mind Becomes More Peaceful

##### You Become Harder to Disturb

#### Self Loathing and Abuse Goes away

#### Embarrassment Arises less Often

#### Self Aggrandizement Stops

#### Self Importance Falls to near Zero

#### You Start Thinking about Others and Their Needs

#### You Become a Better Person

### Despite the Importance of Abandoning the Sense of Self as All-important, Most People Don't even Consider the Possibility

## What about Me?

### I Think; Therefore, I Am

#### Awareness and Cognition Do not Require an "I"

#### Most People Impute an "I" onto Their Thought Process

##### Leads to Innate Self-grasping

##### Leads to the False Impression of Intrinsic Existence

#### Why Do You Have a Voice in Your Head?

##### Wouldn't You Already Know what You Think?

##### What is the Purpose of Restating These Thoughts in Your Mind?

##### If You Were Your Thoughts, You Would not Need to Talk to Yourself

#### Who or what is Listening to the Voice in the Head?

##### If Someone or Something Else, then the Voice is not "you"

#### You Are not Your Thoughts

##### Thinking is Merely a Function of Mind, a Tool

##### Thinking is not Directly within the Control of Consciousness

##### Consciousness is an Observer of Thought

##### Consciousness Can Direct Thought

##### Consciousness Doesn't Actually Produce Thought

## Where Am I in Body, Brain, Mind, and Consciousness?

### Are You Your Body?

#### Your Body is Necessary to provide a Brain and Sustain Life Processes

#### Your Body is a Useful Tool

#### Possessor and the Possessed Are not the Same Entity

#### Your Body is not You

### Are You Your Brain?

#### Your Brain is Necessary to provide the Infrastructure to Generate Mind

#### Your Brain is Merely a part of Your Body, Inseparable from it

#### Your Brain is not You

### Are You Your Mind?

#### Your Mind Emerges from the Activity of the Body and Brain

#### There is no Mind without a Body and Brain

##### There is no Documented case of a Mind Existing without a Brain

##### If it Were Possible, We Would Have Found One

#### Your Mind Has Tremendous Power due to the Computing Power of the Brain

#### Your Mind Processes a Great Deal of Information that Consciousness is not Aware of

##### If You Are Your Mind, You Don't Know 99% of Who You Are

##### Are You both the Observer and Observed?

#### You Are not Your Mind

### Are You Your Consciousness?

#### How Would You Separate Consciousness from the Mind?

##### Consciousness is an Awareness of Thoughts in the Mind

##### Consciousness is One of Those Thoughts

##### Consciousness Emerges from Mind

#### Most People Self-identify with Consciousness, a Small Subset of Thoughts in the Mind

### Your Consciousness is not You

#### Most People Impute a "self" onto Their Conscious Experience

##### This is an Illusion of Mind

##### Awareness is Aware of Itself

###### Consciousness is One of the Processes of Mind that Consciousness is Aware of

###### The Awareness that is Unique to Consciousness is Consistent and Persistent

###### The Awareness is Aware of Itself and Its Persistence due to Memory

##### The Awareness of Awareness Creates Innate Self-identification

###### We Typically Call This Self Awareness

###### It's More Accurately Characterized as an Awareness of Awareness

###### No Self is Required

##### Self is Inputted by Memory and Persistence over time

###### Innate Self Identification

###### It is Merely a Concept in the Mind

###### There is Nothing Real or Substantial here

#### Most People Believe Consciousness is Intrinsic rather than Emergent

##### People Endow Their Self with Characteristics is Does not Have

###### Exists from it Own Side

###### Immutable

###### Permanent

###### Existing Independent of the Brain and Mind that Generates it

This is a matter of debate

What happens after death?

##### Consciousness is not the Soul

##### Consciousness is not Permanent

##### Consciousness Does not Exist outside the Mind and Brain it Emerges from

#### Innate Self-importance Follows Innate Self-identification

##### Survival Benefit

###### Take Care of the Body and Brain Responsible for the Self

###### Same Reasons Our Natural Instincts Make Us Unhappy

##### Privileged Access

###### The Information Presented to Consciousness Can't Be Shared with Others

###### Loneliness of Self

###### Uniqueness of Self

###### Uniqueness Creates Specialness

## Am I My Soul?

### What Precisely is the Soul?

#### Does it Have Physical Properties?

##### Nobody Has Convincingly Measured Any

##### Does it Exist in the Physical World in Any Way?

###### Scientists Generally Do not Believe so

#### Is it Strictly a Mental Phenomenon?

##### If So, Can We regard it as Real

##### If So, Can it Be Immutable and Survive Death

#### How Does the Soul Store Information?

##### Physically?

##### Mentally?

##### Some other Way?

#### Repository of the Self

##### Basis of Imputation of the "I"

#### Starting point for Many Metaphysical Beliefs of the Afterlife

### Buddhists Posit the Very Subtle Mind

#### Gross Mind Ends

#### No Memories Survive Death

#### No Personality Survives Death

#### Only Imprints of past Thoughts and Deeds Persist

##### The Santa Clause List

##### Some Schools of Buddhism Have a Soul-like Mechanism in the Very Subtle Mind, Which is the Recorder and Depository for Karma. This "soul", if You want to Call it That, is Changing All the Time. Each Thought, Feeling, Action is Recorded as Karma, and This is Postulated to Survive Death. It Contains None of Our Memories, Experiences, or "qualia" from Our Previous Lives, but it Contains the Imprints on Our Karma. Without This Mechanism, there is no way for Karma to Follow You from One Incarnation to the Next. The Very Subtle Mind is like a Punch Card Recording Your Every Activity and Reaction. I Guess Santa Clause Must Know how to Read This Punch Card to Determine Who's Been Naughty and Who's Been Nice.

##### Of Course, Some Deep Thinkers of the time Pointed out there Are Some Ontological Issues with the Idea. If the Self is Merely an Ephemeral Group of Ideas in Your Mind (which it is), what Exactly Survives Death, and how Does Karma Pass from Lifetime to Lifetime? Not All Buddhist Schools come up with the Same Answer, but the Tibetan Buddhists and Many other Buddhist Traditions Embrace the Idea of the Very Subtle Mind.

##### To Many Buddhists, You Have a Gross Mind, a Subtle Mind, and a Very Subtle Mind. The Gross Mind is what You Experience in Ordinary Consciousness. The Subtle Mind is Akin to a light Dream State where You Can Still Have Awareness of Mental Activity, and Tibetans Developed a Dream Yoga to Experience and Explore This Idea. However, the Very Subtle Mind is Posited as the Mechanism for Carrying Karma.

##### I Imagine the Very Subtle Mind like a Punch Card. It Contains None of the Memories or Experiences of Your past Life, but it Records All the Karmic Imprints Created by Your Thoughts and Actions. You Take This Punch Card with You from Life to Life, and when Karma Ripens, the Actual Cause Was from Some past Imprint Carried by the Very Subtle Mind.

##### Obviously, This Can't Be Tested, so the Existence of a Very Subtle Mind is Based on Faith Alone. It Posits a Mechanism for Cause and Effect that Carries Emotional Benefits for Those Who Chose to Believe it (you Don't Ask why Bad Things happen.) If You Reject the Very Subtle Mind, Reincarnation, and the Ideas Associated with It, You Remove the Sign from the Rabbit-hole of Suffering that Comes with Speculating on "why" Bad Things Occur. Without that Sign, Many People Go down that Rabbit Hole Again and Again and Suffer the Consequences.

### Hindus Posit an Eternal Soul

#### Become One with Brahman at Death

### Christians Posit an Everlasting Self

#### Memories of Life

#### Continued Mental Processing

#### New Memories Can Be Added from Activity in the Afterlife

### You Are Free to Believe whatever You want about the Soul

#### It Isn't Something that Can Be Tested and Verified

##### Although We Are Fairly Certain that if it Exists, it Isn't Physical

##### Nobody Has Posited a Scientifically Testable Theory as to how Information in Mind Can Survive Death

#### Widely Held Opinion Does not Create Fact

## What Am I?

### The Self You Cling to is not a Thing

### You Are an Activity

### The Self is like the English Grammar Concept of a Gerund

#### A Verb Put into Service as a Noun

#### An Activity that is Perceived as an Object

### Other than the Activity of Mind, You Are Nothing at All

### First, Some Buddhist Traditions Don't Teach that the Self Doesn't Exist. The Teaching is that the Self Doesn't Exist Intrinsically, like Physical Objects. The Self is an Illusion Created by Mind. The Self is Actually the Perception of a Mental Process. We Bring the Self into Existence Moment-by-moment in a Process of "selfing". It's like the English Linguistic Concept of a Gerund, a Verb Pressed into Service as a Noun. If I Say "walking is fun." I Made the Verb "walk" into a Noun "walking". Similarly, I Can Take the Mental Activity of "selfing" and Turn it into a Noun, "self". We Do it so Instinctively that We Don't Realize that Thing We Created out of an Activity Isn't Real or Physical. It's a Mental Activity Masquerading as a Real Thing. We even Concoct Words to Hold This Thing, Most Notably the Idea of "soul." the Self is an Illusion Created by Mental Processes and the Persistence of Memory. It Has no Existence beyond That, Which means it Doesn't Exist Intrinsically.

## Can I Ever Find Salvation?

### "you" Will Never Be Saved

### Salvation is Abandoning the Self

### Salvation is Leaving Yourself behind

# An Unsatisfactory Life

## People Were Equipped by God or Nature to Survive

### System of Punishments and Rewards to Drive Survival Behavior

#### Obtaining Resources Brings Pleasure

#### Avoiding Dangerous Situations Reduces Pain

#### Ignoring Situations that Are neither Pleasurable or Dangerous Saves Energy

### Survival Systems Create Automatic Responses

#### Seek More of Pleasurable Items or Experiences

#### Avoid Harmful or Unpleasant Experiences

#### Ignore Information that is not a Source of Pleasure or Pain

### Automatic Responses Lead to Suffering

#### Grasping at Pleasure Leads to Attachment

#### Aversion to Pain Leads to Anger and Hatred

#### Ignorance Leads to Delusion and Poor Decisions

#### Attachment, Aversion, and Delusion Are the Root Causes of All Suffering

## Survival Success Requires Dissatisfaction

### Pleasure Must Fade

#### Biological Needs Are Ongoing

#### New Resources Must Be Obtained

#### Reproduction is not 100% effective

### Subsequent Pleasure Events Must Produce less Satisfaction

#### Too much Pleasure Becomes a Source of Suffering

#### Law of Diminishing Returns

#### Just Enough Pleasure to Keep Us Going

### Aversion Creates Worry and Anxiety

#### Must Constantly Scan the Environment for Potential Sources of Danger

#### Vigilance is Worry

#### Anticipation of or Fear of Unpleasant Future Events Creates Anxiety

### Worry and Anxiety Increase Dissatisfaction with Life

#### Steady Stream of Unpleasant Thoughts and Feelings

##### Worry is a Persistent Vigilance

##### Anxiety is a Persistent Fear of the Future

#### Unpleasant Effect on the Body

##### Muscle Tension

##### Physical Ailments

### Worry and Anxiety Must not Fade

#### Need for Vigilance is Ongoing

#### Loss of Vigilance Could Lead to Death

#### Worry and Anxiety Have Survival Benefit

### Ignorance Saves Energy

#### Consciousness, Mind and Brain Activity Consumes Tremendous Amounts of Energy

#### Reducing Awareness and Mental Processing Reduces Energy Consumption

#### Conserving Energy Has Survival Advantage

##### You Need Energy for Real Emergencies

##### Depleted Energy Levels is Dangerous

### Survival is More Important than Happiness

#### Survival is Selfish by Nature

#### Innate Self-grasping

#### People Were Designed to Survive

#### People Were not Designed to Be Happy

## The Delusion of Selfish Happiness

### The Self Believes it Can Do and Have it All

#### We Can Obtain Everything We Desire

#### We Can Keep Everything We Obtain

#### We Can Avoid Everything We Do not want

#### We Can Avoid Sickness and Death

##### Our Self Identity Persists Eternally

### Happiness Can Be Achieved by Selfish Activities

#### Fulfillment of Our Desires is the Most Important Thing

#### Maximize Resource Acquisition

#### Minimize Danger

#### Conserve Energy for above

### The Self Drives All Behavior toward Selfish Ends

#### Based on Incorrect Beliefs

#### Causes Most Non-virtuous Behavior

#### Leads instead to Suffering

### All Unhappiness Comes from the Desire to Be Happy

### All Happiness Comes from the Desire to Make Others Happy

## The Suffering of Selfishness Can't Be Avoided, only Abandoned

### The Activity of the Self Never Leads to Happiness

### The Activity of the Self Creates Endless Suffering

### The Self Cannot Be Fixed

#### The Self Cannot Be Retrained

##### Suppression of Desire Always Fails

##### Believing the Self Can Be Helped Merely Extends Suffering

#### The Self Itself is the Problem

### Abandonment of Self is the only Viable Answer

## Innate Kindness and Selflessness

### Our Biology Provides an Opposing Force

#### Care Giving Behavior

##### Placing the Needs of Others above the Needs of Self

##### Direct Opposition to Selfishness

#### Instinct for Self-sacrifice to Help Others

##### Mothers

##### Communal Animals

###### Bees

###### Ants

###### Termites

##### Survival Advantage

###### Direct Relationship between Motherly Care and Survival Rates

###### Groups Have Power over Individuals

#### Typical of Mothers toward Offspring

##### Immediacy and Urgency of Care

### Innate Kindness

#### Kindness is Built into Our Biology

##### Positive Feelings Arise when We Engage in Selfless Actions

##### Quiet Voice of Our Conscience

##### It Could Have Been Different

#### Actions Benefiting Others

##### Any Deed that Benefits Others is a Kindness

##### Intention is Secondary

###### Best with an Intention to Help

#### Actions

##### Can Be Thoughts or Deeds

##### Deeds Are Most Noticeable

###### Actions Speak Louder than Words

##### Holding Good Intentions is an Action

##### Wishing Others to Be Happy is an Action

#### Benefits

##### Anything the Improves the Life of Another

##### Can Be Very Small

###### Opening a Door

###### Cleaning a Space Used by Others

#### Others

##### The Focus Should Be on Others

##### Opposite of Self-cherishing

### Selflessness

#### There is Hope for Us

#### Selfless Actions Benefiting Others is the Key to Happiness and Peace of Mind

# The Essence of Spiritual Practice

## Practice versus Belief

### People Often Confuse Religious Belief and Spiritual Practice

### Religious Belief is Something You Fervently Wish Were True because Believing so Makes You Feel Good

#### Belief is Generally Based on Faith rather than Empirical Evidence

#### Belief is Passive and Doesn't Require Action of Any Kind

### Spiritual Practice is a Disciplined Mental and Emotional Activity Undertaken for a Specific End Result, Usually Peace of Mind

#### Spiritual Practice is Supported by Experience and Empirical Evidence

##### If it Didn't Work, People Wouldn't Engage in the Practice

##### If It's not Working, Read the Instructions Again and Make Sure You Are Doing it Properly

##### Most of These Techniques Have a 2,500 Year History of Success

#### Spiritual Practice is counter to the Natural Tendencies of the Mind

##### It Requires Discipline because the Mind Doesn't Do it Automatically

##### The Things the Mind Does Automatically Are Usually Self-serving and Non-virtuous

##### If it Didn't Require Discipline, it Would Be a Bad Habit

#### Spiritual Practice is Necessary because an Untrained Mind Leads to Bad Behaviors, Negative Outcomes, and Emotional Suffering

### The Fool's Errand of Instant Enlightenment

#### The Term Enlightenment Comes from Buddhism

##### Satori, a Flash of Insight

#### Christianity Has the Transformation of the Heart by the Holy Spirit

#### New Age Has the Dark Night of the Soul

##### Eckhart Tolle Experience

#### Many Spiritual Seekers and Religious Adherents Are Looking for that One Magic Belief or Realization that Will Remove All Pain and Suffering

#### A Single Belief, Realization, or Event is Believed to Purge All Negativity

#### It Doesn't Work that Way, even in Buddhism

#### It's a Spiritual Shortcut to Avoid the Difficult and Disciplined Work of Real Spiritual Practice

#### Its like Playing a Lottery where Nobody Actually Wins

#### Chasing This Dream is an Enormous Waste of time and Energy

## Practice versus Ritual

### Rituals Are Specific Events or Activities, Often in a Group Setting

#### Church Service

#### Meditation Group

### Rituals Have a Defined Beginning and End

### A Practice is a Continuous Activity

#### Practices Are Something You Engage in 24/7

#### Practices Are Engrained as Habits

#### Practices Become part of Your Character

### People Often Confuse Participating in Religious Rituals with Engaging in a Spiritual Practice

#### Some Rituals Are Intended to Emulate Practice

#### Ritual Can Be a part of Practice an Support it

#### But a Ritual is not a Substitution for Forming the Proper Mental Disciplines

## Practice versus Play

### Most People Who Play Sports at a High Level Spend Many Hours Practicing to Hone Their Skills

### The Purpose of Practice in Sports is to Perfect the Skills so that under the Pressure to Perform in Play, the Performance is Natural and well Executed

### Spiritual Practice, including Meditation, is Practice in Preparation for the Challenges of Real Life

### Learning to Do the Right Things at the Right time when there is no Pressure is the Best Preparation when Life Presents Challenges

## Developing Awareness of Mental Activity

### The Most Basic Function of Spiritual Practice

### Beginners Meditation Practice

#### Observe the Mind

### Thoughts, the Voice in Your Head

## Directed Attention

### Your Mind's Radar System

#### Reticular Activating System

##### Special Hardware Built into the Brain

#### Mind Scans Sense Data from the Environment

##### Most Sense Data is Meaningless

##### Important Information Must Be Found in the Noise

#### Essential to Survival

##### Maximizes Mental Efficiency

##### Increased Sensitivity to Useful Resources

##### Increased Sensitivity to Danger

##### Moves Focus away from Meaningless Objects

#### Cause of Suffering if Left Untrained

##### Seeks to Obtain Objects of Attachment

##### Seeks to Avoid Objects of Aversion

#### Can Be Directed by Consciousness

##### Concentration and Intention

##### Purpose of Spiritual Training

### The Results of Mental Focus

#### Mental Focus or Concentration

##### Short Term Direction of Awareness

##### Direct Conscious Awareness

#### Intention

##### Long Term Direction of Awareness

##### Taps into Power of Subconscious Processing

#### Mental Focus Can Create Happiness or Suffering

##### What You Focus on

##### Amount of time Spent

#### What You Focus on

##### Virtue versus Non-virtue

##### Pleasant versus Unpleasant

##### Worry versus Joy

#### Percent of time Spent

##### Simple Measure

##### Pie Chart with Three Areas

###### Good

###### Bad

###### Neither

##### Reveals Depth of Suffering

## Cultivate a Mind of virtue

### Mind is like Fertile Soil

### Virtuous and Non-virtuous Minds

#### What Distinguishes virtue from Non-virtue?

##### All Non-virtuous Minds Are Generated by Self-grasping and Self-cherishing (self-importance)

##### All Virtuous Minds Are Generated by the Desire to Cherish Others

#### Non-virtuous Minds

##### Non Virtuous Minds Are the Easiest to Describe and Relate to

##### They Are the Easiest to Generate and Maintain

###### They come Naturally

###### They Are Self-sustaining

##### Types of Non-virtuous Minds

###### Anger

###### Attachment

###### Delusion

##### Non-virtuous Minds Are Always a Source of Suffering

#### Virtuous Minds

##### Virtuous Minds Can Never Be the Source of Suffering

##### Virtuous Minds Do not come Naturally and Must Be Cultivated

### Mind either Creates virtue and Happiness or Non-virtue and Suffering

#### Consciousness is the Awareness of the End State of an Ongoing Process of Thoughts and Feelings Interacting

#### Consciousness Merely Reacts to the Thoughts and Feelings Generated by Mind

#### Computer Programming Analogy

##### Garbage In, Garbage out

##### Consciousness Builds on the Raw Materials provided by Mind

##### Bad Inputs Lead to Bad Outputs

#### Cultivating Virtuous Minds is Preferable

#### All Suffering Comes from Creating and Sustaining Non-virtuous Minds

# Key Features of a Good Life

## Opinions on Living a Good Life

### Everyone Had a Different Opinion on what it means to Live a Good Life

### Philosophers like to Debate what it means to Live a Good Life

### There Are Many Spiritual, Religious, and Ethical Systems Designed to Facilitate Living a Good Life

### The Common Thread Running through Most Opinions about a Good Life is the Desire for a Peaceful Mind and a Sustained Feeling of Joy and Happiness

## There Are Several Different Culturally Prominent Views on what Constitutes a Good Life

### Hedonist Pleasure

#### Pleasure and Pain Are Natural and Universal

##### Seeking Pleasure and Avoiding Pain Are a Most Basic Life Philosophy

##### The End State is a Mental Emotional State of Continuous Pleasure with no Pain

#### The Problems Are Numerous

##### Pleasure Fades Quickly

###### It's Difficult to Sustain a Continuous State of Pleasure

###### Heroin Use is an Attempt to Sustain Pleasure Indefinitely

###### Even when Successful it Leads to other Problems

Health problems

Failure to seek and secure survival resources

##### When Pleasure Fades, Pain is Magnified

###### When a Hedonist Can't Obtain the Pleasures They Are Accustomed To, the Pain of This Loss is Very Unpleasant

###### Ask Any Drug Addict why They Can't Quit

##### Seeking Individual Pleasure is the Root of All Bad Social Behavior

###### Hedonistic Pleasures Often come at the expense of other People

###### Sexual Exploitation, Theft, and so on

#### Overcoming the Problems of Hedonism

##### Most Religious and Spiritual Traditions Are a Direct Response to the Weaknesses of the Hedonist Life Philosophy

##### These Systems Reduce or Eliminate the Reliance on Pleasure

###### Substitute Something that Does not Fade as Quickly or Easily

###### Focus on Ideas or Concepts that Generate Positive or Uplifting Feelings

###### Employ Reminders and Rituals to Keep the Feelings Active

##### The Common Substitutes

###### Acceptance

Pleasant feelings from believing you are loved and accepted by others

###### Joy

Pleasant feeling from bringing pleasure or happiness to another person

###### Satisfaction

Beyond the baser satisfaction of immediate needs

Pleasant feeling associated with a task done well

###### Duty

Joy and satisfaction obtained from fulfilling obligations to others or a group

### Religious and Devotional

#### People Need to Live together in Large Groups

##### Hedonistic Societies Tend toward Anarchy

##### Clans, Tribes, Nations, Society All Requires Group Cooperation

##### Hedonists Are Disruptive to Groups due to Their Tendency for Exploitation

##### Religious and Devotional Traditions provide a Unity

###### Unifying Belief Structure

###### Set of Rules and Dogmas to counter Hedonist Problems

#### Belief in Deities Based on Faith

##### Concept of Supernatural Beings is as Old as Humanity

##### In the Absence of Evidence, Believers Choose to Believe Based on Faith

###### If You Choose to Believe, You Obtain the Benefits of Belief

###### If You Chose not to Believe, You Don't

##### Members of the Group Focus on Something outside Themselves, More Powerful than Themselves

###### Leads to Dogma, or Instructions on how to Please God

###### If Used for Good, it Promotes virtue and Selflessness

##### Whether It's One God or Many, Moving the Focus away from Hedonistic Selfishness Provides Opportunity to Solve the Problems of Hedonism

#### God Loves You

##### If You Believe in a Deity, and You Believe This Deity Loves You

###### You Gain the Pleasure and Comfort of Unlimited Unconditional Love and Acceptance

###### The Joy of God's Love Does not Fade like Hedonist Pleasure

##### The New Problem is how to Sustain the Feeling of Joy in God's Love

###### This Doesn't Fade like Hedonistic Pleasure

###### Joy Fades More Slowly as a Result of lack of Focus

##### Periodic Religious Gatherings or Rituals is the Solution

###### Most Religions Have Weekly Services or Daily Practices

###### Muslims Pray 6 times per Day

###### The Periodic Reminder of God's Love Keeps the Joy Fresh

###### If Practiced, This Works well for Sustaining Joy

#### The Problems with Religious or Devotional Philosophies

##### All Religious Traditions Are Prone to Corruption of Selfish Actors

##### Religious Dogmas Are Varied, Intellectually Inconsistent, and Often Contradictory

###### Doubt in the Dogma Becomes Doubt in the Faith

##### Religious Righteousness Causes Splinter Groups and Violence

###### The World Has a long History of Wars and Conflicts Based on Religious Differences

###### While Most Religious Teachings Admonish Hate, Many Religious Practitioners Embrace it

##### Dogmas and Rules Don't Address the Underlying Mental and Emotional Problems that Cause People Disturbance

###### Accepting God's Love Isn't a Magic Elixir that Cures All Ills

The belief that the holy spirit enters your heart and transforms you

Great idea, but rarely does it result in lasting change

The problems of mental disturbance are generally too deep and intertwined for a single event to cleanse them

###### The Thoughts and Feelings that Drive Behavior Don't Change by Accepting a Collective Belief System

### New Age Oneness

#### New Age Philosophies Are a Grab-bag of Ideas from Religious and Secular Sources

##### There is no Single New-age Philosophy of Life

##### There Are Common Threads, and They All Work in a Similar Fashion

##### Promote Joy over Pleasure for the More Lasting Effect

#### New Age Philosophies of Life Generally Diminish the Importance of the Self

##### The Problems with Hedonism Are Rooted in Selfishness

##### New Age Philosophies Generally Promote Collective Good over Selfish Ends

#### New Age Philosophies Appeal to Joy over Pleasure

##### Like Religious or Devotional Philosophies, New Age Oneness is an Appeal to Take Joy in the Happiness of Others

##### We Are All the Same, and We Are All in This together

#### Problem with New Age Philosophies

##### New Age Philosophies Generally Avoid the Corruptions of Religion

###### Most New Age Philosophies Are Embraced by Individuals Who Most Often Don't Participate in Group Worship

Unitarian churches are not widely attended

Of course, that also means it lacks some of the benefits of religion

Group cohesion and support

Ritual to sustain feelings of joy

###### Still Prone to Problems of Corruption and Exploitation of Charismatic Leaders

##### New Age Philosophies Still Require Ritual and Reminders to Sustain Joy

##### New Age Philosophies Generally Don't provide a means to Cleanse the Mind and Heart of Negative Influences

###### Mindfulness Meditation Helps

Daily activity is not widely practiced

Often lacks focus or an objective beyond watching mental activity

### Psychologists, Self-actualization

#### Self-actualization is Akin to Self-satisfaction

##### Secular Strategy for Living a Good Life

##### Born of Psychology, Abraham Maslow

##### Enjoy Satisfaction in Performing a Task well

###### People Should Enjoy Personal Satisfaction

Performing good work is enjoyable

Serving others is a source of joy

Writing this book was a source of personal satisfaction

###### It just Isn't a Complete Philosophy of Living

##### It's a Higher Level Pleasure than Hedonism

##### Like Religion, it Taps into Joy rather than Pleasure

#### Problems with Self-actualization and Secular Strategies

##### People Can Become Self-satisfied with Non-virtuous Behavior

###### A Serial Killer Can Be Self-actualized in Killing

##### To Sustain the Joy Requires Internal Reminders Akin to Self Aggrandizement

##### Promotes Ego-centric Beliefs and Behaviors

###### Delusional Self-importance

##### Requires Continuing the Activity in order to Sustain the Feeling of Satisfaction

###### Becomes a Problem if the Activity Must Be Ceased

###### Motivates People to Work to long and Too Hard

### Confucius, Polished Character

#### Https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confucianism

#### Confucianism Places and Emphasis on Family and Social Harmony

##### Confucianism is Perhaps the Oldest and Most Widely Practiced Ethical System

###### It Has Successfully United the Chinese Culture for Thousands of Years

###### Confucianism is Essentially a well Thought out Rulebook for Behavior and Ethical Consideration

##### Confucianism Has no God or Otherworldly Source of Spiritual Values

###### Contrasts with Western Religious Traditions

###### It's All Dogma with no Religion or Supernatural Belief to Support it

##### Confucianism Rests upon the Belief that Human Beings Are Fundamentally Good, and Teachable, Improvable, and Perfectible through Personal and Communal Endeavor, Especially Self-cultivation and Self-creation

#### Confucianism Has much in Common with Secular New Age Philosophies

##### Most Are Rooted in the Idea of Self Improvement

##### Confucianism is a Guide to Self Improvement with the Goal of Social Harmony

#### Problems with Confucianism

##### Confucianism in Unconcerned with the Happiness of the Individual

###### Social Harmony and Familial Affinity Can Lead to Satisfaction with Life

But not necessarily so

##### People Can Feel Pretentious and False

###### They Are following Rules rather than Acting Naturally

###### They Curb Their Baser Instincts, but They Don't Work to Prevent Their Non-virtuous Desires from Arising

Same problem as most religious systems

##### It Places Social Harmony above Personal Experience

###### The Spiritual Rewards Are not Emphasized, though They May Be Present

### Stoic Eudaimonia

#### Https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eudaimonia

#### Aristotle's Idea of the Highest Good

##### Often Translated as a State or Condition of Good Spirit, Happiness, or Welfare

##### It is a General Mood or State of Mind

###### A Recipient of Blessings, God's or Otherwise

#### How to Achieve Eudaimonia is the point of Stoic Philosophy and Teaching

##### Live with virtue

###### Living a Virtuous Life Rewards People with Good Spirit, a Pleasant State of Mind

###### Most Ethical Systems, even Those Rooted in Religion, Agree on This point

##### Virtuous Activity in accordance with Reason

###### Wisdom Teaching for when Virtues Conflict

#### Problems with Stoic Philosophy and Ethical Systems

##### They Are Generally a Difficult and Complicated Set of Rules to Follow

##### The Rules Are Sometimes Cryptic and Subject to Multiple Interpretations

##### The Assumption is that People Are Naturally Inclined to Be Bad and Need Rules to Curb Their Bad Instincts

###### Ethical System Rarely Go after the Root Cause of Selfish Desire

##### People Can Easily Rationalize Breaking the Rules

#### Everyone Needs Some Kind of Ethical System

##### Desires Will Always Be in Conflict even if the Desires Are Virtuous

##### Wisdom is Needed to Make Choices among Competing Ends

### Eckhart Tolle, Bliss of Being

#### Eckhart Tolle is a Modern, New Age Philosopher and Spiritual Teacher

##### His Teachings Borrow Heavily from Buddhism and Convey His Own Personal Experience

##### He Embraces the "no self" Teachings of Buddhism as He Found His Sense of Self a Source of much Emotional Discomfort

##### He Embraces the New Age "oneness" Idea that We Are All Fundamentally the Same and Emanate from the Same Nothingness

##### His Most Famous Teaching is to Remain Completely Focused on the Present Moment

##### He also Extols the Virtues of Non-judgement, Non-attachment, and Non-resistance

#### A Quiet Mind that Enjoys "the Bliss of being"

##### The Ultimate State of Being

##### A Definition He Shares with Buddhist Enlightenment

##### He Literally Advocates a State of "no thought" or at Least a Conscious Ignorance to the Many Thoughts the Mind Always Generates

##### He Contends there is a Blissful State of Being Most Are not Aware of due to Mental Distractions

###### While This is True, It's also Difficult to Experience First-hand

##### His "pain body" Analogy is Very Useful

###### Helps to Identify a Problem

###### Helps to Realize Painful Thought Patterns Are a Mental State that Can and Should Be Cut off at the Earliest Opportunity

##### Most Experienced Meditators Have Tasted the Blissful State Tolle Describes

###### Few Learn how to Sustain it

##### I Am a Big Fan of Eckhart Tolle

###### I Find Few Flaws with His Outlook or Teachings

###### My Personal way of Life is Strongly Correlated with His Ideas

##### He is Criticized for His "tune out" Ideas

###### He Does not Embrace the Need for Fulfilling Work

###### Nothing Wrong with It, just not Necessary

##### His Bliss of Being is Akin to Drug Addiction without Drugs

##### His Teachings Are a Bit light on the "how to" part

###### Meditate, Quiet Your Mind, Focus on the Present, and the Rest Takes Care of Itself

### Tibetan Buddhism

#### I Have Studied and Practiced Buddhism for More than Half My Life

##### The Practice Hasn't Always Been Consistent and Focused

##### I Find Some Traditions within Buddhism Lacking in Guidance, and I Lost Focus

##### I Am Certainly not Enlightened

###### I Am far less Disturbed by Life Events than I Used to Be

###### I Feel the Benefits of a More Peaceful Mind and Increased Joy

###### I Don't Know that Anyone Ever Reaches an End State where They Don't Need to Practice

##### I Studied Eckhart Tolle’s Teachings for Several Years

##### I Transitioned from Eckhart Tolle to Tibetan Buddhism

#### I Was Drawn to Tibetan Buddhism for Teachings I Didn't Find Elsewhere

##### Object or Emotive Meditation

##### Study of Opponents to Delusions

#### Definition of Enlightenment

##### The Inner light of Wisdom that is Permanently Free of All Mistaken Appearance, and whose Function is to Bestow Mental Peace upon Each and Every Living Being Every Day.

###### Geshe Kelsang Gyatso - how to Understand the Mind

##### Enlightenment is both a point of view and a State of Mind

###### You Are view Reality Untainted by Delusions and Mistaken Interpretations

###### You Experience a Blissful State Characterized by a Peaceful Mind

#### What an Enlightened Life is not

##### Many Spiritual Seekers Envision a Mental State the is All Bliss, Akin to Heroin Addiction without the Drug

##### Enlightenment is not a Permanent State of Bliss with no Disturbances

##### A Correct, Non-mistaken, Appearance May Be Very Undesirable and Disturbing

###### Ethnic Cleansing, War and Destruction, Disease and Famine

4 horsemen of the apocalypse

###### Even the Enlightened Still Feel Compassion for the Pain and Suffering of Others

##### Sadness is an Unavoidable Feature of Life

##### Pain is an Unavoidable Feature of Life

#### Living with Purpose

##### Tibetan Buddhism Teaches that the Buddha Made a Choice after Becoming Enlightened

###### He Could Have Chosen to Exist in a State of Bliss and Do Nothing

A bit like Eckhart Tolle’s first several years

###### His Compassion for the Suffering of Others Motivated Him to Teach

###### He Didn't Need to Teach for Himself as He Had Everything He Needed for a Great Life

##### Bodhicitta, the Desire to Become Enlightened to Help other People

###### Considered the Highest Form of Motivation in Tibetan Buddhism

###### My Motivation in Writing This Chapter Came from Bodhicitta

##### The Purpose of Life is to Develop a Peaceful Mind and Unmistaken view of Reality in order to Lead Others to the Same State of Being

#### What Sets Enlightened Living apart from other Ways of Life

##### The Blissful State of a Peaceful Mind is Embraced by Most Philosophies of a Good Life

##### Tibetan Buddhism and Buddhist Enlightenment Provides a Series of Practices Designed to Purify Your Mind to Obtain that Peaceful State

###### In Short, They provide a Path with Instructions on how to Get there

###### Applying Opponents to Mental Disturbances

###### Lamrim, Lamp to the Path to Enlightenment

##### With a Pure Mind, You Don't Wrestle with Many Conflicting Emotions that Stem from Personal Desires

##### Thought is the Forerunner of All Things

###### From Virtuous Thought Comes Good Decisions and Appropriate Behaviors

## Life Philosophies Are All means to a Pleasant End State

### Nobody Wants to Live a Life with Unpleasant Experiences

#### Disturbing Thoughts

##### Negative Judgment of Others, Loss of Reputation, lack or Loss of Resources

#### Suffering with what They Don't want

##### Although Good Philosophies of Life also provide a means for Accepting This

#### Lack of Meaning and Purpose

#### Lack of Resources and Pleasures

### People want to Experience Joy, Happiness, and Peace-of-mind

#### People want to Live in This State of Mind Permanently

### A Good Life is Characterized by an Uplifting Mood with Continuous Feelings of Joy and Happiness with Limited Disturbances to This Emotional State

#### The Various Philosophies and Religious or Ethical Systems Really Are about how to Achieve This

#### In Short, the Most Important Skill to Master to Live a Good Life is to Learn how to Manage Your Moods

##### The Philosophy that Comes Closest to Stating This Directly is Buddhist Lamrim and Object Meditation

###### Lamrim Practitioners Try to Purge Their Minds of All Disturbances of Ignorance, Attachment and Aversion

###### The Resulting "pure mind" of a Buddha Exists in a State that Permanently Experiences the "bliss of being"

This is also how the new age philosopher Eckhart Tolle lives

## Daily Life of a Spiritual Warrior

### How Does Spiritual Practice Impact Daily Life?

#### I've Been Experimenting with Spiritual Practices from Many Traditions for More than 30 Years

#### I Evaluate the Results of Practices Based on Their Impact on My Life

##### Does it Impact My Moment-to-moment Experience of Life?

##### Does it Impact My Background Feelings or Subjective Mood?

##### Does it Influence My Behavior and Help Me Make Better Choices?

#### Why Are These Criteria Important?

##### If the Experience of a Practice is Perceived as Negative, It's much Harder to Persist with it

###### Spiritual Practices Don't Need to Be Emotional Masturbation

###### Feeling Good is not an Essential Component

###### If a Practice Does Carry Difficult Emotional Baggage, it Must Have a Strong Secondary Benefit.

##### If a Practice Leaves Me in a Sour Mood, It's Probably not Helping

###### Some Practices Are Disturbing, but in a Positive Cleansing way

Meditating on feeling compassion for your enemies

Taking and giving

Great compassion

##### If a Practice or Belief Prompts Me to Make Poor Decisions

###### I Have no Reason to Keep Practicing

###### It's Clear Evidence that the Practice is not True or Beneficial

#### Difficult Practices with Large Benefits

##### The Reason a Spiritual Practice Must Be Intentionally Cultivated is because it Isn't Natural

##### Many Spiritual Practices Are Emotionally Challenging, and People Would rather not Endure Any Unpleasantness

##### These Techniques Become Practices because People Who Tried Them Realized Some Great Benefit that Was Worth the Effort

#### Seeking a State of Mind

##### Many Spiritual Practitioners Claim that the Best Spiritual Practice is not to Seek Any Particular State of Mind

###### This is Partially True

###### The Goal Isn't to Seek and Sustain Some Mythical Bliss State

###### You Could Take Drugs for that

##### When You Look More Deeply Though, You See that Spiritual Practitioners Are Seeking a way of Being in the World Characterized by Peace of Mind

##### Practices Should Promote Peace of Mind

###### Short Term Disturbance through Emotional Cleansing

###### Long Term Gain of Resistance to Emotional Disturbance

### Peace of Mind, Contentment, Squelching Disturbances

#### Peace of Mind

##### Most People want to Enjoy a State of Mind where They Are not Deeply Disturbed by Events or People

##### A Peaceful Mind is Quiet and Joyful

#### Contentment

##### Ambition and wanting for Things You Don't Have is a Mental Disturbance

##### Most Spiritual Practitioners Do not Obsess over Worldly Concerns

#### Squelching Disturbances

##### You Can't Go through Life Completely Impervious to Reactions to People and Events

##### You Can Work with Spiritual Practices to Lessen the Frequency and Severity of Disturbances, but It's Very Difficult to Completely Eliminate Them

##### The Practice, the Difficult Discipline of Daily Life, is to Apply Opponents to Squelch These Disturbances when the Arise

##### That is the Real Daily Work of a Spiritual Warrior

# The Importance of Mindfulness

## 1. Key Practices of Mindfulness Meditation

### ◦ Observing the Mind, Controlling Its Focus, and Sustaining Concentration Are Fundamental Aspects of Mindful Meditation.

## 2. Common Experience of Focus in Childhood

### ◦ Many People, including Children, Naturally Develop the Ability to Focus for long Periods when Engaged in Activities that Fascinate Them.

### ◦ This Focus Can Be Further Refined and Applied in Mindfulness Meditation.

## 3. Understanding the Mind and Consciousness

### ◦ The Mind Consists of Thoughts, Feelings, Perceptions, Memories, and Overall Cognitive Processes.

### ◦ Most People Are Unaware of how Their Mind Functions as much of it Happens Automatically.

### ◦ Mindfulness Meditation Encourages a Closer Observation of the Mind's Activity.

## 4. Parallel vs. Serial Processing of the Brain

### ◦ The Brain Functions like a Powerful Parallel Processor, Handling Many Thoughts and Feelings Simultaneously, while Consciousness Processes Them Sequentially.

### ◦ Consciousness Filters Emotionally Charged Thoughts and Presents Them as a Continuous Stream of Awareness.

## 5. Initial Challenges in Meditation

### ◦ When Starting Meditation, Many Realize how Chaotic and Active Their Mind Is, Often Likened to a "monkey mind," Constantly Jumping from Thought to Thought.

### ◦ This Restless Mental State Can Be Distracting, but with Practice, Individuals Can Learn to Control Their Mental Focus.

## 6. Controlling Mental Focus

### ◦ Observing the Mind is Important, but Learning to Direct Focus is Essential for Mental Mastery.

### ◦ Beginners Often Focus on Their Breath as a way to Start Meditation, but Distractions Are Common, Leading to Frustration.

### ◦ Perseverance Helps Develop the Ability to Control Focus, and over Time, Meditators Improve Their Concentration.

## 7. Sustaining Focus

### ◦ As Skills Improve, Meditators Can Sustain Attention on a Single Object, like the Breath, for Longer Periods.

### ◦ In a World Full of Distractions, Many Experience Patterns of Inattention, Impulsivity, and Hyperactivity, Making Meditation a Useful Practice to Overcome These Tendencies.

## 8. How to Practice Mindfulness Meditation

### ◦ Mindfulness Meditation Involves Focusing Attention on an Object, Often for a Set Period.

### ◦ The Breath is a Common Focus as it is Always Present and Requires no Special Tools.

### ◦ Another Technique is Body Scanning, Paying Attention to Physical Sensations without Judgment.

### ◦ Some Use Guided Meditation or Mantras to Help Direct Their Focus and Avoid Distractions.

### ◦ Setting a Timer Can Prevent Mental Distractions about when to Stop Meditating.

## 9. Starting with Small Steps

### ◦ Beginners Often Start with Three to Five Minutes of Meditation, Increasing the time as They Become More Comfortable.

### ◦ It's Recommended to Find a Quiet, Comfortable Space, with the Traditional Posture Being Cross-legged with a Straight Back, though Sitting in a Chair or Lying down Are Alternatives.

## 10. Dealing with Wandering Thoughts

### ◦ Minds Naturally Wander during Meditation, even for Experienced Meditators. The Key is to Refocus on the Object of Meditation without Judgment.

### ◦ Consistency in Daily Practice is Essential to seeing Benefits.

## 11. Benefits of Mindfulness Meditation

### ◦ Meditation Helps Cultivate Awareness, Reduce Stress, Improve Concentration, and Promote Overall Well-being.

### ◦ Over Time, it Can Become an Integral part of Daily Life, providing Numerous Mental and Emotional Benefits.

# Meditation to Manage Mood and Emotion

## Emotive Meditation

### Buddhism, Object Meditation

### Christianity, Contemplative Meditation

### New Age, Mindfulness Meditation, Kind of

### It's More than just Watching Your Mind

#### The Practice Demands Focus

#### The Practice Engages Thought

#### You Aren't Trying to Empty the Mind and Purge Thought

### It Isn't just Thinking about Things

#### Emotive Meditation is Extremely Focused

#### You Don't Follow Trains of Thought

#### You Focus on Specific Thoughts and Concepts

#### Although You Can Follow Currents of Feelings

### A Technique for Mental and Emotional Purification

#### The Mind Can Be Purified to Eliminate Suffering

#### Changing the Emotional Weights Assigned to Thoughts

### More Demanding than Mindfulness Mediation

#### Mindfulness Doesn't Attempt to Direct Thought or Feeling

#### Mindfulness Meditation is like a Pre-practice Warm up

#### Mindfulness Strengthens the Capacity for Observation and Focus

### How Emotive Mediation Works

#### Thoughts and Feelings

##### Each Thought Carries Emotional Content

###### Pleasant, Unpleasant, Neutral

###### Weak or Intense

##### The Emotional Content Generates Identifiable Feelings

#### Emotive Mediation Starts with Thought or a Concept to Contemplate

##### Often These Ideas Are Associated with why You want to Do Something, or not Do Something

##### They Contain the "whys" and Benefits of Certain Practices

#### When the Thought Generates a Feeling, the Meditation is to Hold that Feeling as long as Possible

##### If the Feeling is Lost, You return to the Contemplation to Regenerate the Feeling

##### This Can Be Done, Over, and Over, and over Again

#### With Practice, You Can Hold the Feeling and Explore It's Flavors and Variations

##### Flow with Currents of Feelings

##### When Contemplating Reasons for Practices, You Can Remember times when the Reason Proved True

##### Compassion is a Feeling that Mixes Joy and Sadness

##### Feelings of Compassion Differ Based on the Circumstances, providing Flavor

#### Emotive Meditation is like Being Marinated

##### The Feelings Seep into other Thoughts

##### For Example, the Thought "special Needs Children Are Helpless and Endure much Unnecessary suffering" Generates Compassion

###### If It's a Fleeting Thought, it Doesn't Carry much Weight, and It's Unlikely to Change Behavior

###### However, if You Spend a Lot of time Thinking about that Fact and Imagine what Their Lives Are Like, it Will Increase Your Motivation to Do Something to Make Circumstances Better

At least it did for me, or this book wouldn't have been written

#### Most of My Spiritual Practices Are Supported by Emotive Meditation

##### Whenever I Find I Am Disturbed, it return to These Practices to Find Comfort

## Managing Moods and Emotional States through Mental Focus

### Your Thoughts and Feelings Determine Your Mood

#### Consciously, You Are only Aware of One Thought at a time

#### However, Your Mind Thinks Hundreds or Thousands of Thoughts Simultaneously

#### Each of These Thoughts Carries Emotional Content whether or not You Are Conscious of Them

#### The Collective Action of All of These Thoughts is Perceived by You as Mood

#### Happiness is a Mood That's Judged as Positive and Pleasant

#### Therefore, to Be Happy, One Must Cultivate Thoughts with Pleasant Feelings while Purging Those Thoughts that Carry Unpleasant Feelings

##### This Isn't Done through Suppression

##### This Isn't Done through Avoiding Sadness

##### This Isn't Done by Denial, Pretending Unpleasant Feelings Aren't Unpleasant

### Thoughts and Emotions Work together in the Mind

#### Thoughts and Emotions Can Form Feedback Loops

##### Looping Thoughts Serve to Intensify Feelings

##### Increasing Feeling Intensity Serves to Spawn More Thoughts

##### This Can Easily Become a downward Spiral into Non-virtuous Thinking

###### The Fire of Anger and Hatred

###### Eckhart Tolle’s Pain Body Episode

##### With Practice, it Can Become an upward Spiral into Virtuous Thinking

###### Gratitude or Thankfulness Training

#### Thoughts and Emotions Drive All Behavior

##### Cultivating Virtuous States of Mind Leads to Good Behavior

##### Allowing Non-virtuous States of Mind to Take Hold Leads to Bad Behavior

#### Thoughts, Emotions, and Behavior Determine Peace of Mind

##### Training the Mind and Heart Leads to Supreme Happiness

##### You want to Fade out Disturbing Thoughts

##### You want to Cultivate Virtuous Thoughts and Feelings

### How Do You Spend Your Mental and Emotional time and Energy?

#### The time Clock Analogy

##### Many People Work in Jobs where They Punch a time Clock to Register when They Start and Stop Work.

##### They Track the Amount of time They Spend on Specific Tasks or Engaging in Work-related Activities

##### The Same Can Be Done with Mental Focus

###### Whenever You Start Thinking about a Certain Something that Impacts the way You Feel, Imagine Punching a time Clock

###### When You Stop Thinking about that Topic, You Punch out

###### You Can Categorized Each Train of Thought as either Virtuous and Uplifting or Non-virtuous and Disturbing

###### If You Measured the time You Spent on Each Category, what Would it Reveal?

What percentage of your time are you engaged in mental activities that produce virtuous and uplifting thoughts?

What percentage is bringing you down?

An untrained mind will spend 95%-98% of it's time focused on negative, non-virtuous, and disturbing thoughts

This is why most people feel a nagging dissatisfaction with life and endure a lot of suffering

#### Manage Mood through Conscious Mental Focus

##### Focus on Positive, Uplifting, Pleasant Thoughts and Feelings

##### Ignore Negative, Despairing, Unpleasant Thoughts and Feelings

# Disciplines of a Spiritual Warrior

## Apply Emotional Opponents to Restore Peace of Mind

### Reactions that Disturb Your Peace of Mind

#### Whenever You Are Enjoying a Peaceful State of Mind, Events Can and Will Disturb Your Peace

##### Disturbing Events Start Patterns of Thought

##### These Repeating Patterns Are like Trains Leaving a Station

##### Move from One Thought to Another along Well-traveled Tracks

#### It's Easy to Ride a Train of Thought to an Unpleasant Destination

##### Also Known as Going down the Rabbit Hole

##### Trains of Thought Nearly Always Lead to Destinations Replete with Suffering

#### Once You Know where the Path Leads, You Don't Follow it

##### If You Know where a Pattern of Thought Leads

##### And You Know it Leads to Negative Feelings and Suffering

##### You Don't Board the Train

##### Or You Get off at the First Possible Moment

##### Following a Negative Train of Thought is Foolish and Destructive

#### Geshe Ben Gungyal

##### Geshe Kelsang Gyatso Relays the Story of Geshe Ben Gungyal in "how to Understand the mind"

##### Ben Gungyal Did not Meditate nor Recite Prayers as part of His Practice

###### His Story Illustrates that a Formal Meditation Practice or Prayer Ritual is not Essential to Having a Powerful and Vibrant Spiritual Life

Helpful, yes; essential, no

##### His only Practice Was to Watch His Mind Very Closely

###### Whenever a Delusion Arose

He increased his alertness

He immediately applied the proper opponent for that delusion

##### This Left in Peace Most of the time

###### Over time the Delusions Arose less Often

### Apply Emotional Opponents Immediately

#### Mind the Gap

##### There is a Gap in time between Boarding the Train and Realizing You're on it

##### The Longer the Time, the Faster the Train Moves, and the More Difficult it is to Get off

##### Catch it at the Earliest Possible Moment and Disembark

#### Positive Opponents Will Restore Peace of Mind

##### Each of the Negative Reactions Has an Opponent

##### Opponents Are Specific Thoughts and Concepts with an Emotional Power that Cancels out the Negative Reaction

##### Countering with Opponents Are the Swords and Shields of Inner Emotional Combat

###### The Combat Reference Does not Imply a Loss of Peace of Mind

###### The Opponent Force Restores Order, like Law Enforcement

##### Meditating on These Opponents Makes Them Readily Available to Deploy when Needed

#### This Technique Requires a Reflex Understanding of Spiritual Opponents

##### Memorize the Opponents

##### Contemplate Their Meaning

##### Link the Emotions of an Arising Delusion with the Opponent

##### Always Watch Your Mind and React Accordingly

### Apply Opponents with Ruthless Discipline

#### The Combat Analogy is Apt

#### Delusions Are not to Be Shown Any Mercy

#### Buddhist Art Depicts Demons and Gods with Weapons

#### It is not Internal Strife to Battle and Defeat the Delusions that Upset Your Peace of Mind

#### It Becomes a Habit and Develops into Character

### The Weedy Tree of Mental Disturbance

#### Tree Has a Deep Root, Think Trunks, Many Branches, and Poisonous Fruit

##### You Can Work to Remove the Weed at Any Level

##### Mental Disturbance is the Poisonous Fruit of the Weed of Delusion Planted in Your Mind

#### Ignorance, the Root of All Mental Disturbance

##### Root of All other Delusions and Sources of Suffering

##### Selfishness

##### Certainty of Judgment, Cherishing Opinions

##### Embarrassment, Self-debasement, or Self-importance

##### Buddhist Enlightenment is about Uprooting the Tree

###### If the Root Disappears, the Tree Dies, and the Poisonous Fruit Does not Ripen

#### Twin Trunks of Attachment and Aversion

##### Clutching onto or Pushing away

##### Attachment and Desire

##### Anger and Aversion

##### Meditations on Overcoming Aversion and Attachment also Weaken or Destroy the Branches

##### Branches of Attachment and Desire

##### Despair

##### Jealousy

##### Greed

#### Branches of Anger and Aversion

##### Resentment

##### Vengefulness

##### Hatred

## Selecting a Primary Spiritual Practice

### Address the Disturbance You Find Most Troubling

#### Any of the Practices Described here Could Be a Primary Training

#### People Who Struggle with Anger Find Acceptance is a More Helpful Primary Training

#### People Who Avoid Sadness or Hold Grudges Find Compassion a Helpful Primary Training

#### People Who Endure Highs and Lows from Their Attachments Should Focus on Impermanence and Death

#### People Who Succumb to Jealousy and Rarely Feel Joy Should Work with Rejoicing as a Primary

### Your Primary Practice May Change as Your Grow and Develop

#### You Don't Necessarily Need a Primary Training

##### Ben Franklin's 13 Virtues

###### Each Day He Focused on a Different virtue

###### Similarly, You Could Focus on a Different Training Each Day

#### I Have Engaged in Several Primary Practices, Often for Months or Years on End

#### For Many Years, I Focused on Being Present to Reduce Worry

##### When I Realized This Was part of Managing My Focus toward Gratitude, the Training Morphed and Grew to what I Practice Today

#### For Many Months, I’ve Focused on Lovingkindness as an Extension of Gratitude Training Expressed Outwardly in the World

#### For Many Months, My Primary Practice Focused on the Death Meditation, Recognizing Impermanence, and Reducing My Attachments

##### Out of This Period, by Life's Priorities and Activities Completely Changed

#### For Many Months, My Primary Practice Was Focusing on Abandoning Thoughts about Myself

##### Buddhist Emptiness Training

##### I Still Focus on This Periodically

##### At This Point, I Use it Mostly as an Opponent when Self-important Thoughts Arise

#### I've also Spent Extended Periods without a Primary Practice instead Focusing on Deepening My Understanding of Opponents and Sharpening Their Use

#### I've also Spent much time in a Sequential Practice of Meditations Known as Lamrim

##### Lamrim is a Sequence of Meditations Designed to Take You Step-by-step toward Enlightenment

# Gratitude and Thankfulness Practice

## Quote

## At the time of This Writing, My Primary Practice is to Focus My Thoughts on Feelings of Thankfulness for My Blessings and Enjoyments

### Specific Practice, Intentionally Chosen

### I Find it Helpful to Have a Primary Practice to Combat My Most Difficult Emotional Habits

#### I Find Gratitude Training Helpful as I Am Prone to Dismiss Joy and instead Focus on lack

##### A Common Bad Habit among All People

##### The Mind Will Naturally Focus on what it Doesn't Have and Believes it Wants if Left Untrained and Undisciplined

#### If I Am not Watching My Mind and Engaging in This Practice, My Mood Sours over Time, and I Am Prone to More Disturbances

### I Still Watch My Mind Constantly and Apply the Opponents Described in This Work when Needed

#### But Applying Opponents is Reactionary and not Necessary at All times

#### For Me, a Primary Practice is Something I Engage in 24/7

##### Eventually it Becomes Habituated and no Longer Requires Intense Focus and Mental Discipline

###### I Went through that Cycle with the Practice of Exchanging Myself with My Special Needs Son

###### After Engaging in the Practice Consciously for Many Months,

I no longer needed to remind myself of its importance

I just did it all the time

## What is Gratitude Training?

### Https://www.templeton.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jtf-hope-optimism.pdf

### Be Thankful for whatever You Have

#### Even in the Worst of Circumstances, You Can Find Ways to Interpret the Events as Good

##### I Cried because I Have no Shoes until I Saw a Man with no Feet

##### It Doesn't Negate or Deny the Negative or Undesirable Qualities of whatever Happened

###### It Merely Focuses Attention and thereby the Emotion on Something Positive and Uplifting

###### Your Thoughts Determine Your Feelings, and Your Feelings Control Your Moods

#### Finding the Positive, no Matter how Small, is a Mental Discipline

##### If You Engage in the Practice, Your Mood Will Improve, and You Will Be Happier

##### It Isn't just Positive Thinking

###### You Can Lose Yourself in Delusion and Fantasy

###### It's an Interpretation of Reality, Based on Fact

### Cultivate an Optimistic Disposition

#### Intentionally Cultivate a Belief that Events Will Turn out in Ways the Promote Your Happiness and well Being

##### Glass Half Full

##### Since This is an Interpretation of Events, not an Objective Evaluation, It's Possible to Achieve

##### Even if Things Occur that You Don't want to Occur, You Can Learn to Suspend Judgment and Look for What's Positive

##### This Entire Work is about Convincing You that Your Special Needs Child is a Blessing and not a Curse

#### Optimism is Natural, Pessimism is Learned

##### People Are Naturally Optimistic

##### However, since People also Naturally Focus on lack and Negative Outcomes, Their Natural Optimism is Subdued

###### Optimism is Overridden by Frequent Negative Interpretations of Events

###### Overtime Optimism Fades and Pessimism Takes over

Some mistakenly call this wisdom that comes from experience

It's not wisdom

It's ignorance born of undisciplined negative interpretations

## Gratitude Overcomes Dissatisfaction

### Gratitude is also an Emotional Opponent

#### Am Emotional Opponent is a Mental Discipline You Engage in whenever Some Event Disturbs Your Peace of Mind

#### Gratitude Training is Different because It's not Intended to Overcome Some Specific Disturbing Occurrence

#### I Practice Gratitude as a Primary because I’m Trying to Overcome the Overall Malaise of Unsatisfactoriness of Daily Life

##### The Buddha's Teaching Are Often Described as Overcoming Suffering

###### However, that Isn't Completely Accurate

###### Overcoming Overt Suffering and Pain Was part of the Buddha's Teaching, but what He Was Describing Was More Subtle and Nuanced than that

##### The Buddha Noticed that Life Experience Becomes Imbued with a Permanent Sense of Dissatisfaction

###### It Isn't Necessarily Overtly Painful or Intense Suffering

###### It's a General Mood or Sense that Life Isn't All that Great

###### In Short, Life is Boring and All Experiences Become Unsatisfying, even Intensely Pleasurable Ones

##### The Buddha Realized This Unsatisfactoriness Was Rooted in Our Sense of Self, Our Endless Desire, and Our Endless quest to Find Momentary Satisfaction

##### I Practice Gratitude as an Opponent to the Feelings of Unsatisfactoriness of Daily Life

## The Hamster Wheel of Endless Problem Solving

### Address "problems" only on an As-needed Basis

#### Focus on the Present rather than Worry about the Future

##### Eckhart Tolle’s Power of now Addresses This Key Feature of the Mind of Worry

##### As Eckhart Tolle is Fond of Asking "what Problem Do You Have at This moment?"

###### The Answer is Nearly Always "none"

I'm only imagining future problems I may have to deal with at some point

###### Committing to Solving Problems only on an "as needed" Basis Eliminates a Lot of Worry

#### It Isn't Desirable or Practical to Eliminate All Thoughts of the Future

##### All Complex Tasks Require Future Thinking and Planning

##### You Need to Plan for Retirement

##### You Need to Exercise for Future Health

##### Setting aside time to Address Future Events is Necessary and Desirable

##### However, You Should Minimize the time and Effort to Deal with Those Events and Circumstances that Are not Immediate and not what I want

#### Ignore Negative Judgments when not Immediately Useful for Decision Making

### Endless Focus on Problems is not the "red queen" Effect

#### You Don't Need to Burn Endless Energy on Solving Perceived Problems just to Stay where You Are

### Once You Realize You Are on a Hamster Wheel Expending Effort while Making no Progress, the only Rational Choice is to Get off

### It Takes Some Faith to Stop Focusing on All Your Problems All the time

#### People Worry that if They Don't Obsess on Problems, They Won't Solve Them

#### Or They Will Make a Poor Decision because They Haven't Thought Everything through

### A Certain Amount of Rumination is Necessary

#### But it is Consistently Overdone by a Large Factor

#### This Becomes a Rationalization for Wasted time and Energy

## Engage in Gratitude Practice whenever the Mind is not Needed for Some other Activity

### When You Are Alone with Your Thoughts, Focus on Gratitude

### In place of Mindless Entertainment, Focus on Gratitude

#### Or at Least Spend a Moment Being Grateful for the Opportunity to Enjoy Mindless Entertainment

### Ask Yourself "what Wonderful New Things Will I Experience today?"

#### Questions like This Set Your Mental Radar to Look for Items to Be Thankful for even when Your Conscious Mind is Engaged in other Activities

### I Found Gratitude Practice a Great Replacement for Extraneous Thoughts about Myself

#### I Used to Focus Exclusively on My Own Life Circumstances and Perceived Problems

##### Losing Sleep over Circumstances

##### Worrying about Potential Outcomes

##### Me, Me, Me

#### I Never Actually Solved Many Problems that Way, but that Didn't Stop Me from Trying

#### Even if My Focus Changed My Life Circumstances for the Better, I Simply Replaced the Old Problem with a New One

## Gratitude Training Fosters a Peaceful State of Mind and a Happy Mood

### If You Think about what Brings You Joy and Happiness, that Becomes Your Experience of Daily Life

### With Continuing Practice, the Happiness Resulting from a Focus on Gratitude Becomes the Dominant State of Mind

### Once Happiness Becomes the Norm, that State is Maintained by Applying Opponents when Something Disturbs Your Peace

# Selflessness Opposes Pride

## Your Self-importance is the Cause of All Your Emotional Problems

### You Probably Hold All of the following Incorrect Beliefs

#### You Believe Meeting Your Own Needs and Wants is Paramount

#### Whenever Your Needs and Wants Are in Conflict with Another's Needs and Wants, Yours Should Take Precedence because You Are More Important than They Are

#### You Believe that Placating Your Selfish Desires is the Greatest Good

#### You Believe that Satisfying Your Selfish Desires Justifies whatever You Do

### Any Bad Thing You've Ever Done Was Motivated by Selfish Desire

#### Whenever You Hurt Others, You Were Acting on Your Selfish Desire

#### Most Negative Consequences You've Endured where in Response to Your Behavior Motivated by Selfish Desire

##### Everyone in Prison Today is there because They Acted on Their Selfish Desire

### All Unhappiness Comes from the Desire to Make Yourself Happy

### The More You Can Diminish Your Self Importance, the More Peaceful You Will Be

## Most People Don't Recognize that Thinking about Themselves is a Problem

### It's so Common and so Natural, People Assume It's Necessary

### The Negative Impact is Obvious to Those with a Lot of Negative Self Talk

#### But They Generally Don't Know how to Stop

#### Because They Think These Thoughts Are Important

#### If They Recognized that Negative Self Talk as Meaningless Drivel, Which it Is, it Would Fade away in time

### The Negative Impact is less Obvious to Those Struggling with Self Aggrandizement

#### But it is no less Distracting and Disturbing to Peace of Mind

#### Pride, Narcissism and Self-flattery Are not Beneficial Traits

## Low Self Esteem Diminishes when You Abandon Self Importance

### Low Self-esteem is Rampant in the Western World

#### We Judge Ourselves Based on Perfect Images and Unrealistic Expectations

##### We Are Aren't Good Enough

##### We Are Losers in a Competitive Society

#### We Succumb to Jealous Denigrations Heaped on Us by Others

### Low Self-esteem Accepts and Reinforces a Negative Narrative

#### Others Are Often Motivated by Anger and Jealousy to Say Terrible, Hurtful Things

#### We Internalize Negative Statements of Parents, Siblings, Friends, Acquaintances, and Enemies

#### Once We Start to Identify with These Statements, Our Self Esteem Drops until it Becomes Self Loathing

### Perils of Low Self Esteem and Self Loathing

#### Intense Mental Disturbance

#### Suffering and Unhappiness

#### Leads to Jealousy

#### Anger at Self and Others

#### Bad Behavior from Anger and Jealousy

### Thinking about Yourself is the Root of Nearly All Mental Disturbance

#### The Primary Defense against Low Self Esteem is not to Form Opinions about Yourself to Begin with or Give Those Opinions Any Weight

##### Practice Non-judgment about Your Self to a point

#### Thinking about Yourself is Largely Unnecessary

#### The Concepts and Beliefs about Yourself, Positive or Negative, Are just Thoughts in Your Head

##### They Are not Real

##### They Have no Substance

##### It Doesn't Matter how Many Agree with the Assessment

##### Getting other People to Agree with Your Opinions Gives Them no Extra Reality

###### But People Still Expend Tremendous Effort and Resources Ostensibly to Convince Others They Are a Good Person

##### Many People's Idea of a Support Person is Someone Who Confirms Their Delusions

###### How Many of Your Friends Are Your Friends because They Patiently Listen to Your Self-talk and Confirm Your Self-delusions?

Returning the favor isn't really doing them any favors

If your friendships are based on a mutual support of personal delusions, it's a weak foundation

### Eliminating Thoughts about Yourself Greatly Quiets Your Mind

#### 80%+ Of Your Thinking is about Yourself

#### This is the "peace dividend" of Mental Training

## Low Self Esteem Disappears with Moral Discipline

### Abandoning Self-importance Reduces Esteem Problems, but Moral Discipline Will Completely Correct it

### Not All Self Opinions Are Bad or counter Productive

#### You Don't Need to Make an Identity Judgment to Evaluate the Effects of Your Actions

##### Skillful or Unskillful Choices Do not Make You a Good or Bad Person

#### If You Didn't Evaluate Your Own Behavior, You Would Engage in Destructive Non-virtuous Actions without Remorse

#### Healthy Regrets Formed by Negative Judgments about prior Actions is a Useful Self Judgment

#### Low Self Esteem Can Serve as a Necessary Motivation for Change

### Low Self Esteem May Be Warranted due to lack of Moral Discipline

#### If You Engage in Bad Behavior, You Should Feel Bad about Your Actions

#### What You Do to other People Matters

#### Non-virtuous Behavior

##### These Are Easy to Understand Rules

##### Non-virtuous Behavior is Any Activity that Leads to Suffering for Yourself or Others

###### Most People when Engaging in a Non-virtuous Activity Believe that it Will Bring Them Pleasure or Happiness

They also don't consider or care about any negative impact on others

##### Hurting People, Lying, Cheating, Stealing, Manipulating and Exploiting Others for Personal Gain

##### Acting from Anger or Hate, Holding Grudges, Retaliating for Grievances, Wishing to Harm Others

##### Pretending You Don't Have Faults, or Pretending You Possess Virtuous Traits You Actually lack

##### Denying Your Bad Behavior when it Occurs and Deceiving Others about it

##### Feeling Self-satisfaction for Wealth, Status, Knowledge, Beauty, Skill, or Any Attribute You Deem Superior to Others, including Your Spiritual Development

##### Putting Your Needs and Wants over other People through Inconsideration

##### Maintaining a Willful Ignorance to the Difference between virtue and Non-virtue

##### Engaging in Any Non-virtuous Activity with no Remorse or Regret for the Harm You Cause

##### If You Engage in Non-virtuous Behavior, You Should Have Low Self Esteem

###### Because that Makes You an Asshole

###### Rationalizing Bad Behavior Doesn't Make it less Bad

### Low Self Esteem Based on Immoral Behavior Disappears when You Commit to Moral Disciplines

#### In Short, Don't Be an Asshole and You Won't Feel like One

#### Golden Rule

##### Do onto Others as You Would Have Others Do onto You

##### Always Good Advice

##### Simple to Understand and Practice

##### Root of the Practice of Exchanging Self with Others

#### 10 Commandments

##### Timeless Wisdom Rooted in the Golden Rule

##### Most Religious Traditions of Rules to Facilitate Harmonious Group Conduct

###### Pay Attention to Feelings of Remorse and Regret

##### Don't place Your Self Interest above Another's

#### Discipline of Helping Others

## Healthy Shame versus Pretense

### Giving Weight to Your Self Judgments Wastes a Lot of Time, Energy, Money, and Disturbs Your Peace of Mind

#### The More You Cherish Your Self Opinion, the More Time, Money, and Effort You Will invest/waste in Supporting it

##### Pretense is an Attempt to Influence other Peoples Thoughts and Opinions

##### Designer Clothing, Luxury Cars, Exclusive Communities, Mostly It's about Shoring up what You Believe Someone Else Thinks about You

###### Trying to Influence other People's Opinions is the Biggest Waste of Resources of All

You can't control what others think

Even if you could, it doesn't change you in any way

##### And since Your Self-opinion an Illusion, Supporting it is a Complete Waste

### Healthy Shame is the Root of Helpful Regret

#### It Isn't that You Should not Care at All about what other People Think

#### You Should Care about the Mental and Emotional Harm You Cause other People

#### Motivated by Self-importance You Act in Ways that Harms Others

#### Recognizing This Harmful Behavior Requires Judgment

#### Judging Your Own Behavior Harmful, You Develop a Healthy Regret

### Meditating on the Healthy Regret Prevents You from Harming Others Again

#### Give it Enough Attention to Serve as Motivation not to Do it Again

#### Don't Dwell on it and Identify as a Bad Person because of what You Did

##### Making it part of Your Identity Will Drive You to Do it Again

##### Focusing Too much Attention on Regrets is Depressing

##### Accept what You Did, Make Apologies if Helpful, and Stop Thinking about it

##### To Focus Undue Attention on it is Another. Form of Self-importance

## The "self" You Imagine and Fiercely Cling to is not a Thing

### Buddhist Traditions Teach that the Self Doesn't Exist Intrinsically, like Physical Objects. The Self is an Illusion Created by Mind.

### You Are an Activity

#### Other than the Activity of Mind, You Are Nothing at All

### You're not Likely to Believe or Accept what I’ve Stated

#### Your Mind is Throwing up Thousands of Angry Objections

##### You're Real and Substantial

##### You Have an Immutable Soul

##### You Will Exist Forever

#### I’m Assaulting One of Your Most Cherished Delusions

#### I Ask You to Suspend Your Disbelief

#### Let's Take a Deeper Dive into Your Sense of Self and See if You Find Any Real Substance or Reality there

### What Are You?

#### Neuroscientists Can Find no Source of the Self

##### There is no Single Location within the Body and Brain where the Self Resides

###### The Pineal Gland is not the Seat of the Soul

Rene Descartes imagined it as the seat of the inner theater

It merely secretes melatonin

###### Mental Activity Spreads across the Brain with no Consistent or Central Location

###### Brain Plasticity Shows that the Brain Can Move and Regenerate Certain Functions when Damaged

#### The Self is like the English Grammar Concept of a Gerund

##### A Verb Put into Service as a Noun

##### An Activity that is Perceived as an Object

##### A Process of "selfing". It's like the English Linguistic Concept of a Gerund, a Verb Pressed into Service as a Noun. If I Say "walking is fun." I Made the Verb "walk" into a Noun "walking". Similarly, I Can Take the Mental Activity of "selfing" and Turn it into a Noun, "self". We Do it so Instinctively that We Don't Realize that Thing We Created out of an Activity Isn't Real or Physical. It's a Mental Activity Masquerading as a Real Thing.

#### First, Some Buddhist Traditions Don't Teach that the Self Doesn't Exist. The Teaching is that the Self Doesn't Exist Intrinsically, like Physical Objects. The Self is an Illusion Created by Mind. The Self is Actually the Perception of a Mental Process. We Bring the Self into Existence Moment-by-moment in a Process of "selfing". It's like the English Linguistic Concept of a Gerund, a Verb Pressed into Service as a Noun. If I Say "walking is fun." I Made the Verb "walk" into a Noun "walking". Similarly, I Can Take the Mental Activity of "selfing" and Turn it into a Noun, "self". We Do it so Instinctively that We Don't Realize that Thing We Created out of an Activity Isn't Real or Physical. It's a Mental Activity Masquerading as a Real Thing. We even Concoct Words to Hold This Thing, Most Notably the Idea of "soul." the Self is an Illusion Created by Mental Processes and the Persistence of Memory. It Has no Existence beyond That, Which means it Doesn't Exist Intrinsically.

## "just Be yourself" is Useless Advice

### The Intention of the Advice is not to Pretend to Be Some Character

#### It Leads to Feelings of Falseness and Insincerity

#### People Believe They Are not Expressing Their True Desires

##### They Mistakenly Believe there is Some "true" Self that Has True Desires

### Some Cultures Actually Encourage People to Be a Polished Persona, an Actor in Their Own Play

#### Confucius Advised People to Strive to Be Their Best Self

#### Deciding to Emulate Certain Character Traits is Considered Good Manners

### The More Basic Problem is that there is no "yourself"

#### There is no One Authentic You

#### You Are a Collection of Competing Desires That's Constantly in Flux

#### Through Emotive Meditation You Can Change the Strengths of These Competing Desires

#### You Can Change Your Decisions by Modifying What's Important to You

#### You Can Change Your Moods and Influence how You Feel Day to Day

#### But there is no Underlying "you" that Serves as an Authentic Self for You to just Be

## Practice Humility to Diminish Pride

### Pride is an Inflated Opinion of Yourself

#### Many People with Low Self Esteem Cross over into the other Spiritual Ditch and Cultivate Pride

##### The Reasoning Being that You Should Find Things to Feel Good about Yourself

###### You Should Focus on Things You Are Thankful for

###### You Can Focus on Positive and Uplifting Aspects of Your Life Circumstances

##### You Should not Focus on Any Aspect of what You Perceive as Yourself, Good or Bad

###### You Should Abandon Self Identifications, not Seek to Enhance Them

###### An Inflated Opinion of Yourself is as Problematic as a Negative One

### People Can Develop Pride over Almost Anything

#### People Experience Pride over Youth, Beauty, Strength, Athletics, Intelligence, Wealth, Power, Any Worldly Concern

#### Even if Someone Has Nothing, They Can Take Pride in Their Victimhood

#### Pride over Inferiors

##### Pride We Feel when We Judge Others to Be Inferior to Us in Some respect

##### Even if We Have Greater Skills or Accomplishments, it Accomplishes Nothing to Develop Pride over that Fact

#### Pride over Equals

##### This is a False Pride that Feels We Are Superior to Someone when We Are not

#### Pride over Superiors

##### Pride over Superiors is when We Feel We Are Better than Someone with Great Skill or Accomplishment

##### Pride over Superiors is Based on Delusion because We Feel Superior for Traits and Qualities We only Imagine We Have or Believe We Have Based on Incorrect Information

##### This is both Delusional and Prideful

##### The Object of Our Pride is Often Someone Who also Exhibits Pride

##### The Basis of All "talking smack" in Sports

##### The Source of Drama and Entertainment on Reality Tv

#### People Take Pride in Identifications with Groups, Separating Themselves from Others and Judging that They Are Superior

#### People Take Pride in Non-virtuous Behavior, like Being a Good Thief

#### People Develop Pride over Their Superior Spiritual Development, a Self-negating Idea

#### Any time You Are Feeling Superior to Another Human Being, You Are Feeling Pride

### Problems with Cultivating Pride

#### People with an Attitude of Self-importance Become Arrogant and Impervious to Learning New Things

#### Prideful People Suffer as Others Do not Share the Same Lofty Opinion of Themselves

#### Prideful People Don't Feel as if They Obtain the respect They Deserve for Their Superiority

#### Prideful People Are Easily Offended, Particularly when Others point out Their Obvious Faults or More Realistic Attributes

#### Prideful People Waste Time, Money and Effort in a Vain Attempt Convincing Others that They Are in Fact Superior

#### Nobody Enjoys Being Made to Feel Inferior, so Prideful People Are Appreciated by no One

#### Pride is a Barrier to Meaningful Relationships

#### Pride is Ultimately Self Defeating because Believing You Are Superior to Another is Proof that You Are not

### Cultivating a Mind of Humility is the Opponent to Pride

#### Remember the Many Problems with Pride

#### Remind Yourself that You Are Superior to no One

#### Ignore Thoughts Supporting Feelings of Superiority

## How to Diminish Self-importance

### Deepen Your Understanding that the Self is an Illusion

#### Whenever the Sense of Self Arises Strongly

#### Immediately Remind Yourself It's Merely a Figment of Your Imagination

#### The Self is an Activity that Believes It's a Thing

#### The Self is Merely a Collection of Ideas and Thoughts in Your Head

### Diminish the Importance of the Messages concerning Your Self

#### Laugh at the Silliness of the Statements

##### This Was a Specific Technique I Used to Stop the Self Aggrandizement Talk

###### I Am far Too Familiar with the Problems of Pride.

##### I Spent Weeks Giggling to Myself over the Ridiculousness of the Things I Said to Myself

#### Ignore the Chatter as Meaningless Drivel

##### Because it is

##### Good or Bad, It's not Accurate or Important

#### You Are None of the Opinions You Hold about You or that Others Hold about You

##### Most People Give far Too much Weight to what They Imagine Others Think about Them

##### Mostly, other People Don't Think about You as They Are Too Busy Thinking about Themselves

###### When I Was 20 I Worried about what Others Thought about Me

###### When I Was 40, I Didn't Care what Others Thought about Me

###### When I Was 60, I Realized They Were Never Thinking about Me Anyway

##### Other People's Opinions Are Irrelevant

###### These Opinions May Have Consequence if It's Someone You Interact with Frequently

###### But These Opinions Don't Define Who and what You Are

###### You Are under no Obligation to Accept Someone Else's Opinion about You

#### Over time the Self Talk Will Dissipate

##### Once Recognized, the Practice is to Ignore Self Talk until it Fades away

##### And it Does Fade away if You Stop Listening and Reacting to it

##### You Will not Miss it

##### It Has no Value

# Non-judgment Opposes Righteous Judgment

## Object Discernment versus Value Judgments

### One of the Primary Purposes of Mind and Consciousness is to Make Discernments

#### Is there Danger to Be Avoided

#### Are there Resources to Be Obtained

#### Making Proper Discernments is Key to Survival

#### It Isn't Possible or Desirable to Stop Making Discernments Altogether

### Once We Discern what an Object Is, We Make a Judgment as to whether It's Good or Bad, Desirable or Undesirable

#### These Judgments Are Often in Error

#### The More Complex the Situation, the More Prone We Are to Making Mistakes

#### All Wisdom Teachings in All Moral, Ethical, and Religious Systems is about Improving Judgment and Making Better Choices

#### The Basis of All Wisdom is the Recognition that You Could Be Mistaken

## Unwarranted Confidence in the Quality of Our Judgments

### One of Our Strongest Opinions about Ourselves is Our Confidence, or lack Thereof, in Our Judgments and Decision Making

### We Develop a Certitude in the Correctness of Our Judgments Based on Our Experience

### We Work to Convince Others of Our Superior Judgment and Revel in Our Righteousness

### We Gain an Unfounded Arrogance or an Unwarranted Incompetence

#### We Usually Error to the Side of Arrogant Certainty

#### Dunning Kruger Effect

### For Most People, the only Thing that Exceeds Their Arrogance is Their Ignorance

## Our Judgments Are a Primary Source of Mental Disturbance

### Most of Our Mental Disturbances Stem from Our Judgements about People's Motivations or the Outcome of Events

### We Develop Strong Attachments to People Who Please Us

### We Develop Strong Aversions and Hatreds to People Who Displease Us

### We Form Attachments and Aversions to Outcomes of Events

#### Did You Favorite Sports Team Win or Lose?

#### Did Your Favorite Political Candidate Win or Lose?

#### Some People even Develop Strong Responses to Changes in the Weather

### All These Attachments and Aversions Are Sources of Mental Disturbance and Suffering

## There Are Viable Techniques for Reducing Mental Disturbance

### Mental Disturbance Can Be Conceptually Quantified

### Mental Disturbance Equals Importance times Certainty

#### The Degree of Our Disturbance Depends Entirely on the Importance We place on These People or Events and the Certainty of Our Judgments

#### If We Consider a Specific Event Outcome or Another Person's Conforming Behavior Important, it Creates Potential for Disturbance when Things Don't Go Our way

### To Reduce the Disturbance, You Can Reduce either Importance or Certainty

#### Reducing Certainty Involves Countering Judgment with the Wisdom of Non-judgment

#### Reducing Importance Involves Countering Attachment with Impermanence

### It's a Sound Spiritual Practice to Reduce both Certainty and Importance

## Why Should You Engage in the Practice of Non-judgment?

### Extreme Highs and Lows Are Bad for My Emotional Health and Disturb Your Peace of Mind

#### And Mostly, You Will Endure the Extreme Lows

### Your Premature Judgments of Good or Bad Often Motivate You to Make Bad Decisions

### Your Negative Judgments about People Often Cause Problems in Your Relationships

### Eroding the Certainty in Our Negative Judgments Relieves Stress and Suffering

#### My Conviction that Something Was Wrong with My Son Was the Cause of Enormous Unnecessary Suffering

#### Learning not to Make the Judgment Eliminates the Suffering Entirely

## How Do You Stop Making Judgments?

### Recognize that the Euphoric Highs and Depressing Lows Are Caused by the Certainty of My Judgments about the Matter

### Recognize that All Your Judgments of Good and Bad Outcomes May Be Mistaken

### Zen Story of the Farmer

#### Once upon the time there Was an Old Farmer Who Had Worked His Crops for Many Years. One Day His Horse Ran Away. Upon Hearing the News, His Neighbors Came to Visit. "such Bad luck," They Said Sympathetically.

#### "maybe," The Farmer Replied.

#### The next Morning the Horse Returned, Bringing with it Three other Wild Horses. "how wonderful," the Neighbors Exclaimed.

#### "maybe," Replied the Old Man.

#### The following Day, His Son Tried to Ride One of the Untamed Horses, Was Thrown, and Broke His Leg. The Neighbors Again Came to Offer Their Sympathy on His Misfortune.

#### "maybe," Answered the Farmer.

#### The Day After, Military Officials Came to the Village to Draft Young Men into the Army. Seeing that the Son's Leg Was Broken, They Passed Him By. The Neighbors Congratulated the Farmer on how well Things Had Turned Out.

#### "maybe," Said the Farmer.

#### Explanation: the Farmer Understands the True Nature of Life, that You Can't Judge Any Event as an "end" in a Way. There Aren't Definite Breaks that Separate One Moment versus Another, and there Isn't a Perfectly Formulated End Which Everything Builds To.

#### There's Always Tomorrow. And whether the Day Was Good or Bad, There's a Million Effects Which Can Arise from One Event. Good and Bad Are Interconnected. They Are, in Fact, Two Sides of the Same Coin. If Things Seem Perfect, They Aren't. Things Can Change in an Instant, at All Times. And They Will at Some point or Another.

### Whenever I Am Certain that Something that Happens is Bad, I May Find Something Good Comes from it

### Whenever I Am Certain that Something that Happens is Good, I May Find that it Causes Problems.

### A Man Directly Responsible for 345 Premeditated Murders

#### Suppose I Told You that a Single Person Shot and Killed over 300 People

##### Would You Judge that He is Bad?

#### This Person Was a Sniper in World War Ii Serving His Country

##### Would You Judge that He is Good?

#### This Man, Matthäus Hetzenauer, Was German, the Losing Side Responsible for the Holocaust

##### Would You Judge that He is Bad?

#### What if He Was not Aware of the Holocaust (many Germans weren't)?

##### Would You Judge that He is Good?

#### We Rarely Have All the Facts, and We Seldom Know what Motivated People to Do what They Did

##### And even if You Had All the Facts, Are You Really Comfortable Pronouncing Righteous Judgment on Others Weighing out All the Extenuating Circumstances?

#### Given These Facts, how Can You Be Certain about Your Judgements of Good or Bad in other People?

### It is Wiser to Suspend Your Judgment about People or Events due to Incomplete Information

### Once You Internalize the Problems with Making Judgments, You Will Make Them less Often

### When You Do Make Judgments, You Will counter Them with the Recognition that You Could Be Mistaken, Reducing Your Certainty

## The Results of Many Years Practice is Positive

### I Have Been Practicing This for Many Years

#### I Would not Recommend the Practice if it Were not a Proven Winner

### The Practice of Non-judgment Has not Diminished My Ability to Make Important Distinctions and Discernments, and I Have Lost no Well-founded Confidence in My Decisions

### I Have Lost Foolish Confidence in Areas where I Am not an Expert

### I Have Become More Deliberate with My Decision Making because I Stop to Question the Basis for My Important Decisions

#### I Think that Has Been a Helpful

#### I Feel that Questioning My Judgments Has Increased My Wisdom

# Impermanence Opposes Attachment

## Quote

## We All Form Attachments

### Whenever You Obtain a Resource You Feel is Important, whether This Be a Person, place or Thing, Your Naturally Don't want to Lose it

### Parting is not Sweet Sorrow

### Losing Something You Value is Painful

#### Digesting This Loss Requires Enduring Sadness

#### Resisting the Loss Makes it Worse and Leads to Suffering

### The Sting of Attachment Comes in other Forms as well

#### Sometimes You Obtain Things You Didn't Want, like an Illness

#### Sometimes You Fail to Obtain the Thing at All, Creating Disappointment

### The Most Common Reaction to Loss is Anger, Resisting what Is, and Avoiding Accepting Reality

## How to Avoid Forming Attachment

### There Are Two Primary Methods of Successfully Addressing Attachment

#### Avoid Forming the Attachment in the First Instance

#### Reducing the Suffering of Broken Attachment through Acceptance and Sadness

#### Neither One is Easy

### Meditating on Death and the Facts Surrounding Death is the Cornerstone of Addressing Attachment

### In Addition, it Serves to Motivate You to Focus on What's Really Important rather than Wasting Effort on Worldly Concerns

#### I Meditate on Death Often, and for a Time, it Was a Primary Practice

#### Meditation on Death Changed My Life

##### I Devote My time and Energy to My Son because of the Death Meditation

##### I Stopped Pursuing Extraneous Worldly Concerns that Were Largely Motivated by the Desire to Make More Money and Consume More

##### I Stopped Chasing Fame, Fortune, or Status of Any Kind

###### I Still provide for My Family, but I Do it for Them, not for Me

##### I Learned a Key Lesson about Impermanence, Which Helps Me with My Attachments

## You Are Going to Die

### Mostly, We Go through Life Seeking Objects of Our Desire, Laboring under the False Idea that Happiness Can Be Found in Wealth, Status, or a Good Reputation. We Expend Tremendous Amounts of Energy toward Obtaining Things and Attaching Ourselves to Them, only to Find Disappointment when These Things Don't Bring Us the Happiness We Desire.

### You've Heard the Expression, "you Can't Take it with you." and We All Intellectually Know that to Be True, but Do We Really Live Our Lives as if it Were True?

### Consider the following Story:

#### Some Children Were Playing beside a River. They Made Castles of Sand, and Each Child Defended His Castle and Said, ‘this One is mine.' They Kept Their Castles Separate and Would not Allow Any Mistakes about Which Was Whose. When the Castles Were All Finished, One Child Kicked over Someone Else's Castle and Completely Destroyed It. The Owner of the Castle Flew into a Rage, Pulled the other Child's Hair, Struck Him with His Fist and Bawled Out, ‘he Has Spoiled My Castle! Come along All of You and Help Me Punish Him as He deserves.' the Others All Came to His Help. They Beat the Child … then They Went on Playing in Their Sand Castles, Each Saying, ‘this is Mine; no One Else May Have It. Keep Away! Don't touch My castle!'

#### But Evening Came, it Was Getting Dark and They All Thought They Ought to Be Going Home. No One now Cared what Became of His Castle. One Child Stamped on His, Another Pushed His over with both Hands. Then They Turned away and Went Back, Each to His Home.

### Do We Act Any Differently than These Children? We Live Our Lives Building Castles in the Sand only to Leave Them behind as Meaningless when the long Night of Death Falls.

### Imagine for a Moment that You Accomplished Everything You Wanted in Life. You Succeeded in All Your Worldly Affairs. Perhaps You're Jeff Bezos and You've Accumulated a $100 Billion Fortune. Or Perhaps You're Tom Brady and You Won Seven Super Bowls. While These Are Amazing Accomplishments, both of Those Men Will Die, and when They Do, They Won't Be Taking Any of Their Wealth or Attainments with Them. In Fact, if They Cling to Their Attainments on Their Deathbed, They Will Feel Anguish and Sorrow, and They Will Endure a Great Deal of Suffering. How Will Their Worldly Attainments Benefit Them Then?

### You Are Going to Die. You Could Die Today. None of Your Worldly Attainments or Possessions Are Important. You Won't Be Taking Any of it with You.

### Shortly after Your Death, Your Possessions Will Be Disbursed to Various People, and Your Corpse Will Be Disposed Of. A Form of You Remains in the Memories of Those Who Knew You. Those Who Outlive You May Remember You Kindly, or They May Not. You May Have a Memorial Headstone, or no Permanent Record of You May Exist at All. Everything You Worked For, Struggled Against, Hoped, Dreamed, Felt - Everything Will Be Summarized by a Dash between the Dates on Your Gravestone. Most People Won't Have Any More Details on Your Life than What's Contained in that Dash.

### After Your Funeral Service, Most People Will Go back to Their Self-important Thoughts, and Thoughts of You Will Arise less and less Often until You Are Finally Forgotten.

### A Hundred Years after Your Death, Everyone Who Knew You Will also Be Dead (not that They Spent much time Remembering You anyway), and Nobody Will Visit Your Gravestone. Even Your Gravestone Will Finally Be Forgotten or Destroyed.

### All Evidence of Your Existence Will Be Gone.

### As Styx Pointed out in Nothing Ever Goes as Planned: "even Pharaohs Turn to Sand, like a Drop in the ocean". Given These Facts, why Would You Waste Your time Building Castles in the Sand? Given These Facts, why Would You Attach Yourself to Anything? If You Don't Attach Yourself to Life and Worry about Everything, Life Becomes a Grand Adventure Full of Fun and Excitement. When Items You Desire come to You, You Enjoy Them with Thanks, and then You Let Them Go.

### As Freddie Mercury Said in Bohemian Rhapsody: "carry On, Carry On, as if Nothing Really matters."

## Recognize the Impermanence of All Things

### When You Recognize Nothing Last Forever

#### You Aren't as Inclined to Attached Yourself to it because You Know You Won't Be Keeping it Forever

#### This Doesn't just Apply to Objects, but also to People and Life Circumstances

### When You Have Something Pleasant and Impermanent,

#### The Natural Reaction is to Feel Thankful for what You Have

#### You Cherish Objects, People, Circumstances while They Last More than before because You Know You Won't Have Them Later

#### Thankfulness is the opposite of Entitlement

## How to Reduce the Power of Attachments once Formed

### It's Nearly Impossible to Go through Life without Forming Attachments

#### Mostly the Effort of Attachment is Expended in Reducing Their Impact

### A Deeper Understanding of Death Reveals that Everything is Impermanent

#### Impermanence Causes Many People Anxiety

##### Which is why so Few Spend Any time Thinking about Death

##### And when They Do, it Makes Them Feel Uneasy

## The Difference between want and Desire

### The Most effective Method I’ve Found to Reducing Attachment is to Cultivate the Mind of Non-attachment

#### Non-attachment is a State of wanting without Desire

### I Would Parse the Words "want" and "desire" as Two Different Things. Wanting is the Wish for Something to Occur or to Possess Some Object. Buddhists, including Monks, want to Be Enlightened and Liberated from Suffering. The want Pushes Them to Meditate, Live a Monastic Life, and Try to Better Themselves to Escape Samsara, the Cyclic Nature of Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death. Wanting is not Bad.

### Desire on the other Hand is Born of Attachment. It's the Suffering that Comes from failing to Obtain Some Object of Desire or Losing One that You Already Have. The Key to Spiritual Practice, to Abandoning Your Attachments is to Learn to Parse wanting and Desire so that You Can want for Things but Put no Importance on whether or not You Obtain Them. If Something Comes to You, You Enjoy it with Thanks, and then You Let it Go. You Get All the Upside of Joy and None of the Downside of Suffering. Now, if I Could just Figure out how to Do That....

### Non-attachment is not Indifference

#### Many People Mistake Non-attachment to a State of Indifference. They Are not the Same.. Many Things Still Matter to Me, and Events Occur All the time that I Wish Were Different than They Are. I Work Very Hard not to Attach Myself to Outcomes and Be Completely Accepting of whatever Occurs. The Emotion I Link to Attachment is "importance". How Important is it to You that You Get what You Want? I Try to Reduce This Importance to Zero. I'm not Indifferent. I Still want Things and Have Preferences, but I Don't Put much Importance on the Outcome. If Something Happens that I Wanted to Happen, then I Get to Enjoy whatever it Is. If it Doesn't Happen, then I Accept that and Move On.

#### Have You Seen Those Videos of Football Fans Hitting Their Tv Sets and Otherwise Going Ballistic over Their Team Losing a Game? I Love Watching Football, and I Feel Excitement and Exhilaration when My Favorite Team Wins, but when They Lose, I Don't Get Upset because I Recognize that is Isn't Important.

### Take Control over what You Feel is Important, and what is not

#### If You Don't Acknowledge that the Importance You place on Things is the Cause of Your Suffering, You. Will Continue to Form Attachments and Suffer Accordingly

#### The Book. "don't Sweat the Small Stuff, and It's All Small stuff" is Written about This Topic

#### When You Gain Control over What's Important -- and Recognize Nothing is Important -- You Get All the Upside and None of the Downside. Your Life Becomes Peaceful, and You Are Content Nearly All of the Time.

# Love Opposes Personal Attachment

## Quote

## What is Love?

### For a Topic that is so Widely Discussed, You Would Think there Was a Universally Accepted Definition

#### There Isn't

### Is Love a Thing?

### Is Love a Feeling?

### Is Love an Action?

### Dictionary

#### An Intense Feeling of Deep Affection.

#### Most People when They Think about Love, They Define it as a Feeling

#### Further, Most People Confuse Their Feelings of Attachment for Love

#### Many People Believe Love is a Random Feeling, a Passion outside Their Control

##### There is a Kernel of Truth here as the Conditions and Characteristics of People that Create an Initial Spark is Mysterious

##### But the Feeling of Love, the Deep Affection of Others, Can Be Cultivated and Enhanced

#### People Often Make Life Decisions Based on the Intensity of the Feeling of Love

##### Most People Chose Life Partners This way

##### It's a Good Start, but as the High Divorce Rate Proves, it Isn't the Best or Most Important Criteria

##### The Intensity of the Feelings of Love Ebbs and Flows

###### Chivalry Dictates that Love is either Increasing or Decreasing but Never in a Steady State.

###### Any Emotion Will Change in Intensity over Time, Love is not Unique in This regard

###### The Problem is that People Will Make Life Decisions Based on These Changes

#### The Feeling is a Critical part of Love, but It's only a part

#### Love is Supported by Action

### 1 Corinthians 13:4-5

#### The Bible Has a Wonderful Description of Love Based on the Actions of Love rather than the Feelings Associated

#### Love is Patient, Love is Kind. It Does not Envy, it Does not Boast, it is not Proud. It Does not Dishonor Others, it is not Self-seeking, it is not Easily Angered, it Keeps no Record of Wrongs.

#### Focuses Attention on the Actions Associated with the Feeling

##### Patient, Accepting People as They Are with no Resistance

##### Kind, Expressing Feelings of Warmth, Performing Acts of Service

##### No Envy, Does not Express of Feel Jealousy

##### No Boasting, not Proud, Does not Feel Superiority over Others

##### When You Cultivate Thoughts of Love, Your Heart Responds with Love, Peace, and Happiness

##### When Positive Thoughts Support a Joyous Heart, the outward Manifestation is Acts of Kindness

### Wikipedia

#### The Unselfish Loyal and Benevolent Concern for the Good of Another

#### My Favorite Definition of Love Comes from Wikipedia

#### As a Parent of a Special Needs Child, My Duty is to provide Unselfish, Loyal, and Benevolent Concern for My Son

#### This Mind Informs My Feelings Which Motivates My Actions

## Love is both a Feeling and an Activity

### The Feeling of Intense Affection

#### Can Be Natural, Familial

#### Can Be Cultivated

##### In Meditation You Can Extend Love from Family to Friends and Others

##### One of the Most Powerful Meditations for Overcoming Resentments and Practicing Forgiveness is to Meditate on Love for Your Enemies

### The Feeling Inspires Action

#### Virtue Springs from Love

#### Giving

#### Forgiving

#### Acceptance

### The Actions Generate More Feelings

#### The Virtuous Circle of Love where Feeling Drives Action that Increases Feeling

#### Kindness is the Cultivated State where Loving Feelings and Actions Intertwine

### Cultivating a Mind of Love Takes Practice

#### Love is More than a Feeling, It's a Feeling Supported by Action

#### Love Grows when You Hold Positive Thoughts in Your Mind and Heart

#### Love Diminishes when You Cultivate Thoughts of Anger, Resentment and Hatred

#### Love Grows when You Give, Forgive, and Practice Acceptance

#### Love Grows when You Act out of Kindness and Friendliness toward Others

## Attachment is not Love

## Cultivating Love for Others

### The Tree of Love

#### Affectionate Love

#### Service and Devotion

#### Compassion and Joy

##### Desire for Everyone to Be Happy and Free from Suffering

##### Obtaining Pleasure from the Happiness of Others

### Rose Colored Glasses

#### Focus on Good Traits

## The Benefits of Cultivating a Mind of Love

### A Loving Mind is less Prone to Disturbance by Anger or Jealousy

### A Mind of Love Makes Practicing Generosity, Kindness, and Thankfulness Easy and Natural

### People Are Naturally Drawn to Those Who Cultivate and Exude Feelings of Love and Acceptance

### A Loving Mind Improves the Quality of All Your Relationships

# Generosity Opposes Greed

## Greed is a Manifestation of Attachment

### Once You've Acquired a Precious Resource

#### You Don't want to Lose it

#### You want to Consume or Enjoy it Yourself

#### You May Act Violently toward Those Who Try to Take it or Destroy it

### Once We Form Attachments to People or Objects, We want to Possess Them Forever

#### Whenever the Object of Our Attachment is Parted from Us, We Suffer

#### Whenever We Think about Losing the Possession, We Worry and Feel Anxiety

#### Whenever We Give away an Object of Attachment We Feel Regret for Our Generosity

##### The Fear of This Regret Stops Most People from Giving at All

#### The Stronger the Attachment, the Greater the Suffering

##### The More We Cling to Our Possessions, the Greater Our Sense of lack Becomes

## Superficially, Greed Appears as a Wise Strategy to Ensure Our Survival

### There is a Kernel of Truth

#### Giving away All Your Possessions, Food, and Shelter Would Be Unwise

### But We React with the Same Vigor to Potential Loss of Our Luxuries as We Do to Our Necessities

### We Ignore the Temporary Nature of All Possessions

#### When We Die, We Won't Be Taking Our Things with Us

### If We Wait until Death to Give up Our Possessions

#### We Don't Experience the Joy of Giving while We Are Alive

### It's Incumbent upon Us to Focus on the Joys of Giving

## Types of Giving

### Give Material Help to Those in Poverty

### Giving Practical Help to Those Who Are Sick or Disabled

### Giving Protection by Trying to save Others and Prevent Harm

### Giving Love by Always Believing the Happiness of Others is Important

### A Gift is given with no Thought to what You Will Receive in return

#### A Gift with Strings Attached is a Bribe

#### The Expectation for Reward Taints the Gift

##### Provides Opportunity to Turn Joy into Suffering

###### If You Don't Get the Thanks and Praise You Feel is Your due

## Benefits of Giving

### You Receive Joy in Pleasing Others with Your Gift

#### Even if the Person Doesn't Thank You or Appreciate the Gift

#### The Pure Heart that Made the Offer Provides a Joyous Reward

#### The Greatest Joy Comes from Giving away Items of Strong Attachment

##### The Desire to Keep the Object Says the opposite

##### Giving away an Object of Strong Attachment Removes that Attachment from Your Life

##### Enjoying Items that Give You Pleasure is Good

###### Up to the point They Become an Attachment

#### The Joy from Giving Has Little relation to the Cost of What's given

##### I Gain Tremendous Joy from Feeding Birds, and that Costs Me Very Little

##### I once Gave away a Car, and that Giving Became a Problem and Source of Suffering

##### What's More Important is the Joy or Utility the Recipient Will Obtain from the Gift

##### Frequent Thoughtful Gifts given with the Proper Heart is More Impactful that Large Expensive Gifts Designed to Impress

##### We Should Practice Giving in Ways that Maximize the Benefits to Ourselves and Others

### All Abundance Springs from Giving

#### It Sounds as if the opposite Would Be True

##### Giving Reduces the Amount of Resources You Have Available

##### How Could Reducing Your Resource Levels Promote Abundance?

#### The Feeling of Abundance Comes from the Belief that You Will Always Have Enough

##### When You Give, You Give from a Heart of Abundance

##### You Would not Give if You Believed You Would Do without or not Have Your Own Needs Met

##### Giving Trains the Heart to Feel Abundance

##### Giving Trains the Mind to Believe You Will Always Have Enough

#### The More You Give, the More Abundance You Will Feel

# Thankfulness Opposes Despair

## Despair is a Sadly Common Human Condition

### Everyone Has Aspirations

### Most Have Faith that Tomorrow Can Be Better than Today

### The Aspiration for and the Belief in the Possibility in a Better Tomorrow is Hope

### When Events Occur that Shake This Faith, Hope Can Fade, and Despair Results

### Our Hopes Often Get Tangled with Our Attachments to People or Outcomes of Events

### When People Don't Behave as We Desire, or if Events Don't Turn out as We Desire

#### We Must Endure the Sadness of the Loss

#### When These Disappointments and Attachments Are Entangled with Our Hopes and Aspirations, Despair Can Ensue

## Despair Takes Root in Negative Stories about the Future

### Despair and Depression Reinforce Each other

#### A Negative Outcome the Triggers Sadness Can Lead to Depression

#### Once Depressed, People Lose Hope that the Will Ever Feel Anything other than Sadness

#### When Sadness and Depression Becomes the Norm, Despair Sets in

### When Something Deeply Saddening Occurs, People Start to Tell Themselves Stories about how Awful the Future Will Be

### If You Accept These Stories and Imagine a Negative Future Full of Suffering, it Becomes Self-fulfilling

### Despair Becomes a Deep Rut That's Difficult to Get out of

#### Because We Believe the Stories that Keeps Us Trapped there

## Breaking Free of Despair Requires a Different Future Narrative

### "everything Can Be Taken from a Man but One Thing: the Last of the Human Freedoms-to Choose One's Attitude in Any given Set of Circumstances, to Choose One's Own way."

#### ― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's search for Meaning

### You Will not Gain Peace and Acceptance of a Belief that Your Future Holds no Hope

### Whatever Future Problems You Imagine, there Are other Opportunities that Are Open to You

### You Must Find and Focus on Those Aspects of Your Future You Believe Will Bring Joy and Happiness to Your Life

### You Have the Power to Chose what You want to Believe about Your Own Life Circumstances

### You Can Chose to Find Those Things You Are Thankful for

## Redirect Your Thinking toward Thankfulness

### Combatting Despair Requires Rigorous Mental Discipline

### The Mind Easily and Naturally Repeats False Negative Narratives

### Whenever This Sequence of Thoughts Starts, it Must Be Redirected Immediately

### Noticing the Pattern of Thought and Choosing to Cut it off by Redirection is a Mental Discipline

#### If You Don't Engage in the Practice

##### You Will Follow that Train of Thought over and over Again

##### Each Time, it Leads to Misery and Suffering

##### The More Often You Do It, the Worse the Problem Gets

##### Your Mood is Sure to Sour

##### You Can Become Depressed or Remain Locked in Depression

### To Successfully Redirect, You Need a Series of Items to Think about instead

### You Need a List of Counterbalancing Thoughts You Can Rely on to Change the Narrative

## Develop a List of Items You Are Thankful for to counter Each Negative Pattern

### Recognizing Your Negative Pattern of Thought Usually Isn't Too Difficult as Most People Know what Troubles Them

### Finding the List of Items You Are Thankful for to Negate Those Negative Thoughts is More Challenging

#### Your Mind Will Object to even considering Positive Alternatives

#### It Will Feel Contrived and Unnatural

#### At First, You May Discount the Power of the Thankful Idea

#### It's Still a Critical step because without These Ideas, You Don't Have Any Defense against the Onslaught of Negativity that Generates Despair

### The Thankfulness List Doesn't Have to Contain "big" Items

#### I Cried because I Had no Shoes until I Met a Man Who Had no Feet.

#### I Cried because My Child Had Special Needs until I Met a Family whose Child Had Died

##### You Can Always Be Thankful for Being Alive

#### Ideally, the Item You're Thankful for Should Be Directly Related to the Item Causing You Grief

# Rejoicing Opposes Jealousy

## The Human Condition is One of lack

### Without the Support of Family, Tribe, or Society, We lack Resources for Survival

#### Humans Are a Socially Adapted Species with Deep Interdependencies

#### While We Have Cultural Icons of Rugged Individualism, the Reality is that without Group Cooperation, Most People Would not Survive

### Our Instincts Are to Seek out Places of Shelter and Resources for Our Continued Survival

#### If This Were not True, We Would not Have Survived as a Species

### Since We Instinctively Seek to Meet Our Needs, We Are Driven by an Overwhelming Sense of lack

### The Buddha Termed This Malaise a Deep Sense of Unsatisfactoriness

#### This is Often Translated as Suffering

##### And there is Suffering to it

##### But It's not Necessarily Overt Suffering and Pain

#### The Typical State of a Human is a Sense of Dissatisfaction that Drives Behavior to Seek Scarce Resources and Look for Places of Shelter

##### We Live in a State of Anxiety about Our Safety

##### And a Sense of lack concerning Our Resources

## Jealousy and Covetousness Are Common Reactions to lack

### Since We Feel Anxiety about Our Safety

#### We Feel Aversion to Those Who Would Cause Us Harm

#### We Covet Places of Safety

### Since We Feel lack concerning Our Resources

#### We Feel Aversion to Those Who Have More than We Do

#### We Covet the Resources of Others

### Both of These Conditions Lead to Jealousy and the want for other People's Possessions

### Jealousy is the Mind's Foolish Attempt to Alleviate Anxiety and Obtain Resources

### An Untrained Mind with no Spiritual Practice Exists in a Permanent State of Anxiety and Lack, Jealous of the Safety and Possessions of Others

## The Problems with Jealousy

### Jealousy is Displeasure with Someone Else's Good Fortune

### You Can Become Jealous of Another's Possessions, Good Qualities, Skills, Knowledge, Reputation, Fame or Popularity

#### Basically Anything Another Person Has that You want

### Jealousy is a Source of Anger, Discontent, and Mental Disturbance

### Jealousy Leads to Obsession, a Persistent Mental Disturbance

### Jealousy Can Lead to the Desire to Harm Others, the opposite of Compassion

### Jealousy is a Futile Waste of time and Energy

#### Jealousy Does not Increase Your Good Qualities

#### Jealousy Does not Reduce the Good Qualities of Others

#### Jealousy only Succeeds in Disturbing Peace of Mind

## Jealousy Lowers the Quality of All Your Relationships

### Jealousy Robs Us of the Opportunity to Feel Joy for other People, including Friends and Family

### Jealousy Prevents Us from Exchanging Places with Others, Isolating Us and Fostering Selfishness

### Jealousy is Corrosive to Our Relationships

#### You Can't Feel Good about Your Friends and Family's Good Fortune

#### You Tear down Good People in Your Mind

#### People Often Work to Harm Others and Remove Their Sources of Happiness

##### A Source of Non-virtuous Action

##### Often the Cause of Physical Violence

### You End up with Friends and Acquaintances that Are Unhappy and Generally Unpleasant, More Miserable, less Skilled, Poorer, in Every way less than You Are

#### This Happens because Jealousy Pushes away Anyone whose Qualities Made You Feel Jealousy

##### They Wouldn't want to Be around You Any More than You Would want to Be around Them

##### This Leaves You with the Worst of the Worst People as Friends

##### Your Every Interaction with Your Friendly Acquaintances Will Be Tearing down Others and Pointing out Their Perceived Weaknesses and Foibles

## Rejoicing is the Opponent to Jealousy

### Obtaining Joy from Another's Accomplishments and Possessions

#### An Easy way to Start is to Rejoice in Pleasures People Take in Objects or Activities that Don't Interest You

##### If it doesn’t Trigger Your Own Jealousy, It's Easier to Appreciate the Joy it Brings Another Person

##### Once You Feel the Joy in Rejoicing in Another's Enjoyments, You Become Familiar with the Feeling

#### Once You're Familiar with Reveling in the Joy Experienced by Others

##### You Can Think about Those People Who Have Things that You want

##### Lessen Your Jealousy

##### Learn to Feel Joy for the Pleasure They Obtained through Your Object of Desire

#### Exchange Yourself with the other Person and Enjoy the Object through Them

##### Rejoicing is a Practice of a Pure Mind Unhindered by Selfish Concerns

##### Rejoicing in the Good Fortune of Others Creates the Cause for Us to Develop Similar Good Traits

### The More You Honor the Good Fortune and Good Qualities of Others, the More You Are Elevated

#### The Mind Thinks the opposite is True

#### The Mind Seeks to Elevation the Self by Bringing Others down

#### Rejoicing Elevates the Self by Reveling in Another's Goodness

### Feel Humility in Comparison to Others

#### Offer respect when Another's Achievements Are Greater than Your Own

#### Compliment Others on the Beauty and Utility of Their Possessions

#### Express Pleasure in the Enjoyments and Pleasures of Others

#### Honor Those with Fame or Good Reputation

### Rejoicing in the Pleasures and Accomplishments of Others Attracts Better Friends

#### People Naturally want to Be around Others Who Celebrate Their Accomplishments

#### People Who Rejoice with Others Are Truly Supportive Friends that Wish only the Best for Them

#### When You Rejoice with Others, People with Superior Traits Take Pleasure in Your Company

##### When You Associate with Those More Accomplished than Yourself, it Elevates You

##### Your Environment Becomes a Source of Strength

### Rejoicing Diminishes Feeling of lack

#### When You Are Focused on Someone Else's Enjoyments, You Are not Thinking about Your Own lack

#### Rejoicing Comes from a Mind of Abundance

##### A Belief that You Will not Experience lack

#### As the Sense of lack Diminishes, the Root Cause of Jealousy is Weakened

# Acceptance Opposes Anger

## Anger is a Unpleasant Feeling Generated by a Negative State of Mind

### Anger is One of the Most Common and Easily Recognizable Disturbances of Mind

#### Anger is not Subtle and Leaves no Doubt about It's Presence

### You Are Responsible for Your Anger

#### Anger is not Caused by other People or Their Behavior

#### Anger is not Caused by the Event

#### Anger is not Unavoidable or Uncontrollable

#### People like to Believe They Are not in Control of Their Anger because it Provides Them Justification for the Inappropriate Actions that Follow from an Angry Mind

##### Unfortunately, the opposite is True

##### You Are Responsible for Your Anger and the Behavior You Engage in because of Your Anger

#### Through Engaging in the Practices of Acceptance, Non-retaliation, and Forgiveness, Anger Will not Arise at All

### How Anger Arises

#### Anger Requires Focus on a Particular Object or Event

#### A Judgment that It's Undesirable or Unattractive

##### In other Words, it Becomes a Problem

#### A Focus Exclusively on the Negative Qualities

##### Exaggerates Those Qualities

#### You Blame the Object, Event or Person for Causing Your Negative Circumstances

#### You Foster a Desire to Resist, Harm, or Push away what You Identify as the Cause

### The Desire to Resist, Harm or Push away is the Common Feeling We Recognize as Anger

#### The Feeling of Anger is Actually a Bi-product of a Mental Process

##### It Happens so Quickly and so Instinctively that People Don't Recognize there is a Process behind it

##### Since it is Caused by a Mental Process, there Are Many Ways to Break the Pattern and Stop that Process from Moving forward and Generating Anger

## Three Common Events that Generate Anger

### Failure to Obtain Something You Wanted

### Getting Something You Didn't want

### Losing Something You Had

### These Events Occur Thousands of times a Day in Varying Degrees

### The Good News is that Every Occasion for Anger is an Opportunity to Practice Acceptance and Grow Spiritually

## Overcoming Anger Requires Recognizing Its Many Faults

### Anger is Very Disturbing and Painful, the opposite of Peace of Mind

### Anger Negates Our Ability to Reason and Exercise Good Judgement

### Anger, Resentment and Hatred Can Boil over into Rage and Total Loss of Self Control

#### Nothing You Have Ever Done under Anger's Influence Has Helped You in Any way

#### Without Self Control, We Lose or Freedom of Choice and Become a Slave to Our Anger

##### Rage Can Lead to Assault and Murder

##### Rage Can Lead to Serious Negative Consequences for You and Others

#### In a Fit of Rage, We May Harm Those Closest to Us, People Who Have Been Kind and Giving to Us in the past

### Anger Motivates Vengeance

#### Anger Leads to Suffering for the Angry Person and Others

#### Intentionally Harming Others is the opposite of Compassion

##### "revenge Is a Dish Best Served cold"

###### Charles Maurice De Talleyrand-Perigord

##### The Desire for Vengeance Promises Satisfaction but Never Delivers it

#### If Acted Upon, the Desire for Retaliation Motivates Criminal Activity or Actions with Civil Liability

### Unresolved Anger Has Long-term Negative Side Effects

#### Persistent Anger Develops into Hatred, a Persistent Mental Disturbance

#### Anger Strongly Impacts Your Body and Health

##### Tension and Discomfort

##### Disturbs Our Sleep, Making it Fitful and not Restive

###### Sleep Deprivation

##### Excessive Adrenal Activity

##### Hypertension

#### Anger Causes Strongly Negative Mental States

##### Anger Leads to Paranoia as Everyone Becomes an Enemy

##### Anger Can Harden into Resentment

##### Anger Can Build up to Become Hatred and Contempt

#### Anger Motivates People to Push away Others

##### Anger Causes Aversion, or the Desire to Push away

##### Chronically Angry People Die Alone with Nobody to Care for Them

### Anger is a State of Mind to Be Completely Abandoned

#### To Eliminate Anger We Must Recognize It's Many Faults, and Incorporate Practices to Prevent it Arising and Squelch it if it Does

#### At First, We Will Do well to Diminish and Minimize Our Anger

#### But the Goal is to Completely Eradicate it

## Angry People Die Alone

### Anger is not Pleasant for Others, nor is it Attractive

#### Anger Transforms a Normally Attractive Person into a Ghoulish Demon

### People Who Habitually Express Anger Are Avoided by Everyone Who Knows Them

### Angry People Are Shunned by Others They've Pushed Away, Which is Often Everyone

### All Personal Enemies Are Created by Mind Alone

#### People Who We Blame for Negative Actions against Us Become Enemies in Our Mind

#### We Harden Our Negative Opinion of the Person into Hatred, Often with the Desire to Retaliate

#### If Anger is Our Predominant Reaction to the World, Everyone Becomes an Enemy

#### A World Full of Enemies Results in Paranoia and a Wide Variety of Negative Behaviors Ostensibly Designed to provide Protection from Perceived Enemies

#### The Belief that Everyone Hates Us Leads to Isolation and Despair

#### Instead of Life Being an Accumulation of Friends, for an Angry Person, Life Experience is the Accumulation of Enemies and People They Hate

### Anger Makes Us and Others Miserable, Bringing Despair to Those Who once Loved Us

#### Even in a Loving Relationship, a Fit of Anger Reduces the Connection to Zero and Prevents the Accumulation of Goodwill Necessary to Sustain a Loving Connection

#### Eckhart Tolle Calls it a "pain body" Episode.

##### Your Train of Thought Brings up Every Negative Associate You Have with a Person

##### You Flog Them in Your Mind until All Goodwill is Driven from Your Heart

##### The Pain Body Continues until the Connection is Reduced to Zero

##### It's a Scorched Earth Approach to Interpersonal Relationship

### People under Anger's Influence Engage in Destructive Behaviors like Retaliation

## Anger Serves no Constructive Purpose

### Anger Does Nothing to Change the Conditions You Perceive as the Cause of Your Anger

### People Use Anger and Resentment as a way to Manipulate the Behavior of Others

#### Do what I Want, or I Will Be Angry with You

##### Do You Have People in Your Live You Bear Grudges Against?

##### Do You Have Preconditions They Must Meet in order to Earn Your Forgiveness?

###### Preconditions to Forgiveness Are a Manipulative Attempt to Control

###### The Person toward Whom the Preconditions Are Ascribed is Very Unlikely to Comply

###### As a Result, You Are Likely to Bear that Grudge, and Endure the Pain of Your Anger Forever

#### People Who Form Resentments Were Rewarded for Doing so

##### Occasionally, People Will Ask for Forgiveness and Promise to Be Different

###### They May Feel Genuine Remorse and Regret over Something They Did

###### If You Interpret This as Them Succumbing to Your Angry Manipulation, You Feel Rewarded for Your Anger

Even though it was not your anger that prompted the person to ask for forgiveness

They acted on their own accord out of remorse

##### Makes it Harder to Abandon

### Determination Forged from Anger is not Worth the Price Paid

#### Some People Subscribe to the Idea that Anger is Useful when Directed toward a Useful End

##### I Don't Dispute that the Technique Can Motivate Positive Change

##### Determination Can Be a Force for Doing Good Work

##### However, Sustaining This Determination Requires Sustaining the Mental Disturbance

###### Sustaining Anger Carries All the Negatives of Anger

###### The Price of This Motivation is Too High

#### Determination Forged from Anger Poisons the Intent

## Stop Blaming Others for Your Anger

### The Habit to Judge and Blame is a Source of Anger

#### Some People Evaluate Every Interaction with Another Person

##### They Assign Blame for Any Perceived Misdeed

###### Though Often, They Don't Bother to Assign Praise and Remember the Good

#### They Record This Blame Mentally in an account of This Person's Character

##### This Mental Ledger of Slights and Misdeeds Becomes Useful Ammunition during a Future Angry exchange

##### This also Becomes Fodder for Feelings of Jealousy

### Blaming Others for Our Anger Ostensibly Negates Our Responsibility for it

#### The Ego Never Likes to Take Responsibility for Anything

#### Human Nature is to Deny Personal Responsibility and Look for External Events or People to Assign Blame to for Our Misfortune

#### Most People Don't Recognize or Accept that They Are Solely Responsible for the Anger They Experience

#### To Dodge Responsibility for Our Own Anger, We Assign that Responsibility to Others

##### This Makes it Relatively Easy to Sustain Anger as well

###### We Merely Have to Recount the Reasons for the Other's Responsibility

### Assigning Blame and Recording the Reasons Sustains Anger, Creates Enemies, and Hardens into Resentment and Hatred

#### Assigning Blame is the Necessary First step

#### If You Don't Assign This Blame, and instead Take Responsibility, the Anger Dissipates and Eventually Goes away Entirely

### Even if the Actions of Another Cause Us Harm, We Shouldn't Blame Them and Sustain Anger

#### Someone that Practices Patience and Harbors no Ill Will toward Anyone Has no Enemies and is less Likely to Be a Victim of Harm by Another

#### Even if Harmed by Another, a Spiritual Practitioner Would Seek to Feel Compassion for Their Assailant Recognizing the Strong Delusions that Motivated Their Behavior

##### This Isn't Easy, but it is Necessary

#### Justifiable Anger is the Hardest to Overcome

##### The Justifications May Be True and Accurate

##### The Anger May Be Completely Warranted and Understandable by Everyone

##### But Feeling and Sustaining that Anger is Still Carries All the Negative Side Effects of Anger

##### Justifiable Anger is Still Anger that Must Be Abandoned

### Don't Play the Blame Game

#### You Are not Everyone's Judge and Jury

##### Your Judgments Are Probably not Accurate as You Don't Have All the Information

##### Let He Who is without Sin Cast the First Stone

###### Jesus Christ, John 8:7

#### Assigning Blame and Keeping Accounts of Negative Actions Has only Negative Benefits

##### It's Useful for Emotional Retaliation during Heated Arguments in an Attempt to Manipulate Their Behavior to Conform to Our Wishes

##### And It's Useful as a Basis for Jealous Retaliation and Diminishing Others in Our Mind

##### Neither Activity is Virtuous or Beneficial to Others or Our Relationships with Them

##### If You Don't Record the Blame, You Won't Engage in the Negative Activities that Require that Information

#### You May Still Make Note of Someone's Character and Desirability for Interaction

##### You Still Make Judgments about whether or not You want to Allow People into Your Life

###### There Are People I Prefer not to Spend time With, but I Don't Have Any Anger toward Them

I feel compassion for their delusions

But I don't want to get caught up in their delusional dramas

#### The Blame Game is about Sustaining Anger through Remembering Specifics about Negative Judgments and Using that Material for Later Hurtful Actions

## Acceptance is the Opponent to Anger

### Acceptance is a Mind that Welcomes whatever Occurs without Resistance

#### We Constantly Make Judgments about what We Want, what We Don't Want, and when We want it

#### These Judgments Set up the Conditions for Disappointment and for Anger to Arise

#### The Stronger Our Preferences, the Stronger Our Reaction Will Be when Things Don't Turn out as We want

#### The Mind of Acceptance Has no Strongly Held Preferences with no Importance on Fulfillment

### Acceptance Requires Two Related Spiritual Practices

#### A Mind of Non-judgment

#### A Mind of Non-attachment

#### It's Difficult to Obtain and Sustain a Mind of Acceptance without the other Two Practices

### How Non-judgment Supports Acceptance

#### The Three Conditions that Generate Anger Require a Judgment as to What's Desirable or Undesirable

#### To Obtain Something You Want, You Must Make a Judgment about what You want

#### If You Obtain Something You Don't Want, You Must Make a Judgment about the lack of Desirability of what You Obtained

#### If You Don't Make the Judgment, or if You Don't Put much Weight behind the Judgment, whatever Occurs Doesn't Have the Ability to Make You Angry

#### With a Mind of Non-judgment, even what Most Would Consider Dire Circumstances Won't Disrupt Your Peace of Mind

#### Acceptance is to Voluntarily Endure Pain and Suffering without Pushing it away or Judging it Negatively

### How Non-attachment Supports Acceptance

#### If You Become Angry for Losing Something that Was Important to You

##### The Loss is Painful due to Your Attachment

#### If You Don't Resist the Loss, if You Don't place Undue Importance on Keeping the Object

##### You Don't Feel the Pain of Loss

##### And You Won't Get Angry about it

### The Characteristics of a Mind of Acceptance

#### Acceptance is the opposite of Resistance

#### Acceptance is to Wholeheartedly Accept Things Exactly as They Are and not want for Circumstances to Be Any Different

##### This Was the Definition of Acceptance that Changed My Life

## Acceptance is a Practiced Skill

### Knowingly Accepting Pain and Suffering Increases Familiarity with Acceptance and Increases Capacity for Acceptance

#### If You Can Practice Acceptance with Small Things, Big Things Become Easier

##### With Practice and Perseverance, even Catastrophic Events Won't Disturb Your Peace of Mind

#### Buddhist Practice of Viewing Pain as Cleansing One's Karma

#### That Which Doesn't Kill Me Makes Me Stronger

##### Friedrich Nietzsche

#### Pain is Weakness Leaving the Body

##### Us Marine Corp

### Acceptance is not Weakness

#### Acceptance is not a Passive or Indecisive Response to Problems

#### Acceptance Takes Enormous Strength and Courage

#### Losing Control and Acting Rashly is Weakness the Feigns Strength

### Make a Practice of Accepting Pain rather than Resisting it

#### Do You Reach for an Aspirin with a Minor Headache?

#### Consciously Accept the Pain rather than Push it away and Resist it

### When You come to Believe You Can Endure Any Hardship, You Live without Fear in a State of Serenity

### A Person Who Can Willingly Accept Any Suffering or Hardship is a True Hero

## The Serenity Prayer

### God, Grant Me the Serenity to Accept the Things I Cannot Change,

# Courage to Change the Things I Can,

# And Wisdom to Know the Difference.

## If You Are Angry or Full of Anxiety, Acceptance is the Cure

## It Doesn't Mean You Accept Injustice or Give up on Pursuing Goals when You Meet Resistance

## The Wisdom to Recognize what You Can Change and what You Can't is the Key

## If You Can Change Something, and You Believe It's Desirable to Do So, You Should

### The Serenity Prayer Recognizes that Doing the Right Thing, Particularly in the Face of Resistance, Takes Courage

#### Doing Nothing, or Doing the Wrong Thing is Generally far Easier

## Serenity Isn't Something You Do, It's the State of Mind You Gain though Acceptance

## Acceptance is not Resignation

### You Don't Resign Yourself to Endure Needless Discomfort or Suffering

### If there is Something Practical You Can Do to Correct a Situation, You Should Do so

### But while the Solution is Being Implemented, It's not Productive to Dwell on the Negative Aspects of the Situation and Make Yourself Unhappy

### If there is a way to Remedy a Situation, there is Nothing Gained by Being Unhappy with the Current Circumstance

### And if there is no way to Remedy a Situation, It's Foolish and Futile to Become Unhappy with it

### You Can't Control External Circumstances, but You Can Control Your Internal Reaction to Those Circumstances

## Understanding Karma Assists in Accepting what is

### Karma is the Law of Cause and Effect. Contrary to Popular Opinion, Karma Isn't Something to Be Believed in or Rejected. Karma is a Phenomenon to Be Observed and Understood.

### Karma is the Idea that Every Event Has a Cause (an Idea Science shares). A Person's Karma is a Direct Result of Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors They Engaged in Previously. When Karma Ripens, You Experience the Consequences of Your Previous Actions. People Who Engage in Non-virtuous and Unskilled Actions Experience what They Perceive as Negative Karma, and when They Engage in Virtuous Actions, Positive Outcomes also Result. There is a Direct Connection between One's Actions and the Consequences One Experiences. It's like God's Judgment without the Need for God. Karma is like an Algorithm for God's Judgment for Those Who want to Put God in there Somewhere.

### In This short Lifetime, not All of Our past Karma is Going to Ripen. Further, there Are Many Things that Happen that Don't Seem to Be Connected to Any past Behavior. Hedonists Rely on This to Engage in Non-virtuous Behavior Today because They Believe They Will Dodge the Consequences of that Behavior in This Lifetime. People also Endure Suffering when Inexplicable Events Turn out against Their Wishes.

### To Overcome Those Problems, the Buddha Embraced the Prevailing Hindu Beliefs in Reincarnation, the Idea of Recycling since Beginningless Time. He Posited that We Have All Cycled through Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death an Infinite Number of Times. At Some point during One of Those Previous Lives, We've Participated in Every Possible Non-virtuous Act, and if Something Seemingly Negative and Random Happens in This Life, It's Entirely due to Non-virtuous Behavior You Engaged in during Some past Life.

### Why is that Useful? If You Believed that Everything that Occurs Happens due to Your past Karma, You Don't Ponder "why" Something Happened. You just Immediately Accept it and Move On, a much Better Spiritual State. Speculating on "why" Something Happens is a Doorway to Suffering. You Will Never Find a Satisfactory Answer, and the quest for such an Answer Leads to Suffering. The only way to Avoid that Rabbit Hole of Suffering is Simply not to Go down It. A Sign on the Doorway to that Rabbit Hole Reads, "it's Your past karma." if You Accept the Wisdom of that Sign, You Will Accept what Is, and You Won't Waste Any time Trying to Answer an Unanswerable Question that only Causes Suffering. If You Don't Have that Wisdom, You Will Go down that Rabbit Hole over and over Again and Suffer Needlessly in the Process.

### The Buddha Turned what Was Considered a Common-sense Belief in Reincarnation Prevalent in His Culture and Turned it into a Mechanism to Avoid Suffering and Guide Behavior toward Virtue. It Was a Brilliant Idea.

# Forgiveness Opposes Resentment

## Sustained Anger Becomes Resentment

### Resentment is Remembered Anger and a Desire to Retaliate

### Resentment is Generally Associated with a Perceived Injustice Caused by Another Person

#### But it Can Be Any Anger that is Kept Alive and Directed toward Something or Someone

## Resentment is Often Used to Coerce compliance

### If I’m Angry at You, then You Must Do what I want to Gain My Forgiveness

### If I’m Angry at You, then You Must Do what I want to Avoid My Wrath

### If I’m Angry at You, I Feel Justified if I Take Revenge and Cause You Harm

### In Time, Resentment Will Manifest in Retaliation in Some Form

### People Who Use Resentments to Get what They want from Others Accumulate Many Resentments and Many Enemies

#### To Know People is to Hate Them through an Accumulation of Resentments

#### People Who Form Resentments Accumulate Many Perceived Enemies

### Resentment is much More Dangerous than the Anger that Caused it

#### Basis of Wars, Aggression, and Violence

#### Motivation for Non-virtuous Behavior

#### Corrosive to Long-term Healthy Relationships

## Recognizing the Faults and Futility of Resentment

### Resentment Generally Harms the Person Holding it More than the Person It's Directed toward

### Resentment Hinders Spiritual Growth as it Shuts down Compassion

### Resentment Has All the Negative Qualities of Anger plus the Long-term Side Effects

#### High Blood Pressure

#### Constant Stress

#### Sour Mood

#### Relationship Problems

### The Person Being Resented is Often Unaware of the Resentment against Them

#### And even if They Knew, Most People Would Merely Mirror the Anger and Resentment back

#### Resentment Almost Never Causes the other to Change Their Ways

#### Hatred Never Ceases by Hatred but by Love Alone is Healed; This is the Eternal Rule

##### Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha

## Forgiveness is the Termination of Resentment

### Forgiveness Starts by Recognizing the Need to Do so

#### Maintaining that Your Grudge or Grievance is Justified or Correct is Counter-productive

### Forgiveness is like Patient Acceptance

#### Patient Acceptance is the Opponent to Anger

#### Forgiveness Stops the Resistance to what is

#### The Anger behind Resentment May Be Justified, but It's Never Wise

#### Forgiveness is Never Easy, but Always Necessary

#### Accept whatever Occurred without Resistance

### Feel Compassion for the Person Your Resentment is Directed toward

#### Your Anger May Be Justified Based on what Someone Did to You or Your Family

#### The Person Who Committed the Injustice Was Motivated by Strong Delusions

##### They Are Responsible for Their Actions

###### And They May Face Consequences for what They Did

###### But Those Consequences Should not Flow from Your Actions under Guise of Seeking Revenge

###### Seeking Justice to Protect Others from the Delusional Person is Appropriate

Seeking vengeance to return harm is not appropriate

The actions may be the same, but your internal emotional state is completely different

##### A Person Subject to Strong Delusions like Anger or Greed is under Control of Their Delusions

###### The Delusions Are Ultimately Responsible

##### Direct Your Anger toward the Delusions, not the Person

##### Once You See the Person as a Victim of Their Own Delusions, It's Easier to Feel Compassion for Them

##### This Isn't about what Happens to the Person Who Wronged You

###### This is about how Those Feelings and Resentments Are Harming You

###### Maintaining the Blame and Resentment for the Perpetrator Hurts You, not Them

#### Feeling Compassion for a Perpetrator is not Easy, only Necessary

## Commitment to Non-retaliation

### Revenge or Retaliation Are Motivated by Anger and Resentment

### Retaliation is the opposite of Compassion

#### Compassion is the Wish that no Being Should Be Harmed

#### The Desire for Retaliation is Completely Incompatible with Compassion

### Non-retaliation is not Passivity

#### You Can Defend Yourself from Aggressors without Anger or Retaliation

#### The Martial Art of Aikido is Based on the Idea of Self Defense without Harming Your Attacker

#### If there is a way to Prevent Someone from Harming You or Others, You Should Do so

##### A Perpetrator under Influence of Strong Delusions is like a Loose Cannon that Randomly Causes Damage and Must Be Brought under Control

#### Even if You Must Harm Someone in Self Defense, You Can Do so without Anger Using only the Minimum Force Necessary to Achieve Safety for Yourself or Others

### People want Others to Believe They Will Retaliate as They Consider This Protection against Attack

#### Countries Do This, Mutually Assured Destruction

#### World War 1 Was Triggered by This

#### Anyone Who Purchases a Gun for Personal Protection Believes the Fear of Retaliation is a Deterrent to Criminal Activity

### The Threat of Retaliation is an Illusory Protection against Others

#### Truly Aggressive People Believe They Can counter Any Retaliation

##### Criminals Become More Likely to Carry and Use Weapons when They Believe Their Victims Are Armed

#### People Who Retaliate Are More Likely to Be Victims of Violence in Counter-retaliation

### Are You Prone to Say Hurtful Things during Arguments?

#### Most of Us Are

#### This is Using Resentment to Coerce compliance with Your Wishes

#### Saying Hurtful Things is Your Retaliation for whatever the other Person Did

#### A Commitment to Non-retaliation is a Commitment not to Say Hurtful Things during a Fight

#### This is Extremely Difficult in the Heat of the Moment

#### Only through Practice in Non-retaliation Will You Be Able to Avoid Hurting Others

### A Commitment to Non-retaliation Diminishes Resentments

#### If You Know You Will Never Retaliate

##### Your Mind Will Stop Indulging in Fantasies of Revenge

##### Thought is the Forerunner of All Things

##### If You Don't Think about Retaliation, You Won't Do it

#### Thoughts of Retaliation Keep Grievances and Resentments Alive

##### Resentment Requires Ongoing Anger to Survive

#### Resentments Can Fade if the Anger is not Rekindled

### Non-retaliation Will Improve Your Relationships

#### Do You Know People Who Subscribe to a "scorched earth" Mentality when They Argue?

##### Some People Will Say Anything, no Matter how Hurtful to Others, just to Win an Argument

##### It Isn't about Making a point or Getting Someone Else to Consider what They May Have Done to Harm Us

##### Some People just want to Win at All Costs

##### And the Costs Are Usually Goodwill in a Relationship

#### Don't Speak with Intent to Harm

##### Nobody Wants to Hear Hurtful Speech

##### Nobody Wants to Be the Target of Hurtful Speech

##### If You Never Use Hurtful Speech, You Will Have Friends Everywhere

##### If You Frequently Use Hurtful Speech, You Will Make Enemies and Good People Will Avoid You

#### With Diminished Resentment, Forgiveness Comes More Easily

# Compassion Opposes Vengefulness

## Vengefulness, Malevolence, and spite

### Feelings of Anger and Resentment Can Grow into the Desire to Do Harm to Another Person

### Vengefulness, Malevolence, and spite Are Different terms for This Desire to Harm Others

### To Overcome These Feelings and Grow in Your Connection to Others, You Need to Cultivate Feelings of Compassion

### Fortunately, the Ability to Feel Empathy and Compassion Are Built into Our DNA

#### It's the Root of All Spiritual Practices and the Foundation for Human Society

## What is Compassion?

### Compassion is the Desire to See Others Be Happy and Free from Pain and Suffering

#### Compassion Requires that We Accept the Truth of the Suffering of Others

#### Compassion Manifests from a Feeling of Sadness for Those Who Suffer

#### A Sadness is Rooted in Empathy because We Know how Unpleasant it is for Us when We Suffer, Anguish, or Feel Pain

#### The Desire to Relieve the Pain and Suffering Springs from of the Acceptance of Reality and Feeling Empathy and Sadness for Another's Troubles

### Compassion is what Unites All of Humanity

#### A Universal Belief that no Being Wants to Experience Suffering

#### The Golden Rule is Rooted in Empathy and Compassion

#### Compassion Fosters the Desire to Relieve the Suffering of Others and Motivates Virtuous Caregiving Behavior

### You Can Deepen Compassion by Exchanging Yourself with Another

#### Imagine Yourself in Their Circumstances

#### Feel Their Pain and the Suffering They Endure

## Compassion Gets Mixed with Attachment

### Sometimes Compassion Comes from Selfish Reasons

#### I want My Friend to Feel Better because I want to Enjoy Their Company

#### My Selfish Desire Motivates My Feelings for Another's well Being

### It's Easiest to Feel Compassion for Those We Are Closest to

#### You Suffer when You See Someone in Your Family in Pain

#### When Those More Distant from Us Suffer, We Are less Concerned

#### When Our Enemies Suffer, We May Have no Concern at All or even Take Pleasure in Their Suffering

##### This is a Bad Practice to Be Eliminated

#### You Should Learn to Have Equanimity with Compassion Doling it out Equally to Everyone

### Pure Compassion is not Mixed with Attachment

### Pure Compassion is the Desire for All Beings to Be Happy and Free from Suffering

## The opposite of Compassion

### Harmfulness

#### Harmfulness is the Wish for other People to Suffer

#### The opposite of Compassion

#### The Intent to Harm Arises from Anger, Jealousy, and Attachment

##### When We Are Angry at Someone, It's Common to want to Harm that Person, Take Revenge, want Them to Hurt and Suffer

##### Under the Influence of Jealousy, We want to See Others Suffer Misfortune or Lose the Possessions They Value

##### Out of Attachment, We May want to See Others come to Harm so that We Can Obtain Their Possessions, Perhaps by Force

#### The Desire to Harm Others Should Be Completely Abandoned in favor of Compassion

### Retaliation

#### Retaliation is the Culmination and Fulfillment of the Desire to Cause Harm

#### If the Desire to Cause Harm is not Eliminated, it Blossoms into Retaliation

#### It's also the opposite of Compassion, even the Destroyer of it

### Schadenfreude

#### Schadenfreude is a German Word that Describes the Desire to Take Pleasure in the Suffering of Another Being

#### Schadenfreude is Similar to Harmfulness in that it Directly Opposes Compassion and Should Be Abandoned

#### It Differs from Harmfulness in that We Don't Necessarily want to Cause the Harm

##### We just want to Take Pleasure in the Harm That's Occurring

#### Appeals to Personal Justice Are Often Tainted with Schadenfreude

##### Is Someone Harms Us, We May Seek Justice,

##### But Often We Take a Satisfaction in the Administration of Justice because the Harm Inflicted on the Perpetrators

### Jealousy, Anger, and Resentment Aren't Direct Opposites of Compassion, but They Hinder Our Ability to Feel Compassion

## Practice Feeling Compassion for Those You Resent

### Resentments Are Anger Kept Ablaze

#### The Desire for Revenge Naturally Follows from Anger and Resentment

#### The Commitment to Non-retaliation Weakens the Desire to Harm Others

#### The People Who Are the Objects of Your Resentments Are Your Enemies

#### Eliminating Resentments means Abandoning Your Feelings of Anger toward Your Enemies

### Nurturing Feelings of Compassion for Your Enemies Will Eliminate Resentment Entirely

## Practice Taking the Sufferings of Others onto Yourself

### One of the Most Powerful and Cleansing Meditations is to Imagine Taking on the Suffering of Others

#### This Meditation Increases Your Empathy and Compassion

#### Helps Facilitate Exchanging Yourself with Another

### Expand the Circle of People whose Suffering You Take on

#### Can You Feel the Suffering of Your Spouse or other Children?

#### Can You Feel the Suffering of Your Extended Family?

#### Can You Feel the Suffering of Your Friends and Acquaintances?

#### I Wish for All People to Be Happy and Free from Suffering All the time

##### I Must Help People Alleviate Their Suffering

### I Feel the Suffering of All Helpless Children

#### I Can Alleviate the Suffering of Special Needs Children by Doing what They Can not

#### I Will Bring and End to the Suffering of All Helpless Children

#### I want All Special Needs Children to Live a Life of Love, Acceptance, and Happiness

# Manifesting Kindness as a way of Life
