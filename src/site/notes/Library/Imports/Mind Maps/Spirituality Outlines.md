# Selfless

# Selfless Life Posts

## We Hold These Truths to Be Self-evident

### List of Intuitions

#### Our Perceptions Are Limited by Our Individual Body and Mind

#### We Experience an Endless Stream of Experiences while Conscious

#### Our Experiences Are Private and not Shared by Others

#### Our Existence Had a Beginning and Will Have an End

#### We Are a "self" that Exists Independent of the Mind and Body

#### The Self is an Observer of Experience and the Possessor of a Body and Mind

#### The Self Has Volitional Control of Decision Making

### A Persistent Awareness Exists

#### The Awareness is Input Linked to Perceptual Systems

#### The Perceptual Systems Are Confined to a "body" Isolated in Space and time

#### Awareness Combined with Memory Creates Our Sense of time and Existence

##### To Exist is to Exist as Something from One Moment to the next

##### Without Awareness, there Would Be Nothing to Remember

##### Without Memory, there Would Be no Cognition of Awareness

### Awareness is Aware of It's Own Activity and Existence

#### Awareness of Awareness Creates a Strong Sense of Self

##### Awareness of Awareness is the Basic Function of Consciousness

###### Aka Conscious Awareness

##### Subject and Object

###### The Object Observed is the Act of Observing

###### One Instance where Subject and Object Are One

Distinction built into the English language

Deeply held intuition

##### Often Erroneously Called "self awareness"

##### Posits the "self" Exists as that Something that is Aware

##### This is Innate Self-grasping

##### Awareness is the Observation and Consciousness is the Observer

#### Conscious Awareness Has Limitations

##### Perceptual System provide Limited Input on the "outside" Environment

##### Creates a Sense of Self and Not-self

##### The Self Feels Distinct from It's Environment though it Can Interact with it

#### Conscious Awareness Has Privileged Access

##### Information not Directly Shareable with Others

###### The Perceived Observer is Separated from the Environment

###### Loneliness and Isolation

##### Root of All Subjective Experience

##### We Share a Common Environmental Existence but We Do not Share Individual Experiences of that Common Environment

#### The Awareness and Isolation Create Strong Intuitions of a Separate Observer and Possessor

### Conscious Awareness Provides a Strong Sense of Separation from the Body and Mind

#### Intuition is that the Body is the Possessed and Consciousness is the Possessor

#### The Possessor and Observer Feel like there is an Object, a "you" that is Distinct, Separate, and "real"

##### It Feels like This "you" Exists Independently of the Body, Brain, and Perceptual Systems it Interacts with

##### "you" Believe You Are Your Consciousness

### Conscious Awareness Exercises Some Degree of Volitional Control over the Activities of the Body and Mind

#### A Strong Sense of Self and Self-determination

#### Volitional Control is the Primary Reason Consciousness Exists at All

## Key Features of Mind

### Consciousness

#### Awareness is the Root of Consciousness

##### Awareness is the First Principal of Life

##### Without Awareness Nothing Else Exists

#### Consciousness is the Subjective Personal Experience of the Activity of Mind

#### Consciousness is an Emergent Property, a Depth of Awareness Capable of Recognizing It's Own Activity

#### Discrimination

#### Contact

#### Meaning

#### Feeling

#### Association

#### Memory

#### Energy

#### Volition

### Ways to Organize Features of Mind

#### Dependent Relationship

##### Representation Emanates from and Depends on Observation and Illation

##### Association Relies upon Memory

#### Features with Corresponding Brain Regions or Structures

#### Features of Process

##### Direct Attention to Improve Observation

##### Energy to Move Attention to the Most Important Task or Thought

##### Contact Never Remains Constant, Always in Motion from Object to Object

##### Volition is an Activity of Decision, Signals Change in Behavior

#### Infrastructure versus Process

##### Body

##### Sensory Systems

##### Brain

##### Mind

##### Representation

#### Capabilities Required to Make Consciousness Function

##### Representation and the Features Required for Representation, Observation and Illation

##### Attention

##### Discrimination

##### Feeling

##### Ability to Discern Meaning. Hard Problem of Consciousness

##### Association and Its Required Feature, Memory

#### Action Required to Activate the System

##### Contact

##### Energy to provide Action

##### Volition, the Purpose of Consciousness

### Observation

### Illation

### Representation

#### Representation is the Assembly of Sense Data and Expectation to Present the Mind's Best Guess as to what Exists outside the Mind

##### The Mind Starts with Processed Sense Data

##### The Mind Feeds back Missing Data Based on Memory of Similar Experiences

##### Re-presents Reality to the Mind

##### Distorted by Delusions and Misperceptions

#### Experienced as an Inner Theater by an Emergent Observer

##### Strong Sense of Observer and Thing Observed

###### Deep Intuition

###### Innate Self Grasping

##### Conscious Awareness Has Privileged Access

###### Information not Directly Shareable with Others

The perceived observer is separated from the environment

Loneliness and isolation

###### Root of All Subjective Experience

###### We Share a Common Environmental Existence but We Do not Share Individual Experiences of that Common Environment

##### Root of All Subjective Experience - Qualia

#### We React to This Re-presentation as if It's a 100% Accurate Recreation of the outside World

##### We Believe the World "out there" Exists as Our Mind Represents it

##### We Believe Our Concepts and Associations Reveal an Underlying Reality

##### We Fail to See that Our Representations Are Created by Sense Data and Mind

##### Our Concepts Are not Present in the outside World, but Believe the Characteristics or Features Are in the Objects when They Are only in Our Minds.

###### Concepts provide Context for All Our Experiences.

###### Sense Data is only a Small part of the Experience.

###### "truths" About Life Circumstances only Exist in the Mind.

#### Representation is Often Mistaken

##### Incomplete Sense Data

##### Incorrect "best guess" provided by Mind

##### False Associations

##### Delusions

#### Mistaken Representation Leads to Poor Decisions and Negative Outcomes

### Attention

#### Attention is the Capacity to Focus on an Aspect or Feature of the Representation of Awareness,

##### Without Attention, the Representation of Awareness is Useless

##### Attention is Focused on an Object or part of an Object the Mind is in contact with

##### Attention Can Focus on Any Object of Discrimination including Parts of the Whole

#### Attention Can Be Directed by Volition (choice)

##### Volition Can Add or Subtract Feeling to Conflicting Desires

##### All Concentration is Directed Attention

#### Attention Can Be Focused on the Past, Present or Future

##### When Focused on the Present, Decisions about Behavior Can Be Made

##### When Attention is Focused on the Future, contact Imagines Events or Sets Intention

##### When Attention is Focused on the Past, contact Relies upon Memory Recall

#### Attention is Driven by Energy and Feeling from One Object or Thought to the next

##### The Largest Feeling Draws the Most Attention

##### Consciousness Can Move through Attention to Devote More Resources to an Object of Contact.

### Discrimination

#### Discrimination Distinguishes One Object from Another

##### Discrimination Creates Mental Objects

###### Mental Objects Are the Basic Unit of Information and Meaning

###### Mental Objects Collect and Store Associations

##### Discrimination is the Basis of All Thoughts and Concepts

##### Discrimination Recognizes the Unique Characteristics of an Object

##### Discrimination Defines the Boundary of what is and is not an Object

##### Discrimination Relies on Meaning to Identify an Object's Characteristics or Parts

#### Discrimination Creates Data for Decision Making

##### Necessary Skill for Survival of the Organism

###### Survival Requires Acquisition and Consumption of Resources

###### Survival Requires Avoiding Dangers

###### Must Be Able to Distinguish Important Resources from Danger

##### Without the Ability to Discriminate Objects, the Organism Would not Survive

#### Discriminations Are Empty of Inherent Existence

##### Our Mind Conceptualizes This Differently

##### Our Mind Conceptualizes Distinct Objects with Specific Properties

##### These Properties and Objects Appear to Exist from Their Own Side

##### These Properties Are not in the Objects but Solely in Our Minds

### Contact

#### Contact Occurs when a Mind is Focused with Directed Attention on a Specific Object of Discrimination

#### Contact is a Process

##### Upon Contact, the Mind Generates Feelings and Meanings, Associates Them with the Object, and Remembers the Experience

##### Through Judgment, the Mind Generates Feelings about the Object that Are Pleasant, Unpleasant or Neutral.

##### The Mind Consults Memory for Previous Associations

##### The Mind Searches for Meaning or Concepts to Explain the Object

##### The Mind Creates or Updates Associations and Saves Them in Memory

#### Contact is the Basic Unit of Experience

##### Contact is the Perception of an Object in a Moment in time

##### The Mind is Always in contact with an Object with Focused Attention

##### Contact is Always in Motion from One Object to Another with Energy

##### Contact is the Unifying Experience where the other Features of Consciousness come together

#### The Energetic Movement of Mind from Object to Object is Perceived as a Stream of Consciousness

##### The Movement of Mind is Recorded with Memory as Moment-to-moment Experience

##### The Persistence of Memory of Private Experience Creates the Sense of an Observer that We Grasp at as a Truly Existent Self.

### Meaning

#### The Meaning We Associate with Objects Arises from Concepts

#### Without Meaning, We Couldn't Understand Objects and Make Decisions

#### Meanings Include All Characteristics, Features, Categories, Generalizations We Associate with an Object

#### Meaning Provides Tools for Sharper and More Nuanced Discriminations and Better Decisions

#### Meaning Generates Feelings Forming Feedback Loops

#### Meaning is Generated by Mind, not by the Objects Themselves

#### Meaning is the Hard Problem of Consciousness

##### How Does This Happen?

##### It Goes Wrong in Autism

### Feeling

#### Feeling is a Method of Assigning a Measured Importance to Objects through Association

##### Not All Facts Are Created Equal

##### Some Facts Are More Important than Others

##### Feelings Can Vary Considerably in Intensity Based on Assigned Importance

#### Feeling Can Be Pleasant, Unpleasant or Neutral

##### This Has Survival Value

##### Some Objects Pull You in

##### Some Objects Push You away

##### Some Objects Waste Your Energy with Investigation

#### Feeling is what Determines Which Thoughts Are Presented to the Stream of Consciousness

##### You Think the Thought with the Strongest Feeling

##### Related Thoughts Carry Related Feelings

##### Trains of Thoughts United by Feeling is part of Meditation

#### Feeling is what is Measured in Decision Making

##### Pros and Cons Weigh against One Another

##### Feeling Influences Motivation and Urgency to Act

#### Feelings Accumulate through Multiple Associations

#### Changing Feelings about Objects with Many Associations Takes time to Integrate into Daily Life

#### Changing Feelings is the Benefit and Practice of Object Meditation

##### Use Associations and Contemplations to Bring up Feelings

##### Let the Feeling Permeate the Mind and Sink into Every Association that Touches it

### Association

#### Association is the Ability to Attach Characteristics to Objects of contact

##### Name and Form

##### Feelings Are Associated with Objects

##### Relationships to other Objects though Categorization and Shared Labels

##### Associations Leverage the Power of Categorization and Stereotyping to Build up Knowledge about Objects

##### Associations Make Discriminations Meaningful

##### All Associations Are Empty of Inherent Existence

#### Without Association, no Object Would Carry Any Meaning or Importance

### Memory is how the Information is Retained for Later Recall and Decision Making

#### Memory is the Continuity of Experience over time

#### Memory is Essential to Personal Identity

##### People Use Memory to Construct a Narrative Self

#### Memory Points to Two other Facts of Existence

##### "you" Have an Earliest Memory

###### Memory Has a Beginning, so Existence Has a Beginning

###### There Was a time when You Did not Exist

##### "you" Will Have a Final Memory

###### Life Does not Continue Forever

###### There Will Be a time when "you" Will not Exist Again

#### With Awareness and Memory Comes the Strong Intuition of a Limited Existence

### Energy

### Volition

#### Volition is the Function of Consciousness that Weighs out Alternatives and Determines a Course of Action

#### The Internal Decision Maker

# Problem Solving

## Instructions

### Place to Brainstorm

### Flow of Ideas

### Like a Chalkboard

### No Relationship to other Maps

### Can Incorporate back into other Maps as Necessary

### How to Archive?

#### Problems come in at Random

#### No Organization in Chronology

##### A Chronological Structure May Still Be a Good way to Archive

![](<Incubator/Imports/Mind Maps/Attachment 4.png>)

###### Keeps a Record of Mind Flow

![](<Incubator/Imports/Mind Maps/Attachment 5.png>)

###### Like a Diary

###### Difficult to Find Old Work

![](<Incubator/Imports/Mind Maps/Attachment 6.png>)

##### Maybe Organization is not Necessary

#### By Topic?

![](<Incubator/Imports/Mind Maps/Attachment 7.png>)

##### To Difficult to Define

##### Each Problem is Different

##### Characteristics Vary Too much

## Idea and Feeling Organization

### The Contemplation Should Be Three Ideas

#### The Mind Can Hold Three Ideas at One time

##### Or less

##### One Powerful Idea Can Be Enough

#### Each One Relates to the Others

#### May Be Enhancers as well

### The Idea Must Be a Single, Clearly Defined Feeling

#### The Clarity of the Definition here is Important

#### Object Clarity is Always a Problem

## Accepting Christ as Savior

### Entry to the Path

#### Mediation 1

#### Foundational

### Questions to Ponder

#### What is Christ?

#### What is Acceptance?

#### Why Should People Accept Christ?

#### Why Do People Actually Accept Christ? (is there a Difference between the "should" and the "do"?)

#### How Does Someone Recognize if They've Accepted Christ? (do People Fake It? And, is Faking it until You Make it bad?)

#### How Do People Know if They Haven't Accepted Christ? (is there Confusion and uncertainty?)

#### What Happens to People Who Don't Accept Christ? (other than Going to hell)

#### Why Don't People Accept Christ? (we Need a List of objections)

#### What is Faith?

#### What is the Role of Faith?

#### Can You Accept Christ part Way? Can Faith Build over Time, or is it an All-or-nothing Affair?

#### Is lack of Faith a Barrier to Accepting Christ? How is This Overcome?

#### What Did Jesus Die For?

#### What is the Forgiveness of Sins?

#### What is Being Forgiven?

#### What Does it Mean to Be Forgiven?

#### What is Salvation?

#### What Does it Mean to Be Truly Saved?

### Why Should Someone want to Accept Christ as Savior?

#### These Are the Gateways

#### How Do the Gateways to the Path Open?

#### Document and Explain the Reasons

## What is Prayer?

### Prayer is Generally Conceived as Talking to God

#### People Talk, God Listens, but God Does not Respond

#### Talking to God is only Half of Prayer

#### God Actually Responds through the Feelings One Gets when Praying

##### The Holy Spirit Acts through Feeling

### Prayer is Really a Conversation with God

#### Thinking is Talking to God

##### All Thinking is Talking to God as God Knows Every Thought

###### God Notices Non-virtuous Thought

###### God's Attention Span is Unlimited

###### Live as if God is Listening to Every Thought, Word, and Deed

God can't be excluded from any part of life

Prayer is a 24/7 endeavor

God listens even when people don't want god to hear

Perhaps especially when people don't want god to hear

People behave as if they think god isn't paying attention

##### Directing Attention to God is a Special Form of Prayer

###### Directing Attention to God is a Special Virtuous State

###### God Delights in Our Focused Attention on Him

###### We Need to Be Open to God's Response

Pay attention to our feelings

#### Feeling is God Responding

##### Where Do Feelings come From?

###### Feelings Do not Arise at the Request of Consciousness

###### Feelings Can Persist despite Our Desires for Them to Stop

###### Feelings Are not under Conscious Control

###### Feelings Are not Yours

###### Feelings Are Thoughts Experienced in the Body

###### Feelings Can Be the Activity of the Holy Spirit

##### Most Feelings come from Our Impure Minds

###### Our Feelings Arise in Response to Our Thoughts and Beliefs

###### Our Selfish Desires Dominate Our Feelings

###### Our Selfish Feelings Are Loud and Demanding

##### Action of the Holy Spirit

###### Holy Spirit Empowers Us once We Accept Christ

###### We Hear the Holy Spirit when We Engage in Virtuous Thinking

###### We Hear Our Impure Mind when We Engage in Non-virtuous Thinking

###### The Holy Spirit Speaks in Quiet Tones

##### We Must Learn to Discern Our Feelings

###### We Need to Learn the Non-virtuous States Generated by Impure Minds

###### We Need to Cultivate Virtuous States Generated by the Holy Spirit

###### This is the Goal of Spiritual Training

### Making Requests of God

#### God Responds to All Prayers

##### Sometimes the Answer is no

###### We Must Have Faith God Knows Best

###### We Don't Know what is Good or Bad

##### Sometimes the Answer is Yes

###### Yes, but not Necessarily the way We Asked for it

###### Yes, but not now

##### Our Judgments about God's Response is Generally Wrong

###### God is not Our Personal Wish Fulfilling Jewel or Magic Genie

###### God is not a Concierge, Useful for Obtaining Objects of Desire

###### God is not an Executioner Smiting Our Enemies (despite what the Old Testament says)

#### Non-virtuous Requests

##### Requests for Personal Gain Could Go either way

###### Requests for Personal Gain at expense of Another is Root of Non-virtue

###### Request for Help in times of Distress or Need is Virtuous

##### Any Request where Someone Else is Harmed is Non-virtuous

###### Harms Can Be Gross or Subtle

###### Getting Resources Meant for Another is Non-virtuous

Praying for the desired outcome of a sporting event

Praying to win the lottery

###### Requesting God to Make Others Change Their Behavior to Suit Our Needs

God is not your personal slave master

##### Any Request Likely to Lead Us to More Non-virtuous Thinking or Behavior

###### A Prayer for Drugs and Intoxicants

###### Prayers for Any Object of Desirous Attachment

###### Prayers for Violence or Aversion

#### Virtuous Requests

##### Personal Requests for Refuge

###### The only Selfish Personal Request

###### Help to Know God Better and Enjoy His Blessings

###### Help Remove Defilements from My Mind

###### Help Lessen the Bad Feelings Associated with Negative Mind States

##### Any Request that Springs from Compassion

###### God Will Help Most when the Request is a Sincere Desire to Help Others

###### Lovingkindness

###### Giving Our virtue to Others

##### Wishing Others to Be Happy and Free from Suffering

### Setting Intention through Prayer

#### Prayer when the Results Are not Immediate or the Effect is Long-term

#### The Biological Basis for Our Unsatisfactory Lives

#### Rewrite the Biology post from a Christian Perspective

##### Original Sin instead of Evolutionary Biology

###### The Need to Survive Was Built into God's Creation

God used some of the same design features in humans as other animals

Without these instinctual reactions, humanity would not have been fruitful and multiplied.

###### The Need to Survive Leads to Self-importance

###### Collective Wisdom as also Built in

The bliss of compassion is our connection with god and the collective

This naturally shines through when self-importance does not arise

Less fleeting than pleasures of the self

#### People Were Equipped by God or Nature to Survive

##### System of Punishments and Rewards to Drive Survival Behavior

###### Obtaining Resources Brings Pleasure

###### Avoiding Dangerous Situations Reduces Pain

###### Ignoring Situations that Are neither Pleasurable or Dangerous Saves Energy

##### Survival Systems Create Automatic Responses

###### Seek More of Pleasurable Items or Experiences

###### Avoid Harmful or Unpleasant Experiences

###### Ignore Information that is not a Source of Pleasure or Pain

##### Automatic Responses Lead to Suffering

###### Grasping at Pleasure Leads to Attachment

###### Aversion to Pain Leads to Anger and Hatred

Opposite of self-cherishing

##### Selflessness

###### There is Hope for Us

###### Selfless Actions Benefiting Others is the Key to Happiness and Peace of Mind

### Cause of Suffering

#### How the Mind Works

##### Body, Brain, Mind, and Consciousness

###### Definitions and Distinctions

###### Your Body is Composed of Your Brain, Sense Organs and the Supporting Bones, Muscles, and Organs Necessary for Life

###### Your Brain is the Interwoven part of the Body that Processes Sense Data.

###### Body and Mind Are Physical

###### Mind and Consciousness Are not Physical

###### Your Mind Emerges from the Activity of the Brain

Your mind functions to convert electrical impulses on the brains neural network into concepts that apprehend objects

The mind perceives objects

The mind knows the object it perceives

###### Your Consciousness Emerges from the Activity of the Mind

Consciousness functions to focus mental activity

Consciousness influences decision making and behavior

###### Body, Brain, Mind, and Consciousness Are Dependent Related Phenomenon

Body and brain generate mind

Mind depends on body and brain

Mind generates consciousness

Consciousness depends on mind, which depends on body and brain

##### Physical Properties of the Brain

###### Your Brain is a Small Lump of Fleshy Material Encased in a Durable Bony Cover for Its Protection

###### Your Body is Equipped with Sense Organs that Relay Information to the Brain about the outside World

###### Your Body and Brain Are Interconnected in Ways that Can't Be Separated

Sense organs are really extensions of the brain throughout the body

The entire nervous system is part of the brain

###### Your Brain Gathers the Information from Sense Experience in the Form of Electrical Impulses Transmitted among Neural Pathways

###### Your Brain is an Organized Collection of Neurons, Chemicals, and other Items that Form a Complex Network

###### Your Body and Brain provide Infrastructure Necessary for Mind and Consciousness to Function

##### The Brain Functions like a Quantum Computer

###### The Computer Analogy

Brain acts like computer hardware

Mind is like computer software

###### Your Brain Processes Information at Tremendous Speed

###### A Complex Neural Network Increases the Number of Thoughts the Mind Can Process Simultaneously

###### Your Brain is a Processor of Thoughts and Sense Data

###### The Meaning in the Data Comes from the Mind

##### The Mind Emerges from the Activity of the Neural Network in the Brain

###### Your Mind Actively Participates in Creating the Perception of Reality

Your body provides sense data

Your brain actively fills in missing detail

The mind can alter sense data

Attaches additional information

Generates feedback loops

Mind can generate sense experience

The mind is a sixth sense organ

###### Your Mind Assembles Everything into a Larger Concept of Reality

Mind is not physical

Electrical impulses in the brain generate mind

Can mind exist without a brain?

Question for metaphysics

Not in the physical world

The hard problem of consciousness

Nobody knows how this occurs

##### The Mind Imputes Reality onto and from the Activity of the Brain

###### Your Mind Generates a Coherent Picture of the World outside of Itself

Theater of the mind

Essential for survival

Needed to obtain resources and avoid dangers

###### Your Mind Generates and Organizes Reality in order to Make Decisions about Behavior

Your mind generates concepts to organize reality

Necessary and useful function of the mind

Basic concepts are required for survival

Concepts are building blocks of all communication

We live in a conceptualized reality

Reality is 1% sense data and 99% mental concepts

There is no reality outside the mind

###### Your Mind Must Deal with the Problem of Information Overload

Your mind generates and processes far more information than it needs

The social gathering analogy

Many conversations occur at one time

How to chose which conversation to listen to?

#### The Need for Consciousness

##### The Mind is Constantly Bombarded with Packages of Information on Objects in the outside World

###### All the Data Processed by the Mind is not Equally Important

Acting on some data and not others is key to survival

The mind needs a mechanism to discern which data to act on

The mind needs consciousness to direct awareness, interpret information, and formulate decisions

##### Consciousness Emerges from the Mind's Need to Organize and React to Thought and Sense Data

###### Your Brain is Capable of Processing Many Thought Objects at the Same time

###### Parallel Thought Processing Necessitates Awareness

It doesn't help to process more than one thought at a time if you mind can't monitor them

Your mind must have the ability to monitor all your thoughts

The larger the number of thoughts, the more important awareness becomes

###### The Faculty of Awareness is also One of the Thoughts Processes in the Mind

###### When the Neural Network Gets Large Enough, the Awareness of the Activity of the Mind Become Aware of Itself

##### Your Conscious Mind Can only Focus on a Small Fraction of the Total Input Your Mind Processes

###### Creates Distinction between the Consciousness State and Sub-consciousness State

Your subconscious mind contains all the thoughts your conscious mind is not directly aware of

Subconscious thoughts exist below the level of emotional importance required to reach conscious awareness

99%+ of thinking is subconscious

###### These Are not Two Minds but rather Two States of the Same Mind

The mind is simultaneously processing hundreds of thoughts and sense impressions

Consciousness is an awareness that rides on top of mental processing

Consciousness is not in any way separate from the mental processing the mind is doing

##### Your Conscious Mind Must Pick and Choose Which Objects to Pay Attention to and Which Ones to Ignore

###### Consciousness is the Mental Process of Focusing Attention to What's Most Important

###### Your Subconscious Mind Processes the Vast Majority of the Information Sent to Your Mind

###### Your Mind Uses Feeling and Emotion to Determine what Needs to Be Sent to the Conscious Mind for Further Consideration and Action

#### Functions of Consciousness

##### Awareness and Cognition

###### Essence of Subjective Experience

###### A lack of Awareness is a Characteristic of Unconsciousness, Death, and Non-existence

###### Indisputable Fact of Existence

You can be mistaken about everything you perceive

You can't be mistaken that you perceive

###### Awareness is the point of contact with All Experience

Awareness is a function of the body and brain

Cognition is a function of the mind

Cognition is the knowing that emerges from awareness

Awareness and cognition encompass all the sense processing to create the complete package of information

Awareness and cognition are inseparable

Awareness without cognition is useless information

Awareness is required in order for cognition to take place

Must be cognizant of something

Even in sensory deprivation, there is awareness of mental processes

###### The Purpose of Awareness and Cognition is to provide Information to Consciousness to Make Decisions about Future Behavior

##### Volition

###### Awareness Serves no Function if it Does not Serve Free Will

We have free will

It determines less than we think

Free will is how consciousness tips the balance

Willpower has limits

###### People Must Make Choices to Survive

###### Volition is the Process of Consideration of Information from Awareness and the subsequent Determination of a Course of Action

Volition is not as under the control of the conscious mind as most people think

Consciousness serves the secondary function of rationalization and public relations in service of the ego

##### Volition Can Direct Awareness

###### Mental Focus or Concentration

Short term direction of awareness

Direct conscious awareness

###### Intention

Long term direction of awareness

Taps into power of subconscious processing

#### Levels of Awareness

##### What is Meant by a Level of Awareness?

###### Consciousness Contains the Awareness of Mental Activity

###### Different Levels of Awareness of Inner Activity of the Mind

###### Four Levels of Consciousness Based on Increasing Awareness

##### No Mental Awareness at All

###### Level 1 Awareness

###### Limited Environmental Awareness

###### Simple Life Forms

###### Pure Stimulus and Response

##### No Awareness of Awareness

###### Level 2 Awareness

###### Sufficient Brain Complexity Required to Coordinate Biological Systems

###### Animal Realm

###### Limited Decision Making

###### Use of Memory

###### Beyond Pure Stimulus and Response

##### Awareness of Awareness

###### Level 3 Awareness

###### Sufficient Brain Complexity that Awareness Becomes Aware of Itself

###### Aka "self" Awareness

###### Small Subset of Animals Have This Capacity

###### Humans Are not the only Animals with Awareness of Awareness

##### Direct Observation of the Activity of Awareness

###### Level 4 Awareness

###### Ability to Observe Conscious Mental Activity

###### Observing the Voice in the Head as a Feature of Mind

###### Dis-identification with the Activity of the Mind

###### Abandonment of Self Identity

###### Unattached Observer Perspective

###### Heightened Awareness of Internal Bodily Activity

###### Ability to Observe and Influence Autonomic Functions

###### Aware of Awareness Watching Awareness

#### Your Mind's Radar System

##### Reticular Activating System

###### Special Hardware Built into the Brain

##### Mind Scans Sense Data from the Environment

###### Most Sense Data is Meaningless

###### Important Information Must Be Found in the Noise

##### Essential to Survival

###### Maximizes Mental Efficiency

###### Increased Sensitivity to Useful Resources

###### Increased Sensitivity to Danger

###### Moves Focus away from Meaningless Objects

##### Cause of Suffering if Left Untrained

###### Seeks to Obtain Objects of Attachment

###### Seeks to Avoid Objects of Aversion

##### Can Be Directed by Consciousness

###### Concentration and Intention

###### Purpose of Spiritual Training

#### What Consciousness is Aware of

##### How the Mind Processes Ordinary Experience

###### Packages of Mind Data Are Created

Repetitive thoughts are a form of mind data

Contacts with new objects creates fresh sense data

###### The Information is Pre-processed by the Sense Organs

###### The Processed Information is Sent to the Brain

###### The Brain Fills in Any Missing Data from past Experience

###### The Mind Assembles Information on the Object

Takes inputs from multiple sense organs

Compares to memories and expectations

###### Mind Creates a Coherent Picture of Reality

Needed for survival

Distortions would inhibit gathering resources or avoiding dangers

Theater of the mind

###### The Mind Reacts to the Object as either Positive, Negative, or Neutral

Survival instinct

Automated response

###### The Reaction to the Object is Packaged along with the Sense Data into a Complete Experience of the Object

##### Emotions Are a Reaction to a Thought or Sense Data

###### Emotional Reactions to Previous Thoughts Creates Fresh Mind Data

###### This New Thought Causes a New Emotional Reaction.

###### Thoughts Causing Reactions Causing Thoughts Causing Reactions

##### Your Mind Evaluates Each Object Package and Assigns an Emotional Weight

###### These Emotional Weights Are Based on past Experience and prior Mental Training

###### Thoughts Are Compared to other Thoughts and Beliefs

Related thoughts change the emotional weights

Emotions can intensify or weaken the initial reaction

The sum of all supporting and related thoughts

###### The Original Package of Sense Data is Altered to Include Any Thoughts and Emotional Reactions

##### The Mind Constantly and Simultaneously Creates, Modifies, and Evaluates Countless Mental Packages

###### New Sense Experience

###### Previous Thoughts, Feelings, and Sense Experiences

###### Thoughts Are Related and Compared to other Thoughts

###### These Interactions Serve to Increase or Decrease Emotional Weight

###### Thoughts Become a Bundle of Related Thoughts with Accumulated Emotional Weight

##### The Collection of Thoughts, Feelings and Sense Data with the Largest Emotional Weight is what Consciousness is Aware of

###### The Largest Emotional Weight is the Minds way of Determining Importance

###### This Selection Process Happens at a Sub-conscious Level below Your Ordinary Awareness

The seemingly random stream of thoughts sent to conscious awareness is one of the first things people observe when they start mediating

###### Consciousness Can Influence This Emotional Weighting Process

Your conscious mind can only influence this process, not direct it

This is the root of all decision making

Consciousness is informed of decisions

It isn't the decision maker

###### The Most Important Mind Issue Requires the Special Faculties of Consciousness

##### The Purpose of Spiritual Practice is the Change the Emotional Weights Associated with Thoughts and Sense Data.

###### Changing the Intensity of These Emotional Weights is the Purpose of Object Meditation and the Reason for Its Effectiveness

#### Consciousness and Decision Making

##### Willpower is an Illusion

###### Willpower is not a Muscle that Can Be Exercised

Determination is a minor boost

Concentration is a minor boost

Interlinked emotional weights associated with thought is much stronger

###### Consciousness is not an Absolute Authority

Addiction proves the no amount of willpower to determination in the conscious mind can control what people actually do

Attempt stop thinking through force of will

Don't see the color blue

Consciousness can't even accomplish that

###### Consciousness Can only Influence Decisions by providing Emotional Weight

One of the many factors that create the total emotional weight

###### Consciousness is the Servant of the Mind

Thoughts and feelings interact below conscious awareness

Thoughts must interact and pick up importance before consciousness becomes aware of it

Thoughts in consciousness have deep roots

Thoughts and beliefs interact to build importance

No thought stands alone

The endless churning of thoughts and emotional associations determines everything

Behaviors are chosen by competing thoughts and feelings

Attitude toward behaviors are similarly chosen

##### Emotional Suppression Fails over time

###### Willpower Can Succeed in Suppressing Thoughts in the short Term

###### Too Many Supporting Links Giving the Thought Power

The irresistible force

Focuses undue attention

Makes matters worse

###### The Thought Recurs with the Same or Greater Emotional Intensity

Thoughts can only me undermined, not suppressed

##### Who or what is Really in Charge?

###### Consciousness Can Tip the Balance in Making Decisions

Degree of volition

Determinism versus free will

###### The Mind is like a Parliament or a Lynch Mob Depending on the Circumstances

In ordinary circumstances, consciousness retains a semblance of order and guiding control over behavior

We have some degree of free will and autonomy

There are limits to our conscious control

In extreme circumstances, other mental scripts may take over and direct behavior toward a survival end

Survival scripts can be triggered by events that don't actually threaten survival

This causes much non-virtuous behavior

Bouts of anger and rage or extreme jealousy

We can learn to direct the various emotional forces behind the decision making process.

In this manner, we direct decisions by redirecting the mob

###### Consciousness is like a Prime Minister

Can negotiate compromises between competing thoughts or values

Can set the mental agenda through power of intention

Consciousness is not the all-powerful dictator people believe it is

###### Most Decision Making is Actually Made without the Advice or Consent of Consciousness

##### Consciousness Explains and Rationalizes after the Fact

###### Consciousness Evaluates and Affirms Previous Decisions

Evaluation is rarely unbiased

Evaluation is based on self-serving criteria

###### Consciousness Provides Public Relations both Internally and Externally

###### Hypocrisy and Rationalization

##### Directing Decision Making Requires Changing the Emotional Weights Assigned to the Thoughts Churning in Your Mind

#### How Consciousness Creates Suffering

##### The Results of Mental Focus

###### Mental Focus Can Create Happiness or Suffering

What you focus on

Amount of time spent

###### What You Focus on

Virtue versus non-virtue

Pleasant versus unpleasant

Worry versus joy

###### Percent of time Spent

Simple measure

Pie chart with three areas

Good

Bad

Neither

Reveals depth of suffering

##### Virtuous and Non-virtuous Minds

###### What Distinguishes virtue from Non-virtue?

All non-virtuous minds are generated by self-grasping and self-cherishing (self-importance)

All virtuous minds are generated by the desire to cherish others

###### Non-virtuous Minds

Non virtuous minds are the easiest to describe and relate to

They are the easiest to generate and maintain

They come naturally

They are self-sustaining

Types of non-virtuous minds

Anger

Attachment

Delusion

Non-virtuous minds are always a source of suffering

###### Virtuous Minds

Virtuous minds can never be the source of suffering

Virtuous minds do not come naturally and must be cultivated

##### Consciousness either Creates virtue and Happiness or Non-virtue and Suffering

###### Consciousness is the Awareness of the End State of an Ongoing Process of Thoughts and Feelings Interacting

###### Consciousness Merely Reacts to the Thoughts and Feelings Generated by Mind

###### Computer Programming Analogy

Garbage in, garbage out

Consciousness builds on the raw materials provided by mind

Bad inputs lead to bad outputs

###### Cultivating Virtuous Minds is Preferable

###### All Suffering Comes from Creating and Sustaining Non-virtuous Minds

### Cessation of Suffering

#### What about Me?

##### I Think; Therefore, I Am

###### Awareness and Cognition Do not Require an "I"

###### Most People Impute an "I" onto Their Thought Process

Leads to innate self-grasping

Leads to the false impression of intrinsic existence

###### Why Do You Have a Voice in Your Head?

Wouldn't you already know what you think?

What is the purpose of restating these thoughts in your mind?

If you were your thoughts, you would not need to talk to yourself

###### Who or what is Listening to the Voice in the Head?

If someone or something else, then the voice is not "you"

###### You Are not Your Thoughts

Thinking is merely a function of mind, a tool

Thinking is not directly within the control of consciousness

Consciousness is an observer of thought

Consciousness can direct thought

Consciousness doesn't actually produce thought

##### Where Am I in Body, Brain, Mind, and Consciousness?

###### Are You Your Body?

Your body is necessary to provide a brain and sustain life processes

Your body is a useful tool

Possessor and the possessed are not the same entity

Your body is not you

###### Are You Your Brain?

Your brain is necessary to provide the infrastructure to generate mind

Your brain is merely a part of your body, inseparable from it

Your brain is not you

###### Are You Your Mind?

Your mind emerges from the activity of the body and brain

There is no mind without a body and brain

There is no documented case of a mind existing without a brain

If it were possible, we would have found one

Your mind has tremendous power due to the computing power of the brain

Your mind processes a great deal of information that consciousness is not aware of

If you are your mind, you don't know 99% of who you are

Are you both the observer and observed?

You are not your mind

###### Are You Your Consciousness?

How would you separate consciousness from the mind?

Consciousness is an awareness of thoughts in the mind

Consciousness is one of those thoughts

Consciousness emerges from mind

Most people self-identify with consciousness, a small subset of thoughts in the mind

#### Your Consciousness is not You

##### Most People Impute a "self" onto Their Conscious Experience

###### This is an Illusion of Mind

###### Awareness is Aware of Itself

Consciousness is one of the processes of mind that consciousness is aware of

The awareness that is unique to consciousness is consistent and persistent

The awareness is aware of itself and its persistence due to memory

###### The Awareness of Awareness Creates Innate Self-identification

We typically call this self awareness

It's more accurately characterized as an awareness of awareness

No self is required

###### Self is Imputed by Memory and Persistence over time

Innate self identification

It is merely a concept in the mind

There is nothing real or substantial here

##### Most People Believe Consciousness is Intrinsic rather than Emergent

###### People Endow Their Self with Characteristics is Does not Have

Exists from it own side

Immutable

Permanent

Existing independent of the brain and mind that generates it

This is a matter of debate

What happens after death?

###### Consciousness is not the Soul

###### Consciousness is not Permanent

###### Consciousness Does not Exist outside the Mind and Brain it Emerges from

##### Innate Self-importance Follows Innate Self-identification

###### Survival Benefit

Take care of the body and brain responsible for the self

Same reasons our natural instincts make us unhappy

###### Privileged Access

The information presented to consciousness can't be shared with others

Loneliness of self

Uniqueness of self

Uniqueness creates specialness

#### Who Am I?

##### Why Do You Have to Be Anything?

###### A Strong Intuition that "I" Exist

Appears self evident

###### The Essence of Self-grasping

###### Self-grasping Leads to Self-cherishing

The root of all suffering

###### Can You Be Okay with Being Nothing?

##### What if You Are Nothing at All?

##### What if You Are Merely an Illusion Created by the Persistence of Memory and Imputation?

##### The Feeling of Uniqueness and Specialness

#### Am I My Soul?

##### What Precisely is the Soul?

###### Repository of the Self

Basis of imputation of the "I"

###### Starting point for Many Metaphysical Beliefs of the Afterlife

##### Buddhists Posit the Very Subtle Mind

###### Gross Mind Ends

###### No Memories Survive Death

###### No Personality Survives Death

###### Only Imprints of past Thoughts and Deeds Persist

The Santa Clause list

##### Hindus Posit an Eternal Soul

###### Become One with Brahman at Death

##### Christians Posit an Everlasting Self

###### Memories of Life

###### Continued Mental Processing

###### New Memories Can Be Added from Activity in the Afterlife

#### Can I Ever Find Salvation?

##### "you" Will Never Be Saved

##### Salvation is Abandoning the Self

##### Salvation is Leaving Yourself behind

#### The Mind Can Be Purified to Eliminate Suffering

##### Applying Opponents

###### Emptiness

###### Rejoicing

###### Impermanence

###### Patient Acceptance

###### Non-judgment (equanimity)

###### Compassion

##### Object Meditation or Prayer

#### How Object Meditation Works

##### Changing the Emotional Weights Assigned to Thoughts

##### How to Pray

###### Thoughts and Feelings

###### Formulate Good Thoughts

What is good?

###### Feelings Are the Response

#### How Thoughts and Emotions Work together in the Mind

##### Thoughts and Emotions Can Form Feedback Loops

###### Looping Thoughts Serve to Intensify Feelings

###### Increasing Feeling Intensity Serves to Spawn More Thoughts

###### This Can Easily Become a downward Spiral into Non-virtuous Thinking

The fire of anger and hatred

###### With Practice, it Can Become an upward Spiral into Virtuous Thinking

##### Thoughts and Emotions Drive All Behavior

###### Cultivating Virtuous States of Mind Leads to Good Behavior

###### Allowing Non-virtuous States of Mind to Take Hold Leads to Bad Behavior

##### Thoughts, Emotions, and Behavior Determine Peace of Mind

###### Training the Mind and Heart Leads to Supreme Happiness

#### The Emotional Intensity Equation

##### Certainty X Importance = Emotional Intensity

##### Emotional Intensity Determines the Focus of Consciousness

##### What is Certainty?

###### Beliefs Are a Feeling of Certainty Associated with an Idea

###### Certainty is a Subjective Evaluation of Truth and Accuracy

###### Certainty Can Be Strong or Weak

Continuum from 0% to 100%

##### What is Importance?

###### Importance is a Subjective Evaluation of the Potential Impact of a Thought

###### What Makes a Thought Important?

How does it impact me?

This must be changed

It influences every thought in your mind

How does it impact others?

Virtuous thought to replace self importance

Ripples through the mind changing everything

The journey from me to others

That is the path

##### Example of Changing Certainty

###### You Are Walking Alone at Dusk, and You Mistake a Tree for an Attacker

You are certain you are in danger

Danger makes the importance of the information very large

Certainty times danger makes for a high emotional intensity

###### You Realize You Were Mistaken

The urgency focuses conscious attention on the matter

A review of sensory input is undertaken

The mistake is discovered by consciousness

The certainty of danger declines from near 100% to near 0%

###### The Thought Fades from the Stream of Conscious Awareness

The danger averted, other thoughts with higher emotional intestines resurface

##### Example of Changing Importance

###### You Are Walking Alone at Dusk, and You Are Approached by an Attacker

You are certain you are in danger

Danger makes the importance very large

Certainty times danger makes for a high emotional intensity

###### The Attacker Wants only Your Possessions

You give the assailant what he's after

The assailant withdraws the threat

The importance declines from near 100% to near 0%

#### Influencing Emotional Intensity

##### Influencing Certainty

###### Faith

###### Non-judgment

###### Wisdom

Pride

##### Influencing Importance

###### Needs versus Wants

###### Factors that Influence Importance

Survival

Attachment

Aversion

Delusion

##### Setting Intention

#### The Path to Salvation and the Cessation of Suffering

### Path of Cessation

#### The Path from Self-importance to Selflessness

#### Training the Mind and Heart through Daily Prayer

#### Stages, Gates, and Milestones

##### Organization of Meditations

###### Stages Are Collections of Related Meditations

###### Gates and Milestones Serve as Separators between Stages

###### Steps Are Individual Meditations

###### Gaps Are the Emotional Leaps the Practitioner is Asked to Make

## Lamrim Meditation Analysis

### The Path to Enlightenment

#### The Lamrim Sequence is a Step-by-step Guide to Enlightenment

#### Meditations Stand Alone, but Work together

### My Precious Human Life

#### Idea

##### What Makes Us Human and Separate from other Beings?

##### We Were Fortunate to Be Born Human

###### Make a List of Reasons

###### Could Have Been Born a Lower Life Form

###### We Can Engage in Spiritual Practice

##### We Should not Waste Our Life

###### When Something is Precious, You want to Use it Wisely

#### Feeling

##### The Desire to Make Good Use of Your Life

#### Sequence

##### This Must Precede the Meditation on Death and the Meditation on the Dangers of Lower Rebirth

###### Valuing Our Life is a Primary Motivation

###### People Won't respect Death or Rebirth without Thankfulness for Being Human

##### This Originally Followed the Spiritual Guide Meditation

##### No Link to Previous Meditations

##### Foundational

#### Christian Presentation

### Death and Impermanence

#### Idea

##### You Could Die Today

##### At the time of Death only Spiritual Training Has Benefit

#### Feeling

##### I Must Act now to Train My Mind and Heart

#### Sequence

##### Death Follows Life

##### Death means that Everything is Impermanent

##### This Must come before Any Discussion about what Happens after Death

#### What Does This Motivate People to Do?

##### Is Turning to God Enough?

##### Is Action Required?

##### Why Should a "saved" Christian Bother with Praying?

#### Christian Presentation

### The Danger of Lower Rebirth

#### Idea

##### If I Commit Non-virtuous Actions, I May Take Animal Rebirth

##### I Need Protection from This Danger

#### Feeling

##### Virtuous Fear

##### I Must Practice Moral Discipline

#### Metaphysical

##### What Occurs after Death is the Realm of the Metaphysical

##### Any Meditation about what Comes after Death is Going to Cause Problems with Someone's Metaphysical System

###### How Do We Deal with This Problem?

Tailor the meditation to the metaphysical system of the audience

That is what we are doing overall with this work

Make it generic as possible

This is also appealing to an audience

Scientists will like this approach

Delete it entirely

Without this meditation, there is no pointer to the need for moral discipline

We need to get to the essence of the meditation and strip away the metaphysical context

Generic

General

Pure?

#### Sequence

##### Birth, Death, then Rebirth

###### The Cycle of Life

###### Birth, Death, Afterlife

For Christians, this is about heaven

###### Birth, Death, Nothingness

What comfort is there for atheists?

Not a very inspiring meditation

Perhaps this can be linked to emptiness?

Emptiness is not nothingness

Birth, death, emptiness?

##### What Comes after Death is not Essential to the Path

###### This Meditation is about Motivating Moral Behavior

This could be accomplished in other ways

##### This Closes the Loop on the Three Related Meditations: Life, Death, Rebirth

#### Christian Presentation

### Refuge Practice

#### Idea

##### You Are Saved from Lower Rebirth if You Turn to Buddha, Dharma, and Sanga

#### Feeling

##### Relief of Fear

##### I Must Revere Buddha, Practice His Teachings, and Join a Community of Practitioners

#### Common to Every Religion

##### People Turn to God in Difficult times

##### This Meditation Encourages that

##### Metaphysical Problem: where to Turn?

#### Metaphysical

##### People Go to Refuge in a Variety of Ways across Every Religion

##### How Do We Make This so that People Aren't Offended?

###### Same Problem as Described Previously

###### Tailoring to the Audience is Probably the Best Method

##### Where Does an Atheist Go for Refuge?

##### Where Does Modern Man (scientific, agnostic) Go for Refuge?

##### How Do You Explain the Concept to Someone Who Doesn't Know what Refuge Is?

#### Sequence

##### This Could Go in front of or behind the Previous Group of 3

###### Historically, It's Been after

No connection, so it doesn't need to be

###### In front of Previous 3

If the new meditation 1 is about accepting Christ, then this makes a good meditation 2

I think this could have been meditation 2 in lamrim

By waiting until after the others, the desire to go to refuge may be stronger

It separates fear of lower rebirth from actions and their effects, and those two are related.

###### This Meditation Should Be Moved

#### Christian Presentation

### Actions and Their Effects

#### Idea

##### If I Purify My Non-virtues, I Won't Take Lower Rebirth

##### By Accumulating Virtue, I Will Make Progress toward Enlightenment Life after Life

#### Feeling

##### I Must Purify My Non-virtues

##### I Must Put Great Effort into Accumulating Merit

#### Sequence

##### This Links to the Meditation on the Fear of Rebirth

###### Strong Link if You Believe in Rebirth

##### If I Move Going for Refuge, This Will Flow the Fear of Rebirth, as it Should

##### Without the Metaphysical Link, This Meditation is less Powerful

#### Metaphysical

##### Requires a Belief in Rebirth

##### Requires a Belief in Purification or Confession

##### Requires a Belief in Accumulating Merit

#### Eliminating the Metaphysical

##### We Need to Identify the Feelings and Their Purposes Independent of the Metaphysical Framework that Generated it

###### What is the Purpose of This Meditation?

It motivates action

Correct past mistakes

Engage in future good deeds

##### Attempt #1

###### Idea

Virtuous minds lead to inner peace

Non-virtuous minds lead to continued suffering

###### Feeling

I must cultivate virtuous minds and eliminate non-virtuous minds

###### Good, but Doesn't Match the Original Feeling

###### Might Be a Better Contemplation

Everything that follows is about cultivating virtuous minds and eliminating non-virtuous minds

Without this desire, people don't know what to do on the journey

Its the only one designed to provide a tool for the journey itself

Reminder of what the point is

Disguised enlightenment

###### I like This One Best

##### Attempt #2

###### Christian Perspective

###### Idea

I must confess my sins and be forgiven

I must act in accordance with god's wishes

###### Feeling

I must abandon self-importance

I must be obedient to god

###### Feels Disjointed like I’m Cramming Two Ideas together

#### Christian Presentation

### Developing Renunciation for Samsara

#### Idea

##### There is no Satisfaction in Samsara

##### Self-grasping Creates Samsara and Binds People to it

##### Self-grasping is the Root of All Your Problems

#### Feeling

##### I Must Get out of the Endless Cycle of Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death

##### I Must Abandon My Self-grasping

#### Sequence

##### This is a Major Gateway

###### Previous Meditations Were Foundational

###### This is the Gateway to the Practice of Abandoning Self Importance

###### Just as Accepting Christ is the Gateway to Christianity

##### Requires All Foundational Meditations to Reach This Gateway

###### Prepared for the Journey ahead

###### Must Precede the Compassion Teachings

###### Puts People on the Path

###### Keeps People on the Path

##### The Joyful Path of Good Fortune Actually Breaks This down into Four Meditations

###### Each Meditation is on One of the Noble Truths

###### Since This is such an Important Gateway, Perhaps More than One Meditation is in Order?

#### Metaphysical

##### Presentation here Has Metaphysical Problems

##### Does not Require Metaphysics to Accept Truth of Idea

##### Can Be Presented Based Purely on Biology

###### The Biological Basis Needs to Be part of the Basic Description

##### Converting to Christianity Will Require Some Work

###### We Already Had the Major Gateway of Accepting Christ

###### What is the Symbolism of This Gateway?

After accepting Christ, what motivates people to do anything?

How does someone become Christ’s servant?

###### The Feeling is One of a Need to Escape

Helpless futility

Not love or devotion

###### Why Should Any Christian want to Abandon Their Self Importance?

#### Christian Presentation

### Developing Equanimity

#### Idea

##### Our Natural Reactions to People is Wrong

###### We want People We Find Attractive

###### We Don't want People We Find Repulsive

###### We Don't Notice People We Don't Find Attractive or Repulsive

##### The Appearances of Beauty, Ugliness, or Indifference Are Mistaken

##### These Mistaken Perceptions Cloud My Mind and Disturb My Peace

#### Feeling

##### I Must Stop These Mistaken Perceptions

##### I Must Develop a Warm and Friendly Attitude toward All Beings

#### Sequence

##### This is the First step on the Path

###### You Must Be Able to See People as Equal to Develop Universal Compassion

###### Every other Realization is Based on Equanimity

###### Equanimity is One of the Four Divine Abodes

#### Metaphysics

##### There is no Metaphysical Issues

##### Requires Background Understanding of the Three Reactions to Experience

###### Pleasant = Grasping or Attachment

###### Unpleasant = Hatred or Aversion

###### Neutral = Ignorance or Delusion

#### Christian Presentation

### Recognizing that All Living Beings Are Our Mothers

#### Idea

##### Since We Have Been Reborn Countless Times, Everyone Has Been Our Mother in a Previous Life

##### We Should Love All People as We Love Our Mother

#### Feeling

##### I Feel Deep Love and respect for My Mother

##### I Feel the Same Love for Everyone as I Feel for My Mother

#### Metaphysical

##### You Must Believe in Reincarnation

##### You Must Believe in Beginningless time

##### This One Can't Be Easily Translated out of Buddhism and Its World view

##### This is One of the Most Metaphysically Rooted Mediations.

###### Difficult to Understand without a Previous Belief in Reincarnation.

###### In the Buddha's Culture, Everyone Believed in Reincarnation, so This Was Commonly Accepted Belief.

###### In the 21st Century, Particularly in the West, Few Believe in Reincarnation, so This Mediation Repels Many People

Some recoil because they reject the idea itself as impossible

Some reject reincarnation because it's contrary to their pre-existing belief system

Rather than build on a concept everyone accepts as the buddha did, in today's world, this idea is a barrier to entering the path.

###### I Don't Believe the Metaphysics is Necessary to Generate the Feeling.

#### Sequence

##### The Real Purpose of This Meditation is to Intensify the Previous Mediation

###### This Meditation is Optional

We should include some meditation to increase the effect of equanimity if we can

###### Making Others Equal Doesn't Elevate Them.

###### Imagining Others as Someone Dear Elevates Everyone

##### I Don't Believe the Metaphysics is Necessary to Generate the Feeling.

###### Different Ideas from Different Metaphysical Systems Can Generate the Same Feeling.

##### This Will Be One of the Most Challenging to Translate out of Buddhism and into Christianity

###### Christianity is Loaded with Emotional Symbolism with Dear People, Most Notably Christ Himself

This mediation could be seeing Christ in all people.

Foundation of mother Theresa’s ministry in Calcutta

#### Christian Presentation

### Remembering the Kindness of Living Beings

#### Idea

##### Everything in Your Life is provided to You out of the Kind Actions of Others

###### The Motivations of Others Does not Matter

If you benefit from another's actions, you are enjoying their kindness

Just because you paid for something doesn't mean the person providing that good or service isn't being kind to you

###### Acknowledging Kindness Improves Your Disposition toward Others

#### Feeling

##### Affectionate Love for All Living Beings

##### A Deep Gratitude for the Kind Efforts of All Living Beings

#### Metaphysics

##### There Are no Metaphysical Issues

##### Kindness is Universal

#### Sequence

##### Lamrim Has Two Meditations in between to Elevate Others

###### Recognizing that All Living Beings Are Our Mothers

###### Remembering the Kindness of Living Beings

###### Both Meditations Function as Enhancers

Needed to bridge a large emotional gap

Optional to the degree people can cross the gap

##### The First Begins with Family, Which is Generally the Strongest Bond

##### The Second Extends that to Everyone Else

##### It is a Good Sequence

#### Christian Presentation

### Equalizing Self and Others

#### Idea

##### We Must come to view All People as Equally Important

###### All Living Beings Have Shown Me Great Kindness

###### All Beings want to Be Free from Suffering.

We are all equal

###### I Am only One while Countless Others Are also Suffering.

How can I care about myself alone and neglect others?

###### I Am no More Important than Any other Being

#### Feeling

##### I Cherish All Living Beings Equally

###### I Put Nobody out of My Heart

###### Others Are as Important as I Am

#### Metaphysics

##### There Are no Metaphysical Issues

#### Sequence

##### This Meditation Naturally Follows the Meditation on Equanimity

##### Lamrim Practitioners May Have Discovered that the Leap from Equanimity to Equalizing Self and Others Was Too Big of a Leap

###### It's One Thing to Believe All Others Are Equal. It's Another to Believe They Are All Equal with Me

###### The Leap from Equalizing Self with Others to Exchanging Self with Others is a Big Leap, so there Are Two "refresher" Meditations in between

##### The End of a Sequence that Began with Equanimity

##### Start of a Sequence that Leads to Exchanging Self with Others

###### First We Must Equalize, then Elevate to Our Level, then We exchange

###### Despite the Two Intervening Meditations, the Leap from Equalizing to Exchanging is Huge

I personally find this leap the most difficult

#### Christian Presentation
