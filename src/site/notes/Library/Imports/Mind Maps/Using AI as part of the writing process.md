# Using AI as part of the Writing Process

# Writing as Problem Solving

# Phases of Writing Process

## Gestation

### Away from Computer, Notes, Often Engaged in other Activities

### Time Spent Driving in My Car, Working in My Yard, Cleaning My House

### Freeform Conscious Processing

#### All the Mind to Jump to Related Topics

#### Explore the Topic Thoroughly

#### No Concern for Order, Importance, Organization, no Filtering of Any Kind

### Much Subconscious Processing

#### Moments of Consciousness Blanking while the Intuitive Mind Works Its Magic, Thinking without Thought

##### Pondering Feeling

##### Observable Phenomenon

#### Intention is Set to Process the Information and Integrate Meanings

#### Subconscious Mind Acts like a Support Team Working in a Black Box.

##### You Don't Know Consciously what the Team is Doing

##### You Don't Know Consciously how They Go about Their Tasks

##### You Must Exercise Patience and Wait for the Answers to Emerge from the Black Box

##### You Gain Faith in the Answers from This Intuitive Process through Later Examination and Verification of Truth and Conformance to the Real World

##### Thus Intuition and Logical Analysis Work together Harmoniously Each Supporting the other

###### Intuition Gains Valuable Data Filtering Ensuring We Don't Put Garbage in and Get Garbage out

###### Analysis Gains Valuable Processing time and Energy. Intuition Can Accomplish in Hours what a Conscious Mind May Need Weeks to Sort through

###### Intuition and Logical Analysis Complement Each Other, Combining Speed and Depth for Efficient Decision-making. Intuition Filters Large Amounts of Information, Identifying Patterns and Connections that Logical Reasoning May Miss, while Analysis Refines These Insights into Structured Conclusions. This Synergy Accelerates Problem-solving, Offering Thoughtful Solutions Faster than Logic Alone. Fields like Science and Art Often Rely on Intuitive Leaps, Validated by Rigorous Analysis, to Achieve Breakthroughs. Neuroscience Supports This Collaboration, Showing that Intuition's Unconscious Processing Enhances the Efficiency of Logical Thinking.
