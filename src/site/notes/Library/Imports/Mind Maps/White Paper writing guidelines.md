# White Paper Writing Guidelines

# This Guideline Provides Conceptual Guidance and Specific Guidance for Turning the Structured Outline into a Finished Prodcut

# Drafts and Goals for Each

## - First Draft: Focus on Technical Accuracy and Completeness

## - Second Draft: Enhance Narrative Flow and Accessibility

## - Third Draft: Refine Metaphors and Examples

## - Final Draft: Harmonize Technical and Accessible Elements

# Broader Themes

## Review Previous Candidates for Names and See if They Can Help Inform the Broader Themes of the Entire Work

## - Identify and Develop 2-3 Core Narratives that Weave throughout the Document

## - Use Recurring Metaphors and Examples that Evolve alongside Technical Complexity

## - Create "callback" Moments that Reinforce Earlier Concepts in New Contexts

## Identify 2-3 "hero journeys" that Exemplify Transformation

### Map Key Milestones to Technical Concepts

### Create Parallel Tracks For:

### Individual Empowerment

### Collective Advancement

### Technical Evolution

## Start the Process by Feeding the Entire Outline into the AI and Request to Identify Candidates for Each of the Above. These Will Be Incorporated into the Final Set of Instructions

#### "What Recurring Visual Motifs (e.g., Networks, Bridges, pathways) Can Help Anchor Complex Ideas across sections?"

#### "How Can Diagrams Evolve to Reflect Increasingly Complex Interactions between AI Agents and Human users?"

### Interactive Engagement:

#### "What Visuals or Sidebars Might Invite the Reader to Imagine Their Role in Using This framework?"

## Visual Narrative Strategy

### - Begin Each Major Section with an Overview Diagram

### - Use Progressive Disclosure in Visual Complexity

### - Maintain Consistent Visual Language throughout

### - Create Visual Echoes between Related Concepts

# Basic Unit of the Outline

## Topic

### Subtopic

### Subtopic

### Subtopic

## Nearly Always Arranged with a Topic and Three Subtopics.

## The Topics and Subtopics Have Enough Information to provide Concise and Clear Narratives that Fully Explore the Topic.

# Organization of the Generated Text Items

## Topic is Heading

## Introduction to Topic

### Transition from Previous Topic

### Concise Description of the Topic and the Three Subtopics

## Bullet point List of Subtopics

### Better than Additional Headings

#### Paragraphs Would Be Too Small

#### Couldn't Talk about All Three Subtopics together

#### Provides a Quick Visual Summary for Those Who Skim

## Image or Diagram Illustrating the Topic in Some Meaningful way

## Text Explaining Image and Three Subtopics

### Generally Three Paragraphs

### Can Be part of the Larger Meta Topic Narrative if Appropriate

### There is a Reason These Were Grouped together

## Relating Statement

### Goal is to Find Something that Relates the Abstract Concepts to the Real World.

#### Can Be an Apt Analogy or Metaphor

#### Could Be Odd but Memorable Example

#### - Start with Universal Human Experiences (e.g., Learning, Creating, connecting)

#### - Bridge to Technical Concepts through Familiar Processes

#### - Test Analogies against Multiple Audience Perspectives

#### - Build a Hierarchy of Metaphors from Simple to Complex

### Simple Statement, Often as if Explained to a Pre-teen or even an 8 Year Old.

### This Will Take Creativity and Imagination, but It's Essential to Relate Each Topic Each Section to Something Readers and Easily Relate to and Relate to Broader Themes

## Closing Summary of Topic

### Recap only if Needed

### Why is This Topic Essential to the Overall Project

### Why Wouldn't the Project Work without It?

### What Was the Limitation like before This Innovation?

### Transition to next Topic

## Closing aside

### This is not part of the Narrative

### Citations

### References

### Mention Any Appendices Devoted to the Topic

#### Create One for Each Topic as Appropriate

# Writing Process

## Images and Text Are Generated per the Checklist above

## Start at the Lowest Level of the Outline

### The Process Will Build up from the Ground up

### Generates Information for Higher Level Summaries

## Iterative Improvement

### Provide the Same Instructions to Two or Three Different AIs

#### Chat GPT

#### Gemini

#### Claude, if Internet search Isn't Needed

### Feed the Results of the other Two into the Third and Ask for a Revision considering the other Versions.

### Pick Intuitively if the Content Stands out

### Feed All Three Updated Versions into the AIs and Ask for Opinion of the Best One

### If not Impressed with the Product, Try Again

## Consider Narrative Continuity

### - Begin Each Major Section by Explicitly Connecting to Previous Themes

### - Identify and Develop 2-3 Core Narratives that Weave throughout the Document

### - Use Recurring Metaphors and Examples that Evolve alongside Technical Complexity

### - Create "callback" Moments that Reinforce Earlier Concepts in New Contexts
