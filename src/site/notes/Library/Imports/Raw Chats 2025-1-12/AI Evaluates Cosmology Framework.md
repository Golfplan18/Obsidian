Here is the work and the associated image. I need a good working title. 10 options.

"
Take the AI Challenge
I'm writing to share a cosmological framework that reexamines Hubble's Law through the lens of boundary gravitational effectsâ€”much as Einstein's thought experiments revealed hidden premises in classical mechanics. This analysis suggests that cumulative gravitational lensing at the observable universe's edge might naturally explain phenomena currently attributed to cosmic expansion, like starlight bending around a massive object reveals unseen gravitational influences.
To facilitate efficient evaluation of these ideas, I've structured an assessment process using modern analytical tools that can serve as an initial scientific sounding board:
1. Download the PDF manuscript from its Internet Archive location [The Expanding Awareness Cosmology]
2. Visit either anthropic.com (Claude) or gemini.google.com (Gemini)
3. Upload the downloaded PDF to your chosen AI platform
4. Provide this analysis prompt:
Please evaluate this cosmological framework for:
* Technical rigor and logical architecture
* Integration with established physics principles
* Novel contributions and empirically testable predictions
* Scientific merit warranting deeper investigation
Like having a skilled research assistant perform an initial review, these analytical tools can rapidly illuminate the framework's potential significanceâ€”offering a clear signal about whether deeper investigation might yield valuable insights.
The complete online version with helpful videos is available at The Expanding Awareness Cosmology: A New Vision of the Universe, also broken it down into five parts starting here: Part 1: Historical Perspective, and for a more casual exploration of these concepts: Breaking Hubble's Law.
I look forward to your AI-assisted evaluation and, should the analysis spark interest, to engaging in deeper dialogue about these ideas that may reshape our understanding of the cosmos.
