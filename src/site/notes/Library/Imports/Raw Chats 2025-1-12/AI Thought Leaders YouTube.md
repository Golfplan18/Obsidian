<i>[12/1/2024, 4:03:19 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: I want to organize my existing pen names and perhaps generate others to suit topics I want to discuss. These pen names are basically characters I create and speak through. For some of them, I have developed detailed past histories. I want each one to have a specific voice that represents their sex, their beliefs, and the attitudes I bring to them. I want to be able to bring up this character, interact with them, and speak through them when I desire. I think a GPT may be a way to do this. I'm also considering using novelcrafter and create these pen names as an author profile or character profile, or something like that. Provide me a list of AI tools and applications and specific techniques other writers have used for this.<br>
