write a google search engine meta description for the following: I am Anatta.

Not my real name, of course; Anatta is the Buddhist idea that no substantial self actually exists.

I chose that name because I don’t want attention.

It’s not about me.

It’s about the writing and the message.

What Makes Me Different?

I spent many hours in float tanks practicing Lamrim in total sensory deprivation.

This is not an ordinary life experience.

https://youtu.be/qV8A49GvqMw

It’s shaped every aspect of who I am.

I hope that piques your curiosity.

My Spiritual Awakening

I dabbled in Buddhist practice for about 20 years.

However, when I started practicing Lamrim in the float tank, my practice blossomed.

I might never have gained realizations beyond the intellectual without this preparation.

Even after hundreds of hours in deep meditation, I still struggled with worldly concerns.

That all changed for me in a rather dramatic fashion.

What I Felt When I Won the Lottery

Please Respect my Anonymity

I am a ghost.

Invisible.

A voice of Light with no material substance. No ego to grasp onto.

The spotlight should never be on me.

My Muse is Polyhymnia, Goddess of Hymns and Sacred Poetry. Channeling Polyhymnia’s voice is a tremendous writing experience.

I cherish it.

I honor it.

Desiring fame, her voice would fall silent. I don’t want that.

That’s the Spiritual Teacher’s Paradox. If you Want it, you can’t have it.

It’s the downfall of every Spiritual fraud.

If my identity were to become widely known, my Muse would flutter away, chased by my Desire for fame.

I don’t want that.

If you like my writing, neither should you.

It’s not impossible to figure out who I am. But if you do, please keep it to yourself because I will never acknowledge it.

Even if it means I must lie to misdirect you.

Don’t make me a liar.

Please respect my anonymity.

I am not establishing a brand, acquiring fame, or planting ideas about who I am in your mind.

I don’t wish to impress anyone, signal virtue, seek accolades, or aggrandize myself in any way.

Anonymity allows me to tell my story from my heart and express my perspective even when unpopular.

Particularly when unpopular and the dogs of Political Correctness want to pounce on me and eat my flesh.

Ordinary Sacred Text

Have you noticed that writers of religious material try to sound all peaceful and religious, inflated with air, floating, rising above it all.

It’s a fraud.

Arrogant Pride. Nothing more.

If you channel real Power, it enables every part of you, including a devilish sense of humor; at least, that’s what happened to me.

I suppress no part of me.

If I feel Light, you will too. If I feel Dark, you will too.

And I will take you to very bright Light and really, really Dark places in your Mind.

I’m not hiding any part of me out of fear of your reaction.

Judge me. Hate on me. Love Me.

I will drink it all in and give you Love in return.

My Heart is alchemy in motion.

My Son and My Family Are My World

I am the father of a young man with autism.

As he grew up physically, I grew up emotionally.

He is the focus of my spiritual practice.

Without him, I would have remained a self-involved, narcissistic egomaniac obsessed with worldly pursuits.

I love him.

I owe him everything. He inspires me.

My journey to accepting my son’s condition revealed my purpose for being.

The quest for complete acceptance is transformative, and it’s not what many special needs parents think it is.

I haven’t come to terms with something terrible or learned to endure some great hardship.

Quite the contrary, I recognize that I am uniquely blessed with a lifelong relationship full of special joys few others will ever experience.

In fact, the only others who will ever really know the joys of my life are other special needs parents — at least those who’ve come to appreciate the gift.

That is the core message I want to share with other parents who find themselves with the unexpected treasure of a special needs child.

Your child is perfect as-is.

My compassion for special needs children provides the drive and energy for my writing.

My love for my son is deep and abiding, and I extend my feelings for my own son to others like him.

My compassion for my son is mixed with attachment, but my compassion for other special needs children is pure.

I’ve spent many hours contemplating the problematic lives of special needs children.

True stories of horrific sufferings inflicted upon special needs children are sadly familiar.

Special needs persons, often completely helpless, rarely get what they want, and some can’t even communicate their needs, which often go unmet.

They are sometimes rejected by family, abused, neglected, shut away, and hidden in shame.

They often live lonely lives shunned by others bathing in toxic shame.

Many lack social skills, but they have no lack of desire for social contact. They want friends, lovers, and family like everyone else, but they have more difficulties fulfilling their desires.

These are unpleasant truths to think about, and it’s easier to turn away.

Compassion arises strongly when I contemplate these truths, particularly for helpless children.

Out of that compassion, a strong desire emerges to lessen the suffering of special needs children.

That’s why I write.

Please see my finest work: The Unbridled Joy of Special Needs Parenting

Contact Me, but only from your Heart

If you want to reach me, I am at

selflessanatta@gmail.com

I will only respond to requests from the Heart.

If you seek money, fame, or worldly concerns, I won’t hear you because I can’t help you in those areas.

Please don’t waste my time with such requests.

write a meta description for the following: What is meditation?

Many people think merely observing their mind is meditation.

It’s certainly a start, and you could call it meditation, but observing chaos does nothing to quiet the mind or reign in the turmoil.

Many people then engage in breath meditation, focusing attention on the breath and the sensations around the breathing process.

That is also useful, just as a track athlete would stretch and warm up.

Breath meditation is an excellent way to prepare your mind.

However, if that’s all you do, you don’t actually go anywhere. Like a sprinter who warms up but doesn’t enter the race.

My observation is that most meditation programs don’t go far beyond breath meditations.

Theravāda Buddhism has meditations such as Loving-Kindness, or Maitrī. The meditator is asked to think about certain things and feel the feelings that arise.

This is object meditation.

Vajrayāna Buddhism is prevalent in Tibet, and it’s the form of meditation I practice.

They take object meditation to the extreme.

They call it object meditation, but you don’t focus your attention on things. The “object” of meditation is a virtue or, more specifically, the feelings that arise when you think about virtue.

In the meditations, you start with contemplation, thinking about something, and when the virtuous feeling arises, you hold onto that feeling for as long as you can, hours if you have the concentration for it.

If you lose the feeling, you return to the contemplation, generate the feeling again, and then hold it.

You become well-practiced at generating and holding virtuous feelings in your heart.

What is Virtue?

Western philosophers elaborate on what constitutes virtue and how we should live.

The Vajrayāna Buddhists have a much simpler outlook.

A virtuous object is one that causes us to develop a peaceful mind when we concentrate on it.

If we concentrate on an object that disturbs our mind, like anger, jealousy, or attachment, then the object is non-virtuous.

The entire point of meditation in the Vajrayāna tradition is to attain peace of mind.

It works!

When my mind is peaceful, I feel happy.

It isn’t complicated.

It doesn’t need to be.

Because happiness is so elusive to most people (See The First Noble Truth), most people assume the answer must be complex, difficult to understand, and nearly impossible to implement.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Aristotle understood this out 2,500 years ago, but he didn’t have the Buddha’s insights on how to achieve it. All these years later, and Western Philosophy still hasn’t figured it out.

https://youtu.be/k-J9BVBjK3o

Flooding my heart with Virtue

It isn’t something I can prove scientifically, but I’ve found that holding these feelings for extended periods reorients your thinking by changing your heart.

If you spend hours meditating on how much you love the world, the selfish Desire to lie, cheat, steal, and kill simply doesn’t arise.

The power of object meditation manifests in the way it shapes your heart.

Once my heart was trained to virtue, I didn’t think much about rules and procedures to guide my behavior.

I naturally walked the eightfold path.

Right understanding (Samma ditthi)

Right thought (Samma sankappa)

Right speech (Samma vaca)

Right action (Samma kammanta)

Right livelihood (Samma ajiva)

Right effort (Samma vayama)

Right mindfulness (Samma sati)

Right concentration (Samma samadhi)

This didn’t happen because I studied it and attempted to apply it like I was following a rule book.

It merely happened because my heart was so well-trained in virtue that I was motivated to do it naturally.

BUDDHISM & SPIRITUAL PRACTICEHow to Understand Karma and Apply It to Your Life

Karma; Whenever something happens I didn’t want or foresee, I still feel an initial burst of anger. How dare Fate, Karma, God, (insert anyone other than me) make this awful thing happen? Am I a victim? After giggling at my foolishness momentarily, a nanosecond later, I cut it off by reminding myself that whatever occurs, it happens because of actions I took in the past, even if it was lifetimes ago.

Read full story

In fact, I speculate that the eightfold path is not actually a set of instructions but rather a set of evaluative criteria that Buddhist masters can use to tell if a practitioner has indeed achieved higher-level realizations.

Without object meditation, none of this would be possible.

Where to find Virtuous Objects

The New Meditation Handbook from Tharpa Publications, production of the New Kadampa Tradition:

The New Meditation Handbook is a practical guide to meditation that teaches us how to make ourself and others happy by developing inner peace, and in this way making our lives more meaningful. Without inner peace there is no real happiness at all. Problems, suffering and unhappiness do not exist outside the mind; they are feelings and thus part of our mind. Therefore, it is only by controlling our mind that we can permanently stop our problems and make ourself and others truly happy. The twenty-one Buddhist meditation practices presented in this book are actual methods to control our mind and experience lasting inner peace. This extremely practical guide is an indispensable handbook for those seeking happiness and meaning in their lives.

This one book, more than any other, is responsible for changing my life.

I also suggest the three-volume set The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, an extended study on Lamrim.<br>

Prior to the flowering of consciousness, God could not do this, making Him, less than all-Powerful, less than all-Knowing, less than Whole, incomplete.

God created separate conscious beings — you and me — so that He can Live through us, and incorporate those things into Himself, making Him fully Omniscient by adding the human experience to Himself.

meta description: "There is a Season

When answers to my questions include a wonderfully uplifting feeling of smoke blown up my ass, I quickly deduce that I need to ask better questions.

I recently had an intense emotional awakening.

When the empowerment came, I asked myself: “Why did this happen now and not some other time?”

I got decent answers.

Funny ones, anyway.

Trigger Warning

What follows will appeal to men more than women, except for those rare few who can laugh at extreme male stupidity on full display.

It’s crass.

It’s totally male.

It’s totally heterosexually male in raw detail.

The Court Jester really wanted to show this picture, so here it is.

The Court Jester secretly hopes everyone on earth discovers through this viral post and admires Him with flattering, racy comments.

He is self-important, proud, and vain.

He also complains that Humility is overrated.

I let him show his ignorant ass, just for the giggles.

He is my court jester.

You can get away with crap like that when you write anonymously!

Realistically, if I had become empowered as a younger man, I wouldn’t have survived the hedonistic binge that would have followed.

Pardon my digression, but my court jester did entertain me with some fantastic ideas that I would have implemented as an over-empowered, testosterone-pumped young man.

I’m confident that I would have employed a harem of stunning nude call girls to inhabit my pool.

Yeah, realistically, if I really didn’t have any reason to stop myself.

I would have.

Perhaps I have them catcall to me, call me “Big Boy,” and say, “You’re the man.”

That would be fun.

The La Quinta Cove Cock demonstrates that the desire for a big cock manifests in unusual ways.

G.O.A.T.

I might even take it one step further.

Why not?

I have the money. I only live once.

I would GO for it, in a big way.

Think of the Qi flow.

Wow!

My private harem of stunning nudes (their objects, not people) would have been extremely well paid to convince me — using all feminine charms at her disposal — the following Immutable Truths:

My monstrous member goes waaaay deep and feels ecstatically overwhelming, stimulating orgasms on contact. My Wand is magic!

As a lover, I am GOAT, the greatest of all time; not just her time, not just her best, I am the best lover that any woman ever had the privilege to pleasure. (That last part mandates deep digging for a strong performance. Method actors preferred.)

She eagerly enjoys my pleasures, no matter how bizarre; if she really doesn’t like it, she must fake it perfectly every time, forever, or until I tire of her and desire a replacement. A melon softens with too many squeezes.

She gushes excitedly for her good fortune and the honor of pleasing me. She is entirely selflessly devoted to my selfish pleasure — a true religious devotee willing to worship my manhood.

I would have expected Academy Award performances, and internally, I would have fostered the illusion and lived in that warped reality.

That really shouldn’t be surprising to anyone.

If any heterosexual male denies the above, I call bullshit.

Women, men, swap parts. Imagine the characters as you please. If the image appeals, the lover is believable, and they react to you by those four principles, you would like that.

It would be something you want.

There is a reason Leonardo DiCaprio has a cult of devotees who habitually spit-polish his knob.

He likes it.

Leo, My Court Jester thinks you RULE! He wants to throw a party and invite my favorite rock bands from the 80s. It will be GLORIOUS!!!

https://youtu.be/FMbl1ntpIXQ

Leo, Seriously, my apologies for any offense. The performances you and Johnny Depp delivered in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. That’s G.O.A.T. I didn’t see you. I only saw Arnie. Remarkable. That movie deeply touched my heart.

Johnny, My wife was tempted to stuff you into the trunk of her car when you consulted a map for directions in a parking lot in Las Vegas 30 years ago. She still tells the story. She’s says your hot.

Living an illusion is very tempting. With enough money, you can afford an entourage of hangers-on, like Elvis did.

You can create the illusion of who you want to be, arrange your environment to reinforce your delusions, surround yourself with “yes” men (and women, of course), and live the dream.

The key takeaway I get from the above video is how they identified a specific brainwave pattern, the gamma wave, that only shows up in very experienced meditators.

Buddhist meditators call this “Beginners Mind,” or Shoshin, which is ironic because no beginner experiences it.

Scientists freely admit they have no idea what this is.

What Daniel Goleman concludes is that advanced meditators do live in a different mind reality than most people.

Only then, I fully appreciated the joy you brought to my life.

I’m sorry for the wasted years when I rejected even a small part of you.

I was a fool.

Every day, you allowed me to serve as the agent of your will in the world.

In serving you wisely, I hope, I found the boundless joy of giving, unfettered by fear of exploitation, a pure joy, deeply satisfying.

When you grew into a man, you became my best friend and constant companion.

You are fun and funny, entertaining me with your smile.

You are loyal, devoted, and loving, and I always felt you sincerely appreciated the time and love I poured into you.

You became a buoyant, playful, deliriously happy man.

Your character expresses itself through giving, acceptance, affection, and your burning desire to help others.

You embody all that I fell short of. I admire you, and I deeply respect the man you became.

I gave you all the years of love and support that I could.

In devoting myself to you, Life revealed a hidden path to Love that few are privileged to travel — a path only open to me because of you.

I am blessed to have a son like you. I’m thankful you were so patient while I found my way to you.

The time is coming soon when I will not be there to care for you, hug you, or love you. I know you will miss my companionship.

Whatever remains of me will long to be with you again.

Do not fear the changes in your life after I’m gone.

I lived with that fear and prepared for this change so that you will be well cared for.

The world is full of good people, and I arranged affairs to ensure your remaining time is full of caregivers who will be kind and loving, putting your needs and wants first.

And my deepest hope was that someone will love you enough to hug you like I did.

Everyone deserves the affection of a simple, loving hug.

As my last bequest, I give you the only thing of value I have left to offer.

During my life, if I gave more than I took, if I accumulated any wealth of merit or goodwill, if my life produced anything of intangible value at all, I tender all my emotional wealth to you and the caregivers who will provide for you after I’m gone.

By surrendering all my merit and goodness to you at my death, only my foibles will go with me.

Without goodness, I may be judged harshly by God, or I may reincarnate as a honey bee to learn the joy of service to others all over again.

It would suck comprehensively, in every way, swallowing my Qi in the process. (It wouldn’t be that bad, but I certainly don’t want to lose it.)

meta description "The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the US Government, likely backed by the entire scientific community, declares:

Schizophrenia usually involves delusions (false beliefs), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that don’t exist), unusual physical behavior, and disorganized thinking and speech. It is common for people with schizophrenia to have paranoid thoughts or hear voices.

The first two statements, the ones with parenthesis for clarification, are wrong.

Completely and totally wrong.

Illustrative of a more significant mindset that is even more wrong. As if they can define what exists and does not exist, the height of hubris and arrogance.

Allow me to explain.

Who am I, and why should you listen to me?

Several years ago, I arranged my life to spend several hundred hours in float tanks practicing Lamrim in total sensory deprivation.

I put in the time.

I learned how to observe my mind.

I have actual insights into how the mind works, not some academic interpretation based on books and a destructive material reductionist mindset that says the only reality is the one we can see and touch.

I have data.

And not just data from meditation.

I’ve spent time in a mental health facility. It was illuminating and unpleasant.

See: Unsafe and Unclean: Pacific Grove Hospital in Riverside, California

So here is how your mind works.

The mind contains an Ultimate Divide that separates objective reality from subjective experience.

This split creates two realities: Body and Mind.

Body Reality and Mind Reality

Body reality is the objective reality within which we must interact. It’s the reality of material reductionism, the mechanics of how things work.

Eliminative Materialism is the ultimate wrong answer. Completely 100% wrong. The opposite of Truth. No wiggle room here.

The Mind reality a subjective reality within which we have unlimited control to create reality as we wish.

Fundamental Truth of the Mind

Every belief in your head begins as a seed planted in Body Reality.

Some information in the outside world enters your awareness.

Philosophers call these Brute Facts or, more simply, Data.

From there, you have complete control to interpret the meaning of that fact.

This is the key insight from Victor Frankl’s Man Search for Meaning.

Interpretations are up to you.

People don’t realize that they have this power, which is why so few are enlightened, but everyone has this power.

Anyone can develop this power.

Since you read my words, you understand it now, at least on an intellectual level, the level of data and facts.

But there is a deeper level, the level of heart and mind. It doesn’t know that yet.

In order for me to cross that divide in myself, I had to spend countless hours in float tanks practicing Lamrim in total sensory deprivation.

I wish I knew an easier way to get there.

It’s a lot of work, much of it very emotionally difficult.

But if you follow that path, you’d get there, too.

Experience the Reality of a Schizophrenic for Yourself

I can drive this point home to you with an experience you can obtain anywhere you see a VR headset being sold, often at Microsoft brick-and-mortar stores or wherever the Oculus is sold.

https://youtu.be/qnVQFSUIDjE

If you try Richie’s Plank Experience, you will quickly discover that your Mind Reality can completely disconnect from your Body Reality.

In the Plank experience, your Body Reality is that you are standing in a completely safe environment with no physical danger at all.

However, your Mind Reality is that you are standing on a plank many stories up, and the slightest misstep will result in your untimely death.

The VR experience makes this disconnection so complete that you will have the emotional experience of actually being there.

Let the profundity of that sink in. We will return to it momentarily.

The Mind of a Schizophrenic

Schizophrenics fully understand the nature of the Human Mind.

Far more so than the reductive materialists around them telling them they are crazy.

This is why Schizophrenics often have strong religious experiences and are utterly impervious to reasoning thrown at them by the “experts” around them.

They are right.

Everyone else is wrong.

Not just in their Minds but in Truth, in the objective world.

It takes a lot of gaslighting to convince someone their Mind Reality is not real, particularly when you’re talking with a Schizophrenic.

In their mind, they are an adult who knows, and the person gaslighting is a toddler who does not.

The Schizophrenic is right about that.

Schizophrenics are never going to respond well to cognitive therapies designed to convince them their Mind Reality is not real.

It shouldn’t be surprising that the entire medical community turns to drugs for the answer.

Drugs are an Essential Safety Net

No, I’m not going to say we should stop using drugs with Schizophrenics. That would result in a large number of completely unnecessary deaths.

Remember back to Richie’s Plank Experience? A Schizophrenic has the opposite juxtaposition of safety and danger.

A Schizophrenic could, in Body Reality, be standing on a plank where the slightest misstep results in death, but in Mind Reality, they may be roaming the Scottish Moors, free and untroubled.

The clash of these two realities becomes apparent when they take their first step.

So, if Schizophrenics lose their connection, they can expose themselves to great danger, necessitating a safety net to prevent untimely death.

I would not practice on a Trapeze without a safety net. Would you?

I don’t want Schizophrenics to die. And neither do you.

Drugs are a necessary safety net when Schizophrenics lose the bridge to Body Reality.

It’s absolutely critical that you find the right drug to do this if you want to make sure Schizophrenics don’t make the ultimate mistake.

I know many people are resistant to even exploring drug options. I highly suggest you drop that resistance.

Why Drugged Schizophrenics are Unhappy

When you drug a Schizophrenic, you make them very unhappy. We give them the necessary drugs to keep them alive, but offering cognitive therapies does little to make them feel good about it.

Allow me to share a personal experience that illustrates this.

See: What I Felt When I Won the Lottery

My life circumstances came together in an intense emotional experience where the rate at which my brain processes information temporarily doubled and even since operates at a level much, much faster than before this experience.

The experience arrived with little notice, so I could not properly prepare my family for what they might see.

It was traumatic. They took me to the hospital for testing, rightly so.

When the physicians examined me, they couldn’t find anything wrong other than my heart-rate had jumped from 50–60 beats per minute up to about 100 beats per minute.

I felt great, highly amped up, but it was not the slightest bit painful.

Out of their concern, they asked me to take some medications. They handed me a cocktail of Xanax and Valium, two powerful neurotransmitter suppressors.

I joked with them that I didn’t want to take that poison because it would take a lot of effort to purge it, perhaps several hours. I didn’t obtain complete poison immunity in the power-up as I hadn’t mastered all the needed visualizations.

The nurse told me to relax, and that I would feel better in the morning, so I decided to take the pills.

Within minutes, I could feel the fog of these drugs dragging on my mind. It did nothing to drop my heart rate, which I watched carefully.

I called in the Marines in my mind and started imagining each one grabbing an enemy and then parachuting down to my kidney for filtering and removal.

It’s a great visualization, but there are better ones I don’t know.

Grigori Rasputin knew more visualizations. He had near poison immunity.

I wish I had his knowledge. His death was a loss because I don’t believe he passed it down to anyone.

About an hour in, I struggled to maintain the discipline as I approached losing consciousness.

After another hour, I began regaining more clarity, and I called up the Marines with renewed enthusiasm to complete their mission.

By the end of three hours, I stepped out to the nurse’s station to tweak her. I looked her straight in the eye, held her gaze, and said. “Three hours.” And I went back to my room.

I remember clearly the emotional side of that experience in the last hour.

An awful feeling arose.

A concern that the gift I received, the payoff for 35 years of meditation and countless hours in float tanks practicing Lamrim in total sensory deprivation, everything I had worked for had been taken from me by modern medicine.

I didn’t start at birth, so I’m ancient, not 35 years old.

I mentioned that time and Effort are required to obtain these realizations.

I felt the pain of all Schizophrenics who get pulled back from their beautiful state of Mind Reality and are forced to live in a crappy, reductionist world.

I don’t have to live there because I am not Schizophrenic (despite the cries from material reductionists who, out of willful ignorance, fail to see that).

Unfortunately, those who are Schizophrenic must live there until they learn to use their Mind Reality to bridge back to Body Reality.

This Doesn’t Apply to All Schizophrenics.

One of the most saddening aspects of Schizophrenia is the overwhelming sense of confusion many experience.

I remember asking a kind Schizophrenic in a hospital what his name was. He looked at me, then pulled back his sleeve and beckoned me to look at his arm tag.

He didn’t know his name.

He had no idea who he was or why he was standing there.

He was still the kind soul with the same drives as a typical person, but his mind was so confused that nothing penetrated it.

That’s sad.

Those Schizophrenics are not enlightened, or if they are, they don’t know it, and that makes them even more dangerous to themselves.

How To Extract Schizophrenics from their Safety Net

There is hope for Schizophrenics, but it will not arrive in the form of some magic medicine that material reductionists believe will find that one enzyme, one gene, one whatever is the physical cause.

The cause is not physical, so material reductionists will never reach their goal.

Finding more safety net drugs is helpful, but drugs are not the answer, not a cure.

Why Schizophrenics won’t stay on drugs

Schizophrenics are among the most resistant patients when it comes to taking medications.

I feel their motivation.

If someone attempted to take away my freedom of choice and simultaneously take away what I felt was my greatest gift, I would resist that.

In fact, I would resist that with every fiber of my Being.

I hope you understand why they don’t want those drugs you believe will save them.

Schizophrenic Choices

If Schizophrenics were offered a choice, a path to get off the drugs, they will be highly motivated to follow that path, and not make a single misstep.

To a Schizophrenic, a pathway off drugs is a Stairway to Heaven.

And literally, in Mind Reality, it is a Stairway to Heaven.

Tibetan Buddhism Bridges the Divide

This wisdom comes from a very old Tradition that was nearly destroyed by the Chinese Government in one of the most atrocious acts of wonton destruction and cultural genocide in the 20th century (Shame. Shame. Shame.)

The Tibetan monks learned that in order for monks to integrate the realizations of enlightenment, Mind Reality, they needed to be firmly anchored in Body Reality, or they would become Schizophrenics.

The entire Lamrim is preparation for a new Mind Reality by providing extensive grounding.

Yes, that really is why they did it that way.

And that’s how the few remaining monks carry on.

Chanting requires feeling the Body.

Listen to a bit. You will feel it in your Body, I assure you.

https://youtu.be/S4PkLg_2clI

Body Work, Body Work, Body Work

There is only one method that Schizophrenics have to be freed from their Safety Nets and get to embrace their gift.

They must maintain the connection to Body Reality, all the time, 24/7, like non-schizophrenics.

While non-schizophrenics are trapped in Body Reality, schizophrenics have difficulty keeping in touch with Body Reality.

It’s a problem so far outside of the experience of non-schizophrenics that they don’t really grasp the problem.

I hope this explanation helps with that.

Schizophrenics still need a safety net, but rather than a material reductionist drug, they can develop mental practices and maintain them instead.

Schizophrenics, at a minimum, should meditate each day for as long as needed to feel every point in their bodies fully.

After warming up with breath meditation, which is also part of Body Work, they should scan and feel their body parts one by one.

Acknowledge their Body Reality.

Mentally check in with your little toe every day.

Massage, Massage, Massage

When the Body and Mind enjoy Harmony, the Body functions with near perfection. You experience no persistent pain, and your Qi flows freely.

When Body and Mind Harmony is lost, dis-ease is introduced to the system. Not disease as Body Reality would define it.

A lack of ease. Dis-ease.

Everyone should use Massage to maintain balance.

But it’s even more essential for Schizophrenics.

Massages are the Body’s call to Schizophrenics.

Please, please, facilitate that communication as much as possible.

(See author’s notes at bottom for more information).

More mental techniques to explore

I’ve described above the most basic, foundational technique required.

Many, many more techniques exist.

Since Schizophrenics already possess Mind Reality, they should be able to develop many more on their own if they know to look for them.

Gradual Reductions, Keep Meds for Emergencies

Over time, and with disciplined practice, Schizophrenics can start reducing the dosage of the drug they use as a safety net.

With careful observation, they can chart a safe course to freedom from the drug.

The observations should be from the Schizophrenic and from physicians and psychologists (not messed up by their material reductionist mindset) to ensure the process is safe.

If the Schizophrenic loses control, the meds are there for an emergency to restore the safety net.

Freedom

Schizophrenics really shouldn’t be too upset by the demands of the path.

They will need to maintain a strict discipline of daily bodywork for the rest of their lives, but their reward is their Freedom.

And even the Tibetan Buddhists never stopped doing Body Work.

People imagine that Enlightened Beings never have to work at anything.

Go to Tibet and ask one, and they will tell you that the work never ends; that bridge must always be maintained.

Nothing is being put on Schizophrenics that isn’t put on those who’ve bridged the divide between Body Reality and Mind Reality.

They should find comfort in that.

Enjoy with me….

meta description: "Cowardly censorship

Medium has suspended my account and pointed me to their generic terms of service, the most cowardly form of censorship imaginable.

I have no idea which of the terms I violated or how I could correct it. I specifically asked, and I was told nothing.

Since writing is about the message, censoring that message is the unforgivable sin of any platform.

Farewell.

It couldn’t be worse.

And, of course, I am not the first.

Poor Blogging Interface

Medium doesn’t have undo-redo buttons. I once lost over an hour’s work because I accidentally hit option-C rather than control-C. Medium immediately saved my mistake, and my work was irretrievably lost.

Medium has fewer style options, so text is harder to manipulate.

Medium has no images. You must supply all of your own, and if you copy any from the internet, they won’t have your back if one of those images is copyright-protected.

Medium doesn’t have a stock image library that automatically adds the proper citations.

Medium doesn’t have a gallery option.

Medium doesn’t have image generation of any kind. Substack’s image generator is powerful.

Medium doesn’t have insert capabilities for audio or video.

Medium doesn’t have any embed buttons like Substack.

Medium doesn’t have any of the more options with special inserts like Substack.

Bad User Interface

No Podcasts or Newsletters

Substack is known for these features. Medium hasn’t tried.

No Money

I don’t write for money, and I intend to make my substack free for all. But if I were motivated by money, Medium would waste my time.

Making money on Medium is rare and inconsistent.

Eighty to ninety percent of writers begin there enthusiastically but lose their excitement when they make $100 in a good month.

Medium is littered with clickbait articles about making money, none of which are valid.

Thank you, Medium

If you had not censored me when you did, It would have taken me much more time to migrate my work over to Substack and set up this website.

Now that I see how much better Substack is than Medium, I realize the future is much brighter there and here.

Happy Trails

You Are Going to Die
brown sand castle
Photo by Jaime Spaniol on Unsplash
Mostly, we go through life seeking objects of our desire, laboring under the false idea that happiness can be found in wealth, status, or a good reputation.

We expend tremendous amounts of energy toward obtaining things and attaching ourselves to them, only to find disappointment when these things don’t bring us the happiness we desire.

You’ve heard the expression, “You can’t take it with you.” And we all intellectually know that to be true, but do we really live our lives as if it were true? Consider the following story:

Some children were playing beside a river. They made castles of sand, and each child defended his castle and said, ‘This one is mine.’

They kept their castles separate and would not allow any mistakes about which was whose.

When the castles were all finished, one child kicked over someone else’s castle and completely destroyed it. The owner of the castle flew into a rage, pulled the other child’s hair, struck him with his fist and bawled out, ‘He has spoiled my castle! Come along all of you and help me punish him as he deserves.’

The others all came to his help.

They beat the child, their friend.

Then they went on playing in their sand castles, each saying, ‘This is mine; no one else may have it.

Keep away!

Don’t touch my castle!’

But evening came, it was getting dark and they all thought they ought to be going home.

No one now cared what became of his castle.

One child stamped on his, another pushed his over with both hands.

Then they turned away and went back, each to his home.

Do we act any differently than these children?

We live our lives building castles in the sand only to leave them behind as meaningless when the long night of death falls.

Imagine for a moment that you accomplished everything you wanted in life. You succeeded in all your worldly affairs.

Perhaps you’re Jeff Bezos and you’ve accumulated a $100 billion fortune.

Or perhaps you’re Tom Brady and you won seven super bowls.

While these are amazing accomplishments, both of those men will die, and when they do, they won’t be taking any of their wealth or attainments with them.

In fact, if they cling to their attainments on their deathbed, they will feel anguish and sorrow, and they will endure a great deal of suffering.

How will their worldly attainments benefit them then?

You are going to die.

You could die today.

None of your worldly attainments or possessions are important.

You won’t be taking any of it with you.

Shortly after your death, your possessions will be disbursed to various people, and your corpse will be disposed of.

A form of you remains in the memories of those who knew you. Those who outlive you may remember you kindly, or they may not.

You may have a memorial headstone, or no permanent record of you may exist at all.

Everything you worked for, struggled against, hoped, dreamed, felt — everything will be summarized by a dash between the dates on your gravestone.

Most people won’t have any more details on your life than what’s contained in that dash.

After your funeral service, most people will go back to their self-important thoughts, and thoughts of you will arise less and less often until you are finally forgotten.

A hundred years after your death, everyone who knew you will also be dead (not that they spent much time remembering you anyway), and nobody will visit your gravestone. Even your gravestone will finally be forgotten or destroyed.

All evidence of your existence will be gone.

As Styx pointed out in Nothing Ever Goes as Planned: “Even Pharaohs turn to sand, Like a drop in the ocean.”

Given these facts, why would you waste your time building castles in the sand?

Given these facts, why would you attach yourself to anything?

If you don’t attach yourself to life and worry about everything, life becomes a grand adventure full of fun and excitement.

When items you desire come to you, you enjoy them with thanks, and then you let them go.

As Freddie Mercury said in Bohemian Rhapsody: “Carry on, carry on, As if nothing really matters.”

meta description "Buddhists tend to appreciate the movie The Matrix.

In the Buddhist worldview, human existence plays out in Samsara, which is basically a simulator you can’t escape.

People who reject the Buddhist path remain blissfully unaware of the nature of reality and how they inflict pain on themselves and others.

Those who discover the Truth and choose to walk the Buddhist path have their eyes opened to a new reality.

Samsara, the Matrix, and Ready Player One are all simulations. There is no underlying reality.

In the Matrix, taking the proper pill allows you to Cross the Ultimate Divide between what we perceive as reality, Body Reality, and the reality that matters most to us, Mind Reality.

It’s a game.

Games have rules, goals, and actions.

As a practicing Buddhist, I play to uncover the only escape — become enlightened — and exit the simulation, Samsara, through its one-and-only door.

Then I never ever have to suffer again, and I can exist in a pure land of pure light.

Sounds good to me.

I want that.

meta description "Watch out for these.

As a teenager playing golf, I had to cope with my emotional immaturity to improve.

If I failed to win a tournament, I believed it was because I didn’t want it bad enough.

It is as if the universe measures out Desire, selects who has the most, and metes out rewards accordingly.

Sounds plausible, right?

Like bumper sticker wisdom.

I really believed my Desire wasn’t strong enough to motivate me to excellence.

I conceived reality that way, meditated on my Want, built really painful attachments, and suffered like mad.

Crazy!

When I didn’t win a tournament, it ballooned into a devastating emotional catastrophe. God graded me, and I came up short.

I was the embodiment of failure. Total and complete.

Ouch!

I still feel those scars.

The inflated Desire grew so powerful, I cheated — as if I suddenly lost the cognitive ability to count to 7. Desire casts a powerful spell.

I cheated against friends. People close to me. Great friend, right?

Better as my enemy.

Look what Desire made me do.

I cheated at least two or three shots, improving lies, and selectively remembering strokes played at a high school sectional qualifying tournament.

My score was one of four over two days. 647 strokes later, the scores between my school and a rival school came to a single shot.

We went to the State finals thanks to my cheating.

I sent four real golfers packing for home while I stole their opportunity.

I regret that.

meta description "This writing came from The Unbridled Joy of Special Needs Parenting

If you want to read about the Light side, I suggest you read The Many Reasons I Love My Autistic Son.

If you want to read about the Dark side, I suggest you read The Heart of Evil, the Darkest of Dark.

My biggest mistake was believing my son’s condition was an awful thing.

It’s not. And it never was. It began as a mistake, and it took me 15 years to correct it.

Best Boy in the Whole World

If you read my bio, you see that I have an adult son with cognitive disabilities, a diagnosis of autism.

He’s undeniably special. In so many ways.

His disability means he lacks sophisticated ego development.

In some ways, his mind is a pure land without some of the strong negative emotions that burden many of us.

In other ways, his mind is unrelenting chaos and confusion, leaving him completely helpless.

He requires 24-hour care.

I still hold his hand when we cross a street.

When my wife and I recognized our Fate, his condition forced a lot of unwanted spiritual growth upon us both.

The Moment We Knew He Was Autistic

We had been noticing our son was unusual since he was a baby. Most notably, we were dismayed by the lack of eye contact.

He refused to look at us.

No matter what we did, he simply wouldn’t hold our gaze.

We were new parents, but we knew that wasn’t right. We carried on in hopes it was a phase he would grow out of.

One day, my wife came across a magazine article that listed the signs of autism. My son checked every box.

My wife immediately knew.

She showed the article to me, and I immediately knew.

We didn’t take it to be good news.

https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY

The Incipient Error

We didn’t know it at the time, but in that moment of acceptance of his condition, we made a huge mistake that took us about 15 years to correct.

We thought this was bad news.

It was not.

It certainly wasn’t what we wanted. No parent wants to discover their child has limitations, serious limitations on his ability to contribute to the world or even take care of himself.

We had no shortage of friends and family willing to confirm our worst fears that our life was over and we needed to eat a shit sandwich.

We found support groups that further reinforced that we had endured this awful tragedy and someday, if we were lucky, we would develop a taste for shit sandwiches and choke them down as a badge of honor.

That’s fucked up.

This mistaken interpretation of our circumstances was the incipient error.

If I had known then what I know now, 15 years of heartache for my family could have been avoided entirely.

Saving you that 15 years of suffering is why I wrote this.

I hope you learn this lesson sooner.

If you want to really explore the power of incipient ideas, I suggest you watch the movie Inception. It’s incredible, and it makes the point I’m pointing to here better than I ever could.

https://youtu.be/YoHD9XEInc0

The Going Gets Tough

Like most parents who discover they have a problem, my wife and I set out to do something about it.

This wasn’t a bad choice.

You wouldn’t ignore your child’s illness and allow it to remain untreated.

It wasn’t our actions, it was the spirit and intention behind our actions that created problems.

Our intention was to “cure” our son. To change him.

We were rejecting who he was in favor of who we wanted him to be.

We still want him to grow and improve, and we make every effort and accommodation for him, but while striving for more, we are completely content and happy with him, just the way he is.

That was not our initial mindset. At least, I know it was not mine.

This mindset was a toxically poisonous cocktail for my heart.

I rejected my child and insisted that he be someone other than who he is.

Not openly and overtly to his face, but secretly, buried in a dark corner of my heart.

https://youtu.be/-n3sUWR4FV4

Fighting and Losing

One of the most toxic attitudes I encountered feigns Righteous goodness.

The idea that I would fight for my child no matter what and never rest until he is cured, fixed, made unbroken.

This was a commitment to rejection.

I was setting my intention on fighting a battle against accepting my son for who he was.

I didn’t persist in this notion long, fortunately.

This was a war that couldn’t be won, and the only wise course of action was not to enter into the conflict.

Drop the toxic idea that you will cure or fix your special needs child.

Sorry to state this so bluntly, but you will not succeed.

https://youtu.be/MpmGXeAtWUw

The futility of entering no-win scenarios is the key lesson from the Movie War Games. It’s a short clip. Watch and learn.

Anger, Anger, and More Anger

Whenever most people encounter something they don’t want, they get angry.

This anger may be directed at someone or something, or it may be an unfocused rage against God or Fate.

It’s victim thinking, and it distracts from the underlying sadness.

When the parent of a special needs child gets the diagnosis, all their dreams of the future collapse in a heap.

Anger is the most common initial reaction, but if any parent digs deeper what they find is an endless reservoir of sadness.

It’s a despair and pain so deep you can’t imagine surviving a plunge into that cold water.

Yet, every parent must go there, cry an ocean of tears, and cleanse the sadness from the heart.

There is no other way.

Tears wash the stains from your heart.

https://youtu.be/Soa3gO7tL-c

Green Day writes some of the finest and most moving songs I’ve encountered. Masterful. This song aptly captures the death of a parent’s dreams for their child and the despair that follows.

The Soul Death of a Thousand Slights

The experience of most special needs parents when they take their child out into the world is a death of a thousand slights.

When my son was at toddler time, he couldn’t figure out itsy-bitsy-spider. All the other children could. My wife would sit and weep, powerless to do anything about it.

Life is full of millions of those little disappointments.

When my son was 9, we purchased a gumball machine because he liked watching the gumballs circle down the track to where the gumball came out.

He kept clamoring for gumballs, so we thought we might have to get rid of it.

We didn’t need to. I simply covered it with a towel, and it disappeared.

He could walk right up to the large gumball dispenser only disguised by a thin white sheet, and it didn’t exist in his world.

That’s sad.

These experiences are repeated over, and over and over again.

Each one is a painful reminder of his limitations.

It sucked.

And the main reason it was so painful is because we failed to accept his condition.

Each incident was a reminder of how fucked up our child was.

That was doubly sad because it didn’t need to be that way.

The Lure of Snake Oil

Desperate parents searching for a cure are susceptible to all manner of ripoffs by con artists selling Snake Oil.

This is reinforced by stories such as Lorenzo’s Oil where a parent really did find a cure for an unusual medical condition through dogged research.

Every special needs parent thinks they will be the lucky one who discovers the cure.

It’s not going to happen.

https://youtu.be/O3de9LQcdnU

This scene is gripping. The worst news a parent could possible obtain.

If you have money, there is no shortage of hucksters willing to take your money.

We know a family that purchased a hyperbaric oxygen chamber for their home, thinking it would be a cure.

I installed stereo speakers on each side of my son’s crib so that I could play brainwave entrainment music to influence his brain states.

We sat through a sales pitch from a doctor who was an expert on magnetic resonance therapy. It would have cost us more than a new car.

Many parents go down the diet and nutrition rabbit hole and determine gluten or wheat is their enemy. They embark on mineral chelation therapies.

It’s not that these snake oil treatments provide no benefit, but it’s certainly true that they don’t cure autism, and they never will.

The worst part of the sales pitch is when the huckster says, “What if this was the cure? Wouldn’t you want to try and make sure?”

Playing on the emotions of desperate parents is a ticket straight to Hell. The Passionate Rage I feel, beckons me to facilitate their journey.

Accepting The Awful Truth

Parent support groups and even entire charities devoted to doing something about autism share a common mindset.

Parents must learn to accept their awful fate.

This attitude is slowly changing, at least publicly, but privately, nothing has really changed.

For the most part, parents are convinced their child is broken, and they must learn to accept a defective misfit.

That is wrong. On many levels.

https://youtu.be/Gr6GbKciNCY

This will move you. Even misfits want to bring joy to others by simply being themselves. If only their parents could accept that. Sad.

Patient Acceptance

Buddhists call the process of dissipating anger from disappointment Patient Acceptance.

When I was young, if my parents became upset because I wasn’t learning something, their displeasure strongly motivated me to figure things out.

That approach is entirely counterproductive, particularly with special needs children.

I developed endless patience, and I learned what acceptance really is through accepting him.

Love is accepting someone exactly as they are, wholeheartedly, not wanting them to be any different.

That lesson took me 15 years to learn.

I wish I could apply it to my wife. We would have less conflict.

I hope you learn it quicker than I did.

meta descriptions "I recently had an intense emotional experience that opened my mind to new ideas and helped me better understand old ones.

Through that experience, I more deeply understood the nature of endless Desire.

We all want things.

We will always want things.

Each of us must develop our own mental process for channeling that energy because at the end of that process, the emotional residual builds up.

Our moods and feelings of happiness are directly linked to our relationship to Desire, particularly Desirous Attachment, our Desire for worldly objects, attainments, and fame.

If encounters with objects of desire leave behind feelings of weakness or a lack of fulfillment, then life becomes defined by a low-grade sense of dissatisfaction, like everything is “Meh.”

https://youtu.be/ZhS-IX2CVl8

Can you relate to that hollow feeling?

If so, you aren’t alone. A man named Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, noticed 2,500 years ago.

When Buddhists talk about suffering, many laypeople think of big emotions associated with loss and grief.

But the instructions the Buddha provides in the First of the Four Noble Truths is to know your suffering,

He is pointing to this seemingly inescapable low-grade sense of dissatisfaction.

Other, more experienced practitioners may disagree, but that draining lack is how I feel this Truth today.

Academic opinions may differ.

These opinions are generally based on suspect translations formed without years of actual meditative practice.

Therefore, these opinions are sound and fury, signifying nothing.

Pay them no Mind.

The Life of a Prince

The Buddha was born a prince, so from birth, if he wanted something, there were no limitations, and he was indulged. (It must have been fun!)

As an aristocrat in the ancient world, he was a rare individual who lived an empowered life, unfettered by survival concerns.

As a prince, the Buddha had the best spiritual training of his time and abundant natural ability.

He observed his mind.

He noticed that he wasn't happy even though every whim of fancy was indulged. All the wealth in the world couldn’t buy him that.

The futility of chasing hedonistic pleasure was a spiritual dead end, and he knew it.

He knew it so deep in his heart that he couldn’t deny it.

https://youtu.be/sHWIQzd8bVw

He crossed an emotional Rubicon and couldn’t look back.

I can imagine that pivotal moment when a young prince looks at his privileged life, sees the emptiness in front of him, and thinks,

Bummer. That sucks. What can I do about it?

It wasn’t a sudden catastrophe that changed his life. He glimpsed a larger truth he could not ignore, so he spent the next several years meditating to clarify his vision.

My empowerment was sudden and spectacular, but the inflection point on life’s path doesn’t always arrive spectacularly announced.

Emptiness of Meaning

Most people don’t realize their life is a pointless waste spent chasing fleeting satisfaction they will never obtain.

(I hope this isn’t you.)

However, once the Buddha felt this in his Heart and knew it to be True, he couldn’t allow himself to waste his life.

He became the Buddha instead.

I’m not the Buddha, and I’m certainly not enlightened.

I’ve spent years studying and practicing Buddhism, and yet my intense experience increased the depth of my understanding of the meaning of this Truth.

It’s more than intellectual knowledge now.

I feel it in my heart.

meta description "I find Bumper Sticker Wisdom irritating, if you haven’t noticed.

Bumper Sticker Wisdom is generally a short quip that sounds profound and meaningful, but it lacks context as to where to apply it or why.

It feels like something important, and the advice is often good, but it lacks the essential ingredient to make it useful:

Context.

Middle Road

Buddhism is about navigating the middle road between extremes.

The classic story is based on the Buddha’s questioning a musician about tuning his guitar.

“What happens when you tune your instrument too tightly?” the Buddha asked.

“The strings break,” the musician replied.

“And what happens when you string it too loosely?”

“When it’s too loose, no sound comes out,” the musician answered. “The string that produces a tuneful sound is not too tight and not too loose.”

“That,” said the Buddha, “is how to practice: not too tight and not too loose.”

The elegant simplicity of this story illustrates the middle road is a path between two extremes.

I envision it as the two ditches on the side of the road.

Two Ditches

Bumper Sticker Wisdom is general advice designed to avoid one of these two ditches.

He who hesitates is lost.

Look before you leap.

Both examples of Bumper Sticker Wisdom contain good advice.

If your problem is a lack of confidence to take action, you’re struggling with ditch #1, and the Bumper Sticker Wisdom, “He who hesitates is lost,” will help you.

If your problem is impetuousness and acting without due consideration, then you’re struggling with ditch #2, and “Look before you leap” will help you.

The only way to know is if you have context for your actions.

Bumper sticker wisdom can keep you in the ditch.

If you have problems with ditch #1, and you lack confidence, then bumper sticker wisdom #2, “Look before you leap,” will make your problems worse!

That’s why Bumper Sticker Wisdom can be harmful.

Bullshit generators

Bumper Sticker Wisdom is such a widespread problem that some clever programmers have come up with bullshit generators designed to produce it.

The Deepak Chopra Nonsense Generator demonstrates how much of his “wisdom” is merely vapid nonsense and dressed-up bumper sticker wisdom.

The Deepak Chopra Nonsense Generator takes actual quotes from him and puts them together in a random fashion. It works.

“The secret of the universe is an ingredient of dimensionless boundaries”

“Perception drives intrinsic chaos”

“The key to joy opens subtle human observation”

“Self power differentiates into ephemeral abstract beauty”

So deep.

Wow! It's mind-blowing, really profound.

Bumper sticker wisdom.

New Age Bullshit Generator

New Age Bullshit Generator is another favorite.

Allow me to hit the reionize electrons button and dazzle you.

The goal of a resonance cascade is to plant the seeds of interconnectedness rather than bondage.

Love is the driver of wellbeing. You and I are adventurers of the quantum soup.

Dogma is the antithesis of flow.

Humankind has nothing to lose. Who are we? Where on the great story will we be guided? Throughout history, humans have been interacting with the grid via molecular structures.

Yes, it is possible to extinguish the things that can obliterate us, but not without stardust on our side. Without rebirth, one cannot vibrate. The complexity of the present time seems to demand a redefining of our lives if we are going to survive.

We grow, we grow, we are reborn. The biosphere is radiating morphogenetic fields. Nothing is impossible.

It is a sign of things to come.

The revolution of growth is now happening worldwide. We are being called to explore the solar system itself as an interface between life and hope. Soon there will be a blossoming of karma the likes of which the dreamtime has never seen.

Doesn’t that sound profound?

Bumper Sticker Wisdom, on steroids.

https://youtu.be/5iusMCeYTro

Colossal structures of mental masturbation

I have a close friend who is a professed Stoic.

Based on my conversations with him, I’ve softened my views on Stoicism because he emotionally internalizes it and brings it into his heart.

That is more the exception than the rule, in my opinion.

There are many Stoic writers, and I don’t read any that I like, not since Marcus Aurelius.

I find much of stoicism writing mental masturbation. Writers are living in their heads.

Missing the Heart

The reason I favor Tibetan Buddhism is simple.

It’s entirely focused on transferring wisdom and intellectual knowledge to feelings in the heart to guide your way.

When catastrophe hits, stoics will consult their rulebook of wisdom, but they won’t read much through their tears, and the words will feel empty.

If your philosophy fails when you need it most, what value does it have?

I’m not pronouncing final judgment here, and if stoics find their philosophy really helps them when the chips are down, great!

I certainly don’t want to take that from anyone.

However, if I were to advise someone on what they should focus on to clean up their heart, Tibetan Buddhism is what I would direct them to.

Heart Wisdom is superior.

It never leaves you, and it never disappoints.

meta description "A story of Spiritual transformation and the power of money and mana.

I won the lottery… sort of.

I unexpectedly received a large monthly annuity that will comfortably support my family for life.

There was no lump sum, so I couldn’t buy a beachfront mansion or go on a wild spending spree, but the monthly annuity more than triples my family’s monthly income, and since I was comfortable before, every penny of that extra income is discretionary spending.

I haven’t quit work, but if I do, my income still more than doubles.

Imagine you didn’t need to spend any of your monthly income on bills (or work to obtain it). Every penny of that income can be spent on what you want rather than what you need.

That’s my life now!

How would you feel if your financial worries were eliminated in a single moment?

What Would Buddha Do?

Practicing Buddhists strive to eliminate their attachments to reach enlightenment.

So, how would a practicing Buddhist react to an enormous financial windfall?

Would all that crap about eliminating Attachments get buried under a mountain of money?

As an experienced meditator, I carefully observed my reactions out of habit and training even as the emotions overtook me. And I’m still observing the after-effects today.

It’s that emotional experience I share with complete honesty and candor.

Please don’t reveal me or dox me as a challenge. I value my anonymity. Please, honor me in this way if you enjoy this work.

And realistically, if my mind or heart were wired for fame, I would lose touch with the feelings I write about here.

Channeling Polyhymnia’s voice is a tremendous writing experience.

I honor it.

Desiring fame, her voice would fall silent. I don’t want that.

That’s the Spiritual Teacher’s Paradox. If you Want it, you can’t have it.

It’s the downfall of every Spiritual fraud.

Life Changing

I write because this was a tremendous, life-changing, exhilarating emotional experience — an experience that, unfortunately, very few people have.

And it’s the kind of story I want to read!

Relax, there will be zero gloating in my good fortune.

Dirty Words

If you read some “dirty” words, before you collapse in Righteous disbelief, note that these words carry POWER.

Fuck yeah, they do!

That naughty little word aptly captures a sudden burst of anger or excitement.

And everyone gets it.

I won’t destroy the World’s experience to appeal to your tender sensibilities.

Accept it.

Abandon Resistance.

Feel Peace.

It’s a simple, three-step process.

Reader Preparatory Instructions

If you were planning a trip to the moon, you would prepare accordingly, pack your bags, and so on.

This work is a long, emotionally engaging read that emerged over weeks of inspiration and craft, driven by the energy unleashed by an empowering financial windfall.

This is not writing you scan for information.

If you want intellectual engagement, philosophical debate, or mental masturbation, this work isn’t for you.

Pack up now and leave.

I shit you not. You won’t get any of this.

Go away.

I don’t want to waste your time.

Journey

This work is a journey.

A journey through the depths of the human heart.

Don’t skip around, jump sections, and think you’ve absorbed it. Take it sequentially, as presented.

The flow matters.

Emotional work takes time.

If you need a break, when you share button, you are at a rest stop. If you are enjoying the post, share it.

Share

That’s a place where you can take an emotional breather and you can re-enter the flow of the work without missing a beat.

The share button is better than a commercial.

You will also see many videos. I suggest you stop and watch at least a few moments of them to capture the mood.

Music moves.

Music Feels.

You’ll notice unusual capitalization. The Muse feels that capitalization on specific emotions like Love signals that I’m referring to the larger, more profound meaning.

I love to write about Love.

Don’t be distracted by the capitalization and wonder why I don’t follow the rules of grammar.

Please consider that a Pure Heart needs no rules. It always follows the proper course.

I set your reader expectations very high. I’ve experienced this work many, many times during the writing process.

It moves me.

I believe it will move you too.

So take a breath, relax, and get ready to blast off!

Shock and Awe

Like a lottery winner, I didn’t know this was coming.

I was lucky.

Since I didn’t foresee this, I had no way to prepare emotionally.

Like a lottery winner, there was a specific moment when I realized my life changed.

No dramatic anticipation of a televised announcement, but I received an email detailing the monthly stipend, and when I saw the number, life stopped.

https://youtu.be/ZBAijg5Betw

A moment of “Does not compute” followed by…

OMG!

No wait… That can’t be right…

OMG! OMG! OMG!

Are you sure… No…

Yes? YES! OMG!

YES!!!

YES TO EVERYTHING!

Elation!

Elation, so strong and powerful, my heart raced, my adrenal glands emptied, and every muscle wanted to move.

I jumped, chest up, face to the heavens, and expelled a bellow that deafened my neighbors.

Empowerment!

The moment the elation ebbed, I felt the underlying power.

POWER!

Money is power. Pure power.

The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want!

You gain an outsized ability to bend reality to your liking.

The testosterone release hit me so hard that images of the Incredible Hulk pounded my mind.

https://youtu.be/DIhrvt8o2io

Yeah, that video nails it.

Anticipation! Excitement!

My future visions immediately changed (my forehead heated notably for weeks).

My life would be amazing — better than my previously limited dreams — not in an imaginative, wouldn’t-it-be-nice kind of way, but in a concrete, tangible reality.

Fantasy plus reality equals exhilaration!

Wow!

https://youtu.be/TUCk9jK-xsU

This experience is captured the original Count of Monte Cristo, time index 48:45 to 50:15. Richard Chamberlain expresses it powerfully.

The World is Mine!!!

Unfortunately, I’m not Richard Chamberlain, so my moment of initial empowerment was somewhat less polished.

My mind jumped to AC/DC Back in Black, and I rocked! Oh how I ROCKED!!!

https://youtu.be/pAgnJDJN4VA

AC/DC, You channel Pure Passion. Rock On!

Hearing my old adrenaline-pumping favorite with the added financial meaning of “in the black,” I danced in my living room looking like a drunken chimpanzee on roller skates.

I made Elaine from Seinfeld look graceful and talented.

But I danced. I danced, and I didn’t care.

https://youtu.be/jsl3IBAsEH4

Julia Louis-Dreyfus, People will remember that dance forever! It took Courage to do that. Most people couldn’t endure the ridicule and embarrassment. Kudos!

Yes to Everything

The initial euphoria caused a state of mental fog.

A thousand Desirous thoughts are suddenly activated with new importance, and each desire competes for conscious attention.

Observation is difficult.

Even an experienced meditator is powerless to direct, divert, or in any way harness the mental chaos in moments like this.

Like a rodeo cowboy, you hang on, rely on your spiritual training and practice, and go for the ride.

I sat down after dancing and found the thoughts concerning objects of Desire were loud and insistent. My desires, accustomed to being trapped in Pandora’s Box, screamed for release.

I opened the box, consulted my wish list, and I noticed the first and most impactful change to my psychology.

Suddenly, the answer to everything was YES!

Share

Your Wish List

Indulge me in a brief thought experiment. Consult your shopping wish list, look at something you want, and observe your emotions.

In that first moment, you will feel a flush of Desire; after all, you are looking at something you want.

In the next moment, the counterbalancing force arises and informs your consciousness that you can’t afford it.

When your mind evaluates that thought, it will agree, and in accepting that information, the flush of desire morphs into a combination of frustration, longing, and dissatisfaction.

Life sucks.

Have you ever paid careful attention to that process?

Most people haven’t. It happens very quickly.

Desire lurks in dark places.

Willful Ignorance

Be careful you avoid the hypnotic trance of willful ignorance toward desire.

At first, it feels better to avoid feeling desire, taking on the persona of a Holy Being, above such worldly temptations.

But this gives desire a unique Power. It can cast a spell on you so that you don’t notice when it takes the helm of the ship and pilots you into the rocks.

In this way, you can be secretly completely selfish and yet convince yourself you’re seated at the Right Hand of God.

It’s a wonderful delusion, full of pixies and rainbows.

https://youtu.be/R3ZJKN_5M44

Dont Buy Stuff You Can’t Afford is pure comic genius! It perfectly captures the hypnotic trance of Willful Ignorance toward Desire.

As a bonus, it completely explains everything you need to know about managing Money!

Awesome!

What’s Old is New Again

When I looked at my wish list, my mind dutifully prompted me to feel Desire. In the next moment, my mind habitually reminded me that I can’t afford it.

Ahh…. but then, my mind evaluated that idea with new information.

Now, I can afford it.

Instead of following that well-worn pathway of feeling deflated, my mind said, “Yes, you can have that now.” It didn’t compute.

Wait. I’m confused. What was that?

Yes, you can have that now.

Really? I can have that?

Yeah. Why not?

WOW! OMG! YES!

https://youtu.be/KrdHBCJe14I

This Family Rules! Exchanging Self with Other 101.

I looked at the next object and noticed the same phenomenon. And the next one, and the next one. Finally, I noticed the answer was consistent.

Yes.

Yes to everything.

YES TO EVERYTHING!!!

Power up! Next Level! OMG!

My poor adrenals were blasted again and again and again.

I spent the next hour mentally shopping.

I emotionally purchased the Internet.

As each object of my desire was served up, my mind broke the old “you can’t afford this” pattern, and with each instance, I felt a euphoric adrenaline rush.

I was a crack addict who couldn’t put down the pipe.

It was as exhilarating as you can imagine.

After several hours, I felt like a Roman aristocrat leaving Caligula’s Nemi ship, pleasured beyond all expectations.

Roman orgy

Golf is Life

I love Golf.

My father set me loose to wander the Sacred Links at age 9. My grandfather maintained the grounds.

Golf intrigues me because it’s a rare competitive sport where your opponent's actions don’t impact your outcome. It isn’t a miniature simulation of war, like most of our popular entertainment.

Golf is you against yourself.

It’s a perfect mirror of your inner life.

It’s a disciplined part of my spiritual practice.

If you want to know a person’s character, observe them for a round of golf, and all will be revealed.

Pilgrimage to Pebble Beach in 1997. Standing on Sacred Ground.

An Emotional Orgasm

With my passion for the game, energized with empowerment, I looked up a travel package to Scotland to play the Open rota courses.

It’s a bucket list item — I started mine at 9 with this item.

It carries emotional juice.

As per the new process, I checked with my mind. A pregnant pause.

Wait? That too?

Sure. Why not. You can afford it.

Wow! YES!

The sudden jolt stopped my heart, literally. I had to prompt myself to breathe.

The euphoric boost launched me into orbit. I landed on the first tee of the Old Course, and I hit a tee shot over the moon and back again.

It was incredible!

I must admit, I let that feeling linger for a while, like the afterglow of an intense emotional orgasm.

https://youtu.be/1k8craCGpgs

Hold the Feeling

Per my meditation training, I’m instructed to hold the feeling as long as possible when I feel virtue.

By holding sacred feelings, you burn them into your heart more deeply.

I’m well-practiced at holding feelings in my heart.

That training both served me and harmed me.

First, it served me because, quite frankly, the experience felt fantastic.

But I also knew it was harming me because I was meditating on non-virtue — my own personal greed. I was burning the wrong things into my heart.

But, you know what, I didn’t give a fuck! It was too fun!!!

Desire won that battle.

There was glory in defeat.

https://youtu.be/Ef9QnZVpVd8

Life Limits

I futilely attempted to satiate my Desires — knowing I was scurrying down a rabbit hole.

However, I noticed the mental process changed, but there were still limits, and suddenly new questions emerged.

Like all feelings, it arose, reached a peak, and faded. And in the aftermath, a new question emerged: “Do you have time for that?”

Hmmm…

Wait. That might be a problem…

My mind stopped for a moment. This was the first downer I had to accept.

I am limited by time.

https://youtu.be/dO1rMeYnOmM

Hauntingly beautiful song with a really important message.

Crap! I can’t do everything!

I giggled at myself and went back to my search.

But after a time, I noticed that I still had a wish list, but the items on that list were there for reasons other than money, like not having time to enjoy it or the space to store it.

Items fell off.

Right now, it’s empty.

If my want is appropriate, I go buy it. No need to keep a list.

I live in the now.

This video is too long, and Eckhart Tolle never rushes anything, if you know what I mean. That being said, you can’t over-listen to him.

Eckhart Tolle, You are my spiritual Master. I commuted for years listening to every hour of every talk available. Repeatedly. Your wisdom seeped in, even when my attention waned. I would be deeply honored to sit quietly with you.

The Void

Several years ago, I arranged my life to spend several hundred hours in float tanks practicing Lamrim in total sensory deprivation.

Yeah, I know you thought I was odd.

That may have something to do with it.

Through years of meditation practice, I learned to hear the distant streams in my mind.

The voices and forces I animate dramatically are both the raging rivers and the quiet voices, barely noticeable, difficult to tune.

I had time to meditate in sensory isolation — lots of time. I developed a sensitive radio dial.

It’s a practiced skill, nothing more.

Like hitting golf balls.

https://youtu.be/qV8A49GvqMw

I marvel at the Power of the mind. Anyone who devotes time to practice can achieve this.

I’m not the first. The Buddha achieved this 2,500 years ago and went way, way beyond.

He taught meditation.

The monks who’ve been following his footsteps ever since, same thing.

You are more powerful than you realize.

Much more powerful.

I’m odd.

But it’s the kind of Odd that piques your interest, doesn’t it?

A Big Event

After the news settled in, for about a month, I was on a major high, but then something even weirder happened.

But before I go into the details, additional background information is needed to understand why I enjoyed an intense spiritual awakening.

The Voices in My Head

I hear voices in my head. A casual reader might conclude I am psychotic, hallucinating my reality.

I am.

The consensus of modern neuroscience says I’m hallucinating Me.

https://youtu.be/qV8A49GvqMw

This video is worth watching all the way through, many times over to absorb it’s Truth. Long version even better.

Anil Seth, I salute you! Everything I understand about neuroscience I owe to you. You are a Giant who’s shoulders I stand on.

When you read my descriptions of voices in my mind, these aren’t the loud, insistent voices of schizophrenia.

The mind processes feelings more than thoughts. These feelings can be associated with voice, but often, it takes concentration on aptness to match voice to feeling.

I can give voice to feelings if I can parse their effect from the chorus of feelings and thoughts in my mind.

It takes careful, mindful observation.

But I have no special gift. Anyone can learn this with enough time and focused concentration.

Existing as a disembodied mind in a float tank free from distractions certainly helps.

Enter Zen from There

An apt analogy comes from a Zen Buddhist story.

Master and disciple sit in meditation. The Master was calm, peaceful, open to life. The disciple was uneasy, his mind aflutter.

The disciple asks, “Master, How do I enter Zen?”

The Master sits and listens. Meanwhile, the disciple’s mind is agitated by impatience for an answer.

Photo by Luke Vodell on Unsplash

The Master finally says, “Do you hear the mountain stream?”

The disciple turned his attention away from his disturbing thoughts and listened for the distant, faint sounds of cascading water.

He observed.

He became peaceful.

His mind fell silent as he focused on observation.

After some time and focused concentration, the disciple heard the stream.

Excited, the disciple exclaims, “Yes! Master, I can hear the stream.”

The master replied. “Enter Zen from there.”

(the end)

Jack Kornfield, The Roots of Buddhist Psychology was Buddhism 101 for me. I’ve listened to all 9 hours many, many times!

Empowerment

In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, practitioners attend large group events called Empowerments.

In these ceremonies, the practitioner is invited to accept a God-like image of a Buddha into their heart to attain specific benefits.

This is preparation for Tantra, the practice of emulating God’s or the best qualities of the Buddha.

You fake it until you make it in modern parlance.

Being a voracious reader and impatient with bureaucracies, I obtained the Mahamudra Tantra book and started practicing independently.

I gave myself all empowerments, and I worked on everything.

Some practitioners would chastise me and question my realizations, but most recognize that my realizations are what they are.

Conditions For Awakening

Eckhart Tolle in The Power of Now describes his awakening.

He bathed in an emotional cesspool of anxiety and toxic shame that created conditions for the spontaneous collapse of his ego.

It sounded rather unpleasant.

I wouldn’t want to follow his path.

https://youtu.be/6qAgSdE7hI8

This is long, but worth the time invested.

Eckhart Tolle’s awakening was sudden and completely unexpected, and he did nothing to bring it about.

If the conditions are right, this can happen, but there are no guarantees. He might have suffered the rest of his life like so many others.

I had something similar occur to me.

When I Won the Lottery as I described it, I suddenly enjoyed a much higher level of Qi flow.

I was excited.

This excitement coursing through me for several weeks caused all manner of internal changes.

Practicing Tibetan Buddhism planted seeds in my mind. My sudden financial good fortune watered those seeds.

The seeds sprouted.

All at once.

Empowered!

At about 5:30 one evening, I felt forces brewing inside of me that were building to something. I didn’t know what it was, but I strongly suspected I was about to have an intense emotional experience.

I gathered my family around me, and I began hugging and later jumping while embracing my 22-year-old special needs son.

My son loves me unconditionally, and his love and mine combined to bring about the emergence.

It was beautiful.

After some manic yelling and a few aftershocks, over the course of about 15 minutes, the process was complete.

I was empowered.

OMG! I was really, really Empowered!!!

My heart light ignited, and I was ablaze!

https://youtu.be/BE5s2ALDr58

Steven Spielberg, The moment ET’s Heart lit up, my heart burst open and flooded me with joy. Thank you. It was beautiful. You’re amazing!

You helped me prepare.

Please listen to that song as you read on. It will help you feel what I felt.

Emotional Quasar

In the moments of first empowerment, right after the euphoria ebbed slightly, and I perceived the raw Qi power flowing through me, all my chakras were blown open, but my heart chakra channeled most of that flow.

I am grateful for my training.

To make sense of the chaos, my mind instinctively jumped to a Lamrim meditation I practice often to provide an outlet for the extreme inflow. The instructions for the meditation capture what happened.

… through the power of our pure intention of wishing love and great accumulation of merit… Infinite light rays radiate from our body and pervade the entire universe, reaching the bodies and minds of all living beings and bestowing upon them the supreme happiness of permanent inner peace.

My heart felt like a quasar radiating light with such intensity that it outshone the entire Milky Way galaxy by a thousand times!

OMG!!!

Per my training, I held that feeling as long as I could, holding it, feeling it, watching it, marveling at the Power!

It was incredible!!!

Perhaps you felt my Blessing?

I assure you I did.

Imagine that experience!

Blast Off!!!

Geshe Kelsang Gyatso- 1931–2022, RIP. You were the bridge between our cultures. I owe you everything. I felt your Love. Thank you.

I request one last Blessing: Please, find me in the Bardo and guide me on my journey. I will navigate by the Power of your Radiant Light.

Take a break; that was intense.

Ponder this: Do pork chops float?

Behold the power of a jarring non-sequitur to clear your mind.

After the Ecstacy, the Laundry

Jack Kornfield wrote After the Ecstacy, the Laundry, describing the return to mundane life after a peak experience.

I had to return to my life and see if the feeling lasted and what skills and realizations remained.

So far, there has been little or no change in my emotional state since the experience.

I’ve calmed down, but if anything, my heart and mind race faster today.

In fact, many of the new skills have sharpened as my mind integrates more data and continues processing at lightning speed.

Whenever I am out in public, I find people gravitate to me.

Previously, I was a loner, content to be invisible. Now, people can’t seem to avoid noticing me.

It’s odd.

I now possess skills in team building and personal persuasion I previously lacked, probably related to the above increase in my charisma.

I also noticed a dramatic improvement in my ability to analyze situations that require strategy or military combat.

I guess the Art of War and the Prince combined with my game theory and statistics studies.

My diet went from good to perfect.

My heart rate went from 50–60 BPM to 90–100 BPM, so my metabolism and caloric burn are off the charts.

It’s like I’m on speed without the drug.

I lost 35 pounds over the last year (started before all of this) and now sustain a trim 158–160 pound frame.

I went to see psychiatrists at the urging of my family.

Unsurprisingly, that was a mistake.

The signs of a spiritual awakening are also the signs of a health condition the medical community aggressively treats with medication.

Better to have this experience in India or Tibet, where people recognize it for what it is.

The medical establishment wants to drug the joy out of me.

I have been officially diagnosed based on multiple interviews with professionals with various levels of medical training through a fully licensed psychiatrist.

I am bipolar and prone to mania. I currently suffer from an extreme case of mania.

They strongly suggest I take drugs to suppress my mental activity.

Apparently, extreme happiness is a sign of a mental disorder.

Type 1 Bipolar is sometimes characterized by mania followed by a fall to a normal baseline on a repeating cycle.

Mania is my new baseline.

That’s what differs. There is no fall to a lower state.

I wouldn’t have guessed happiness is diagnosed as bipolar.

But in retrospect, I observe that few people are genuinely happy, so I understand why true happiness is perplexing to Western doctors.

I find their opinions amusing since they mean so little to me.

I am working with my personal physician to gather enough data points to establish a new medical definition.

I am bipolar with constant and unrelenting mania of only the positive pole.

The criteria for this particular diagnosis are challenging to meet.

The patient must always be jubilantly happy and totally excited to be alive.

The patient must display boundless energy and perfect physical health.

The patient must have at least 20 years of disciplined meditation practice; Buddhist or Indian mysticism is preferred, Tibetan Buddhism being the gold standard.

The patient must be interviewed by other Tibetan Buddhist practitioners (or whatever mystic branch is involved) who provide 3rd party legitimacy.

It’s a high bar.

If enough time passes and the mania fails to subside, and the other pole is never even glimpsed, I am convinced the new diagnosis will stick.

You never know; the medical community is very committed to their erroneous point of view.
