Aristocratic rule refers to a form of government where power is held by a small, privileged class known as the aristocracy. This group is often distinguished by noble birth, wealth, and social status. Aristocracies have been a common form of governance throughout history, particularly in monarchies where nobility held significant influence.

In an aristocratic system, rulers are typically chosen based on lineage, with titles and privileges often being hereditary. The aristocrats usually have special rights and hold a higher social status than the rest of the population. This class system can lead to a significant division between the ruling elite and the general populace.

Aristocratic rule is often contrasted with democratic rule, where power is vested in the people either directly or through elected representatives. In modern times, pure aristocratic systems are rare, as most societies have moved towards more democratic or egalitarian forms of governance. However, elements of aristocracy can still be observed in the political and social structures of some countries, where elite groups hold disproportionate power and influence.<br>
