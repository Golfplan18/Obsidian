Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI), also known as human swarming, is a technology that enables networked human groups to combine their knowledge, insights, and intuitions in real-time to form a unified emergent intelligence. This process is modeled after natural swarms, such as those of bees or birds, where decentralized agents interact to produce collective behaviors that are more intelligent than individual actions. In ASI, participants are connected through a platform that allows them to collaboratively make decisions, predictions, or assessments, effectively creating a "hive mind." citeturn0search18

The concept of ASI is rooted in swarm intelligence, a field of artificial intelligence that studies how simple agents following basic rules can lead to complex collective behaviors without centralized control. In biological systems, this is observed in ant colonies, bird flocking, and fish schooling. ASI applies these principles to human groups, leveraging AI algorithms to facilitate real-time collaboration and decision-making. citeturn0search0

Research has demonstrated that ASI can amplify the collective intelligence of human groups, leading to more accurate forecasts, assessments, and decisions. For instance, studies have shown that groups using ASI platforms can outperform traditional methods in tasks such as medical diagnoses and financial forecasting. citeturn0search19

In summary, Artificial Swarm Intelligence harnesses the power of collective human input, guided by AI algorithms, to enhance decision-making processes across various domains. <br>
