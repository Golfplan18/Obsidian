The connection between beauty and happiness has been a subject of interest throughout history, and there are several notable examples of individuals who struggled with the fading of their physical beauty:

1. **Marilyn Monroe**: An iconic symbol of beauty and glamour in the 20th century, Marilyn Monroe's life was marked by personal struggles and a sense of unhappiness that deepened as she aged. Despite her immense popularity and the adoration she received for her beauty, her later years were marred by depression and substance abuse, partly driven by the pressures of maintaining her image.
2. **Cleopatra**: The last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, Cleopatra was famed for her intelligence, political acumen, and her reputed beauty. Her romantic liaisons with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony are legendary. However, as the power dynamics of the ancient world shifted and her influence waned, Cleopatra's life ended in tragedy, which some interpretations attribute in part to the loss of her youth and beauty.
3. **Lord Byron**: The famous poet was renowned for his good looks and charismatic personality, which contributed to his status as one of the leading figures of the Romantic movement. However, as he aged and his health declined, he became increasingly unhappy. His later life was marked by weight struggles, a sense of disillusionment, and a decline in his public image.
4. **Greta Garbo**: A major film star in the 1920s and 1930s, Garbo was known for her alluring beauty and the mystery that surrounded her. As she aged, she became increasingly reclusive, retiring from the film industry in her mid-thirties. Her retreat from public life was partly attributed to her desire to maintain the image of beauty and mystery that had defined her career.
5. **Elvis Presley**: The King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley was also known for his good looks and charismatic stage presence. As he aged, his health deteriorated due in part to drug use and unhealthy lifestyle choices. His struggle with weight gain and declining health in his later years contrasted sharply with the vibrant, handsome image he maintained in his youth, contributing to his unhappiness.

These examples demonstrate that beauty, while celebrated, can also bring its own set of challenges, especially as it fades with time. The pressure to maintain a youthful appearance and the fear of losing one's beauty can lead to significant emotional distress, impacting overall happiness.<br>
