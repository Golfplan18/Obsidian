meta description "The US Food and Drug Administration has published a warning for parents to beware of false or misleading claims about HBOT for treating autism.

I know a family who purchased a hyperbaric oxygen chamber for their home to treat their son with autism.

It was expensive. A cheap one costs about $10,000, and some go as high as $40,000. Desperate parents are easily swayed into purchasing the more expensive models.

They did their research, which meant they went to Google and absorbed the various snake oil sales pitches. When they saw doctors who touted scientific studies backing their dubious claims, they were convinced the therapy had promise.

It did nothing.

At first, the imagined improvements strengthened their belief that they had found the cure. Their son’s health appeared better; they noticed more eye contact, and they believed he was on the mend.

Confirmation bias works that way.

They told their friends and other parents about their great discovery and their hopes for a “cure” to their son’s autism.

However, when they asked the specialists and therapists who worked with their son regularly about his progress, none reported any significant change.

After a few months, their enthusiasm waned, and they began questioning whether or not this was a cure.

They maintained their belief that the procedure improved his health for many more months, mostly as a way of rationalizing they made the right decision in purchasing the hyperbaric oxygen chamber and putting their son in it daily.

However, the objective reality was ultimately undeniable.

They purchased the chamber to cure their son. They kept it because they believed it improved his health. When they finally accepted that it made no difference, they were shattered.

They were heartbroken for two reasons.

One, they believed erroneously that they could transform their non-neurotypical son into what they wanted him to be. Their dreams of a perfect son were revealed as illusions.

Two, they were embarrassed because they told so many people, and convinced other parents of the efficacy of a treatment that turned out to be snake oil.

They certainly were not alone. It’s a trap nearly every special needs parent falls into, me included."<br>

The meta description you've provided seems to summarize a personal account or story related to a family's experience with using hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for treating autism. The description touches upon their initial hope and belief in the treatment, the disappointment they faced when it did not lead to significant improvements, and the emotional and social consequences of their experience.

If this is intended for a web page or article, it effectively conveys the central theme and emotions involved in the story, which can potentially engage readers who are interested in autism treatments and the challenges faced by parents of children with special needs. However, it's essential to ensure that the full article provides a balanced perspective, including any relevant scientific information or expert opinions on HBOT as a treatment for autism to help readers make informed decisions.<br>
