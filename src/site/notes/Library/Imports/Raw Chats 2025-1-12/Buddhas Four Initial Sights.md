When Siddhartha Gautama, who later became known as the Buddha, left his palace for the first time, he encountered four significant sights. These sights are traditionally referred to as the "Four Sights" in Buddhist texts, and they played a crucial role in his spiritual journey. The four sights are:

1. **An Old Man**: This sight confronted Siddhartha with the reality of aging. He realized that all beings age and that youth and health are temporary.
2. **A Sick Man**: Seeing a person suffering from illness made Siddhartha aware of the pervasiveness of sickness in the world and the inescapable nature of physical suffering.
3. **A Corpse**: The sight of a dead body brought the reality of death to Siddhartha's consciousness. He recognized that death is inevitable and comes to all living beings.
4. **An Ascetic**: Finally, Siddhartha saw a holy man or ascetic, who appeared serene and at peace. This sight inspired him to embark on a spiritual quest to find the path to liberation from suffering, aging, sickness, and death.

These encounters are said to have deeply affected Siddhartha, leading him to renounce his princely life and seek enlightenment, which eventually led to the founding of Buddhism.<br>

<i>[1/5/2024, 12:36:15 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: how long after his enlightenment did the buddha wait to start teaching<br>
<i>[1/5/2024, 12:36:24 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

After attaining enlightenment, it is said that the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, waited for seven weeks before he began to teach. He initially hesitated to teach because he was concerned that the profound insights he had realized under the Bodhi tree might be too difficult for others to understand.

According to Buddhist tradition, during these seven weeks, the Buddha spent his time in various forms of contemplation and meditation, reflecting on the nature of his awakening and the suffering inherent in human existence. He was eventually persuaded to teach after being convinced that there were those who could understand his message. 

His first teaching, known as the "Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta" or "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma," was given at the Deer Park in Sarnath, near Varanasi in India. This teaching laid down the core principles of Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.<br>
