paraphrase in third person "Buddhism is different: Itâ€™s a path of choice.

You either choose to feel Karmaâ€™s navigating field or you donâ€™t.

Hereâ€™s how it works.

If I truly believed my actions were absolutely going to come back to me in some form or fashion, and there was no escape, none, no dodging responsibilityâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhen I felt that hit my heartâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI didnâ€™t want to inflict my selfish desires on anyone.

The Power of Karma is its ability to prevent me from hurting others.

I use it as a mind hack.

A useful tool to drive my motivation toward virtue.

When you learn to navigate by it Karma is an excellent moral compass, a needle aligning your heart True North, pointing you down the Proper Path."<br>

In the realm of Buddhism, individuals are presented with a unique approach to life. One has the option to embrace or reject the influence of Karma, which serves as a guiding force. The fundamental concept works as follows: If a person genuinely believes that their actions will inevitably return to them in some manner, with no possibility of evading accountability, they are compelled to consider the consequences deeply. This realization, when it deeply resonates within their being, dissuades them from imposing their self-centered desires upon others.

The potency of Karma lies in its capacity to dissuade individuals from causing harm to others. It serves as a psychological tool that the person employs, leveraging it to bolster their commitment to virtuous behavior. When one learns to navigate their life guided by Karma, it becomes an invaluable moral compass, akin to a needle that steadfastly directs their heart toward True North, guiding them along the righteous path.<br>

paraphrase in third person "Live-with-no-regrets is the anthem of Desire. Itâ€™s not wise spiritual advice.

A life without regrets represents a failure to learn from mistakes.

For many years, I would seduce my wife, subtly coercing her into pleasing me when she really didnâ€™t want to.

It isnâ€™t a virtuous behavior. I put my selfish desire over her needs and wants.

I would not have been happy if the roles had been reversed.

For many years, I continually inflicted subtle emotional pain on my life partner.

I didnâ€™t feel that pain because I didnâ€™t consider her experience, and I likely would have convinced myself I wasnâ€™t responsible for her reaction.

I felt no regret.

When I looked honestly at the behavior, an unpleasant feeling of revulsion arose.

The deeper I dug, the more intense I felt that pain.

Most people recoil when they feel the unpleasant feelings of remorse.

I use it as a warning sign.

Itâ€™s telling me that I am considering a behavior that has caused others pain in the past.

If I continue down this path, I am likely to do something that will make me feel that pain with more intensity.

Donâ€™t do it.

Just say no."<br>

The motto "Live-with-no-regrets" embodies the essence of Desire, but it falls short as a sound spiritual guidance.

Living a life devoid of regrets signifies a failure to derive wisdom from one's mistakes.

For numerous years, the individual would allure their spouse, subtly pressuring them into satisfying their own desires when the spouse was not genuinely inclined to do so.

This conduct lacks virtue, as it prioritizes selfish desires over the needs and desires of the spouse.

The individual acknowledges that they would not have found contentment had the roles been reversed.

Over an extended period, the individual consistently inflicted subtle emotional distress upon their life partner.

They remained oblivious to this pain, as they did not consider their partner's perspective, and they may have even convinced themselves that they were not responsible for their partner's reactions.

At that time, no feelings of regret were experienced.

However, upon honest reflection on their behavior, an unpleasant sensation of disgust emerged.

The more they delved into this introspection, the more intense this inner turmoil became.

Typically, most individuals recoil when confronted with the uncomfortable emotions associated with remorse.

In this case, the individual views these feelings as a cautionary signal.

Remorse serves as a warning that they are contemplating an action that has caused pain to others in the past.

Continuing down this path would likely result in experiencing that pain with even greater intensity.

The advice is clear: refrain from pursuing such actions and simply decline.<br>

<i>[12/29/2023, 3:04:12 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: 

paraphrase in third person "100% Responsible
Once I started navigating by Karma, I took 100% responsibility for everything that occurred to me.

Why? Because if I act unwisely, hurt people, or do bad things, itâ€™s all going to come back to bite me in the ass.

I donâ€™t want that.

There is no pleading for mercy. Directing consequence to another. Offering rationalizations and hoping the verdict goes my way.

Potential outcomes down the dark path are unpredictable and undesirable.

Perhaps a rival takes revenge. Perhaps a fraud perpetrated years ago is uncovered. Secrets haunt you at night, disturbing your mind.

Emotionally, youâ€™re always waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I donâ€™t want that."<br>

<i>[12/29/2023, 3:04:14 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

Embracing the principles of Karma, the individual chose to shoulder complete responsibility for every event in their life.

This decision stemmed from a profound understanding that unwise actions, causing harm to others or engaging in wrongdoing, would inevitably rebound upon them.

The individual sought to avoid such repercussions altogether.

In this paradigm, there is no room for appeals for clemency, transferring consequences to someone else, or presenting justifications in the hope of a favorable judgment.

The potential outcomes that await those who venture down a morally questionable path are both unpredictable and undesirable.

There exists the possibility of retaliation from rivals, the revelation of long-buried past transgressions, and the tormenting presence of concealed secrets that disrupt one's peace of mind.

Emotionally, this approach leaves a person in a perpetual state of anxiety, always dreading the unknown consequences of their actions.

This is a situation the individual is determined to avoid at all costs.<br>
