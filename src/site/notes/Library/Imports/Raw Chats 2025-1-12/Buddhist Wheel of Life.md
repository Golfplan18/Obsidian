<i>[12/31/2023, 2:06:08 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: the buddhist wheel of life<br>
<i>[12/31/2023, 2:06:27 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The Buddhist Wheel of Life, also known as the Bhavachakra, is a symbolic representation of the cyclical nature of existence according to Buddhist philosophy. It's a complex image filled with various symbols and meanings. Here are its key elements:

1. **The Hub:** The center of the wheel contains three animals, typically a pig, a snake, and a rooster, representing the three poisons of ignorance, hatred, and desire.
2. **The Second Layer:** This layer is divided into two halves, one showing dark scenes representing bad destinies and the other light scenes depicting good destinies.
3. **The Six Realms:** Surrounding the hub are six segments representing the realms of existence - gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell beings.
4. **The Outer Rim:** This part consists of twelve sections, each illustrating a part of the Twelve Nidanas, which are the stages that explain the cycle of existence.
5. **The Holding Figure:** Often, the wheel is depicted as being held by a fearsome figure, symbolizing impermanence.

This image is rich in symbolism and each part offers deep insights into Buddhist teachings on karma, rebirth, and liberation.<br>
