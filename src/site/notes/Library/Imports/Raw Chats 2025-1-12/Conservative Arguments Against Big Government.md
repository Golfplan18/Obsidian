Conservative arguments against large government typically center on several key points:

1. **Personal Freedom and Responsibility**: Conservatives often argue that a large government can be overly intrusive in the lives of citizens, infringing on personal freedoms. They believe in individual responsibility and the idea that people should have the liberty to make their own choices without excessive government intervention.
2. **Economic Efficiency**: A common conservative viewpoint is that the private sector is more efficient at handling many functions than the government. They argue that a large government can lead to inefficiency, waste, and bureaucratic red tape, which can stifle innovation and economic growth.
3. **Taxation Concerns**: Conservatives typically advocate for lower taxes, arguing that a large government requires high taxes to support its activities. They believe that high taxes are a burden on individuals and businesses, potentially hindering economic growth and personal financial success.
4. **Limited Government Principle**: Many conservatives adhere to the principle of limited government, a key tenet of classical liberalism. This principle holds that the government's powers should be limited to essential functions, such as national defense and maintaining law and order, to prevent the abuse of power and protect civil liberties.
5. **Dependency and Welfare State**: There's a concern among conservatives that large government programs, especially welfare and social support systems, can create a dependency culture. They argue that this can disincentivize work and self-improvement, ultimately harming both individuals and the economy.
6. **Government Accountability**: Large governments, according to conservative views, can become too complex and opaque, leading to reduced accountability and increased opportunities for corruption and mismanagement.
7. **Impact on Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs**: Conservatives often argue that the regulations and compliance requirements that come with a large government disproportionately affect small businesses and entrepreneurs, hindering their ability to compete and innovate.

It's important to note that these arguments are generalizations and there is a diversity of thought within conservative circles. Additionally, perspectives on the role of government can vary depending on the specific political, economic, and social context.<br>

Conservative arguments against high taxes often revolve around several key points:

1. **Economic Growth**: Conservatives typically argue that high taxes can stifle economic growth. They believe that when individuals and businesses are taxed less, they have more capital to invest, spend, and create jobs, leading to a more robust and dynamic economy.
2. **Personal Freedom**: High taxes are seen as a restriction on personal freedom, as they reduce the amount of money individuals can spend, save, or invest as they choose. Conservatives often advocate for individuals having greater control over their own earnings.
3. **Government Efficiency**: There is a belief that governments are inherently less efficient in spending money than individuals or businesses. Therefore, conservatives argue that keeping more money in the hands of the private sector leads to more efficient and effective use of resources.
4. **Incentive to Work and Innovate**: High taxes can be seen as a disincentive to work harder, earn more, and innovate, as a significant portion of additional earnings is taken away. This perspective suggests that lower taxes can motivate individuals and businesses to strive for greater success.
5. **Size of Government**: High taxes are often associated with funding a larger government. Conservatives typically argue for a smaller government, focusing on essential functions and services, and believe that high taxes support unnecessary government expansion.
6. **Economic Competitiveness**: From a global perspective, conservatives argue that high tax rates can make a country less competitive. If businesses face lower taxes in other countries, they might relocate, leading to a loss of jobs and economic activity.
7. **Tax Burden on Middle and Lower Classes**: While the intention behind high taxes is often to target the wealthy, conservatives argue that the middle and lower classes can also be adversely affected, either directly through taxes or indirectly through the economic impact.
8. **Property Rights**: There is also a fundamental belief in the sanctity of property rights, and high taxes are seen as a violation of these rights by excessively redistributing income and wealth.

These arguments are grounded in a broader conservative philosophy that emphasizes smaller government, individual liberty, and free-market principles. However, it's important to note that there is a range of perspectives within conservatism, and not all conservatives may agree on each of these points.<br>

The text seems to outline a cynical view of the state as an instrument of aristocratic control. It presents the following points:

1. **State as Protector of Aristocracy**: The state is portrayed as necessary for maintaining the power and liberties of the aristocracy. It enforces property rights, national defense, and law and order, all while ensuring the suppression of workers' power.
2. **Draconian Laws for Workers**: Laws and law enforcement are described as harsh and authoritarian in their application to workers, while being non-restrictive to aristocrats, allowing them unfettered freedom.
3. **Small State to Limit Aristocratic Burden**: The state should be kept small to prevent the aristocracy from bearing its operational costs, and to avoid infringing upon aristocratic personal freedoms.
4. **Private Sector Efficiency**: Direct aristocratic control over the private sector is seen as more efficient than state-run services, with even monopolies being preferable to government provision of goods and services.
5. **Low Taxes for Aristocrats**: Taxes, especially inheritance taxes, are seen as detrimental to aristocratic wealth and should be minimized or eliminated to prevent strengthening the state against aristocratic interests.
6. **Welfare as a Threat to Aristocratic Control**: State welfare and social programs are criticized for creating a culture of dependency, which could empower individuals and workers to demand higher wages, seen as harmful to aristocratic interests.
7. **State Accountability to Aristocracy**: Large state programs are accused of reducing accountability and increasing corruption, which could hinder aristocrats' ability to exploit workers and resources.
8. **Aristocratic Control over Democracy**: The text argues that aristocrats must control the state while maintaining a façade of democracy, manipulating media and politics to ensure this control.
9. **Corruption of Political Parties**: The text suggests that aristocrats have control over the Republican Party and also support certain members of the Democratic Party to maintain their power.

The overall summary portrays a dystopian view where the state is manipulated to serve the interests of a powerful elite at the expense of the wider population and democratic principles.<br>
