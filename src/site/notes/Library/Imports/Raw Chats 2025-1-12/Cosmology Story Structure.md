Reflections on the outline for expanding awareness. By separating out criteria section from the explanation of the new cosmology from the analysis of how theology meets the criteria was very liberating. It allowed me to tell the cosmetology story standalone without all of these digressions back-and-forth to explain why the support with the implications are just becoming that end endless iterative cycle that would have made the story go so slow that it would not have been worth telling this opens the opportunity for telling a creation story with some emotional impact.

The last section was me dictating to a new inexpensive headpiece that I got and apparently either I speak unclearly, which can happen because I can go fast or this really isnâ€™t picking things up much better than the previous earbuds. I have. My guess is that since itâ€™s cheap and even though itâ€™s got this little thing getting the microphone closer to my mouth, itâ€™s not a full wraparound one where that microphone has placed just outside of that area where I would be expelling breath on it now Iâ€™ve got a big nice one like that at home, but apparently Iâ€™m gonna have to invest in a little bit of a nicer one for when I wanna get out and actually get some use out of it

The paper itself needs to be mostly formal and scientific, but I can interject imagery and other emotive elements as part of the creation story. The paper itself still needs to be appropriate to the audience, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the format is so rigid that I canâ€™t introduce elements to induce wonder, excitement and a sense of comfort with a new place in the world.

Also, the format allows me to have a conclusion and a rift part talking about how the implications of the cosmology go beyond explaining the physical observations from science, and then I can bring in all of the elements from the long written work, where I have the discussion about cognition, subjective experience, and putting people back at the center of our cosmology 

Religious fundamentalist in particular Christian just mentalists will not appreciate this particular aspect of the new cosmology. They want to cosmetology where God was at the center, and that we owe everything to God and this cosmetology is their ultimate nightmare that humans and humanism all of a sudden take control of the creation story 

I am concerned about it, backlash for my ideas and potential for personal physical danger from all of the people that are benefiting from the current status quo and in particular thatâ€™s gonna be western white evangelical Christians people who are part of the society that is ruthlessly exploiting human resources for its own good and setting up all kinds of structural and political institutions in order to try to institutionalize those advantages forever And if you can actually control the cosmetology which says that you deserve it and that somehow youâ€™re OK for acting in those ways well, it becomes a really handy support system for what I consider to be evil. There is going to be a lot of people that it will become a galvanized movement specifically in reaction against this because itâ€™s a change in perspective, they simply canâ€™t accept.

It reminds me of the Star Trek episode on first contact where the religious fundamentalist of the group is willing to shoot Ryker in order to keep the truth of his existence away from his people because he represents an end to that manâ€™s world view. When I first saw that show my first reaction was, why would anybody be so adamant that theyâ€™re willing to kill to sustain a lie that they even know is a lie but then again that has been a pattern throughout history, so it really shouldnâ€™t be that terribly surprising. There was an instance in Galileoâ€˜s age when he told a cardinal in the Catholic Church to look through the telescope for himself and see what Gaile seen And the man steadfastly refused to do so because he knew that the days through that telescope would be the end of his world view.
