<i>[12/16/2023, 9:03:19 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The case involving Salvador Sanchez, an off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer, and the shooting of Kenneth French at a Costco in Corona, California, began with a tragic incident on June 14, 2019. Kenneth French, a 32-year-old man with schizophrenia who was largely nonverbal, was at the Costco with his parents, Russell and Paola French. A brief confrontation occurred between French and Sanchez, who was also at the store with his 18-month-old son.

According to witness accounts and surveillance tapes, for reasons that remain unclear, Kenneth French shoved Sanchez to the ground. Sanchez, who was armed with an off-duty pistol, fired 10 shots, fatally wounding Kenneth French and seriously injuring his parents. It was noted that Kenneth was not armed, and his parents pleaded with Sanchez, informing him of their son's condition.

After the incident, the Riverside County District Attorney's Office presented the case to a grand jury, which declined to indict Sanchez. However, the California Department of Justice later filed charges against him. In 2020, the Los Angeles Police Commission determined that the shooting was an unjustifiable use of force, leading to Sanchez's dismissal from the LAPD.

The French family filed a lawsuit against the LAPD, the City of Los Angeles, and Sanchez, alleging negligence and civil rights violations. In November 2021, a jury awarded the French family $17 million in damages, finding that Sanchez had used excessive and unreasonable force.

Sanchez was charged with voluntary manslaughter and two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm resulting in great bodily injury. He was released on a $155,000 bond. Trial proceedings were scheduled but faced delays, with a tentative date set for the end of October 2023.

This case highlights the complexities surrounding the use of force by off-duty police officers, the challenges faced by individuals with mental disabilities in public settings, and the impact of such tragic events on all involved parties.<br>
