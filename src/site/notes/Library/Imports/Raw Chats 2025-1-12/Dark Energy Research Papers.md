Can you provide the research papers on Dark energy from these men:

Saul Perlmutter: Leading the Supernova Cosmology Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Perlmutter's team observed distant Type Ia supernovae to measure the universe's expansion rate. Their findings provided compelling evidence for the accelerating universe. 
Wikipedia
Brian P. Schmidt: As the head of the High-Z Supernova Search Team, Schmidt's group independently studied distant supernovae, arriving at conclusions consistent with an accelerating universe driven by dark energy. 
The Naked Scientists
Adam G. Riess: A key member of Schmidt's team, Riess played a pivotal role in analyzing supernova data that led to the discovery of the universe's accelerated expansion. He is currently a professor at Johns Hopkins University and continues to research dark energy and the universe's expansion rate.<br>

This is the current plan. What changes do you want to make?

Can you provide the research papers on Dark energy from these men?
(1) Find research papers on dark energy by Saul Perlmutter.
(2) Find research papers on dark energy by Brian P. Schmidt.
(3) Find research papers on dark energy by Adam G. Riess.
(4) For each of the men, find their most cited papers on dark energy.
(5) For each of the men, find their latest papers on dark energy.
(6) Find papers where all three men collaborated on dark energy research.

<i>[12/17/2024, 4:58:34 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

Unfortunately, you are correct. Many academic journals operate on a subscription basis, meaning that accessing the full text of research papers often requires payment. This can be a significant barrier to accessing information, especially for individuals without institutional affiliations or funding.

However, there are sometimes ways to access these papers for free:

* **Pre-print servers:** Many researchers make their papers available on pre-print servers like arXiv (pronounced "archive") [1] before formal publication. These versions might not be the final, peer-reviewed versions, but they often contain the core findings. You can find some of the papers mentioned in the report on arXiv, such as "The Hubble Tension and Early Dark Energy" by Riess and Kamionkowski [1].
* **Author websites:** Some researchers make their publications available on their personal or institutional websites. You can check the websites of Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess to see if they provide open access to their papers.
* **Open access journals:** A growing number of journals publish research with open access policies, making them freely available to the public. You can try searching for these papers in open access databases like the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).
* **Institutional repositories:** Universities and research institutions often have online repositories where their researchers deposit their work. You can try searching the repositories of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Australian National University, and Johns Hopkins University.

I'd be happy to help you locate specific papers on pre-print servers or author websites if you have any in mind. Just let me know the title or authors, and I'll do my best to find a publicly available version.<br>
