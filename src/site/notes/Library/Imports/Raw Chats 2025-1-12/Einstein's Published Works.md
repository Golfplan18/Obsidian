Chat GPT is stupid sometimes. Please follow this thread and provide me the list of books written by Albert Einstein including any books of his papers or collections of his works written by others. Any personal letters or correspondency by Einstein should be included regardless of the author. 

 "can you provide a list of published books by Albert Einstein?
