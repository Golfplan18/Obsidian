<i>[3/7/2024, 11:06:36 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: provide a definition of an emotional sense of entitlement<br>
<i>[3/7/2024, 11:06:55 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: An emotional sense of entitlement refers to a pervasive belief that one deserves more or is inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment, without regard to others' needs or efforts. This mindset is often characterized by unrealistic expectations for favorable treatment and an excessive focus on oneâ€™s own desires and rights, at the expense of consideration, empathy, and reciprocity towards others. Individuals with a strong sense of entitlement may exhibit frustration, anger, or disappointment when their expectations are not met, and they may struggle to acknowledge or appreciate the contributions and needs of others. This attitude can hinder personal relationships, professional environments, and personal growth, as it opposes the development of virtues like gratitude, compassion, and humility, which are essential for healthy, balanced emotional and spiritual development.<br>
