It’s unlikely my ex-wife will ever read this. She was never a fan of my writing. It wasn’t written for her, and I’m not planning to share it.

Because we share lifelong custody and care responsibility for our young adult son, we couldn’t sever ties and ghost each other. We can minimize contact, which we have since splitting in order to help start fresh, but we will have a relationship for the remainder of our lives. 

Going through this process, fueled by this writing, I feel a changed man.

In one of life’s many sad ironies, I will be a better man around her as an ex-husband than I ever was as her husband.

I’ve expressed my sincere apologies many times, and absorbed her blame, her anger, her resentments without resistance. Hopefully, it’s helping her heal too.

I wish for her to be happy and free from suffering, and the resentments she carries inside, the ones I created with my foolish behavior, those fires still burn, burning a hole in her heart. 

I have what’s left of my lifetime to make amends.”<br>

I write this not for her, nor for anyone’s eyes but my own. She wouldn’t read it even if I handed it to her directly. Words were never the bond between us—at least, not mine. She tolerated them, humored me maybe, but there was no love for them, no love in them that she wanted to see. And now, here I sit, etching out words she’ll never see, not because I want her to, but because I need to.

Our son ties us together. He’s grown, but still fragile, like a young sapling that won’t bear the storm if it hits too hard. We’ve learned how to keep a quiet distance, circling around him like shadows, crossing paths only when we have to, avoiding eye contact to keep wounds closed. It’s a delicate, bitter balance, the kind I never imagined would mark my days.

Yet, here’s the irony—the twist of fate, if there ever was one. I’ve become a better man in her absence, a better man as the ex-husband she tolerates, the stranger she nods to over a shared responsibility. Strange how loss can birth change, how empty spaces make room for growth. I was too foolish back then, too clouded to see clearly, to act rightly, to be the man I should have been for her.

I’ve apologized until my words fell silent in her ears, but I gave those apologies freely, for what they were worth, hoping they’d soothe at least one of the open wounds I left in her. She lashed out, and I absorbed it, let the storm rage through me without flinching, knowing I’d earned every word, every ounce of her anger. The flames of our resentment—my doing—still burn in her heart, scars I’ll carry in my own until my last breath.

But now, I wish her peace. I want her to wake in the morning without the weight of my mistakes pressing against her chest. I want her to live without the ache I left behind, without the anger that still simmers just below her surface. I want her to find the lightness I stole from her in all my blindness, my foolishness. And so, I go on, a quiet penance, knowing I can’t erase the past but hoping, in some way, I can make amends, even if it’s only in the silence I carry forward.<br>

She’ll never read this. It’s better that way. She’d roll her eyes at every line, thinking it just another excuse, another clumsy attempt to scrape off the past. She never took to my writing—never saw the words as anything but noise. And I can’t blame her for that. This wasn’t meant for her anyway. These words are the balm I need, not hers.

We’re bound together by our son. He’s grown enough to walk alone but fragile enough that we’re still tethered, orbiting around him, our paths crossing only when they have to. Since the split, we’ve held to that unspoken rule: keep it brief, keep it quiet, move on. But we both know that for his sake, for our own, our lives will touch, however faintly, for as long as we breathe.

And here’s the twist that chokes me up, the punchline life’s thrown my way. I’ve grown better in her absence, sharper, steadier—everything I should’ve been when we were together. I feel that bitter truth like a knife’s edge, knowing I failed her in ways I can’t reverse. As an ex-husband, I am more of a man than I ever was as her partner.

I’ve spoken my apologies more times than I can count, and each time I’ve stood there, arms at my sides, letting her fury wash over me. I’ve felt it burn through her words, through her silence, all of it deserved. The damage is mine to hold. The blame, the anger, the raw hurt—they’re the embers I left smoldering in her heart, wounds I carved with every mistake, every selfish misstep. Those fires, I know, they still burn.

But if there’s any justice, I wish her peace. I wish her mornings free of the weight I left on her heart, days where she isn’t shadowed by the pain I caused. If I could reach into her soul and calm the storms I left behind, I would. This, all of it, is my quiet penance—a lifetime spent in the faint hope that I can find some way to make it right, even if it’s only a sliver of redemption in the spaces between us.<br>
