Read the outline pasted below. We are going to start expanding the outline starting with section "### D. Statistical Correspondence
1. Born rule emergence
2. Uncertainty relations
3. Superposition states
4. Measurement process"

That will come in the next set of instructions. For now, absorb the outline and do nothing.

 I have carefully reviewed and absorbed the detailed outline for the paper "Classical Mechanics in Quantum Disguise: A Wobble Model Solution to Wave Function Collapse." I understand that we will be focusing on expanding section III.D "Statistical Correspondence" which covers:

1. Born rule emergence
2. Uncertainty relations  
3. Superposition states
4. Measurement process

The outline provides comprehensive context about how this section fits into the broader theoretical framework of the Wobble Model and its relationship to both classical and quantum mechanics. I'm ready to help expand this section while maintaining consistency with the paper's overall themes of:

- Reconciling classical determinism with quantum phenomena
- Providing a physical interpretation for quantum measurement
- Preserving local realism while explaining quantum correlations
- Building mathematical frameworks that bridge classical and quantum domains

I'll await your specific instructions for how you'd like to proceed with expanding section III.D.<br>

 I'll expand each point with an additional level of detail, maintaining consistency with the paper's theoretical framework while adding the next layer of structural organization:

### D. Statistical Correspondence

1. Born Rule Emergence
   a. Ensemble averaging of wobble trajectories
   b. Phase space distribution fundamentals
   c. Probability density derivation from classical dynamics
   d. Natural emergence of |ψ|² statistics
   e. Reconciliation with classical probability theory

2. Uncertainty Relations
   a. Intrinsic wobble amplitude constraints
   b. Phase-amplitude coupling mechanisms
   c. Complementary variable correlations
   d. Statistical bounds from classical trajectories
   e. Connection to measurement resolution limits

3. Superposition States
   a. Multiple trajectory coexistence
   b. Coherent phase relationships
   c. Interference pattern formation
   d. Path distinction effects
   e. Environmental interaction impact

4. Measurement Process
   a. Detector-system coupling dynamics
   b. Information extraction mechanisms
   c. Trajectory selection principles
   d. Apparent collapse phenomena
   e. Classical record formation

This expansion maintains the paper's focus on deriving quantum statistical properties from classical mechanical principles while providing clear paths for mathematical development and experimental verification. Each sublevel connects directly to the Wobble Model's foundational concepts while building toward the quantum-classical correspondence.

Would you like me to further expand any of these points or explain the rationale behind this organizational structure?<br>
