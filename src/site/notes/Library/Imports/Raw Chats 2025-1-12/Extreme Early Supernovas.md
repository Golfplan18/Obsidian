<i>[12/24/2024, 11:22:04 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>System</b>: Several studies have explored the connection between gravitational waves and early supernova explosions. For example, research published in 2023 discusses how gravitational waves can reveal the mechanisms behind core-collapse supernovae. Another study from 2018 examines how gravitational waves and neutrinos, emitted from deep inside a collapsing star, can provide direct insights into the explosion process. These studies aim to enhance our understanding of the early universe and the formation of heavy elements. ArXiv<br>
