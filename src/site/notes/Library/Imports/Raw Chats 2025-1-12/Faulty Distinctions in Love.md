‚ÄúA Faulty Distinction
The subtle distinctions we make in our minds are more powerful than we realize.
I knew there was a proper way to love, to accept someone unconditionally and not seek to change them. I applied this wisdom with my son, explored it, learned it, knew it in my experience, in my bones. 
I knew I wasn't applying that wisdom to my wife. Instead, I treated her like a male subordinate, someone to push to improve, seek his best self.
I knew this method of relating to men works very well. It even works for women in the workplace, with a more respectful and softer delivery. Those skills work out in the world.
I didn't make the distinction that accepting my wife completely, her feminine weaknesses and insecurities, neuroses, taking it all in and not wanting her to be any different was a better approach.
It seems so basic, I struggle to explain how a man can grow to his 50s and fail to figure this out.
I can blame feminism and the school system for making me feel that my maleness, my powerful mind fully powered and unleashed, my authentic self was faulty and needed to be retrained to think like in the feminine. But such blame accomplishes nothing. I was too arrogant to hear or understand the daily feedback my wife gave me. I wasn't being a real man. I was a weak fool defending my ego.
It was the analogy of the hawk and the dove that made me see the fundamental distinction that I had missed. The need for complete acceptance and protection is woven into the relationship power imbalance created by dominant physical strength. I could see that with my son. I didn't see that with my wife.
I was pretty stupid.‚Äù<br>

**Paraphrased Narrative**  
*A Faulty Distinction*  

The distinctions we draw in our minds hold more weight than we imagine.  

I once believed I knew how to love properly‚Äîto accept someone without condition, without trying to reshape them. With my son, I lived this truth. I learned it through him, carried it in my marrow. But with my wife, I failed.  

I treated her as though she were a subordinate, a man I could nudge, challenge, shape into something better. This approach worked with men, even with women in professional spaces, softened by respect and gentler language. But at home, it fell apart.  

I never understood the deeper need‚Äîto embrace her entirely. Her fragilities, fears, quirks, all of it. I never grasped that seeking to change her wasn't love, but control. That realization, painfully simple, came too late.  

How does a man reach fifty and miss something so essential? I could blame feminism, education systems that told me my masculinity was flawed, my mind too sharp and untamed. But blame solves nothing. I ignored her daily feedback, her quiet calls for a man who would protect and accept her without critique. I thought I was strong; I was a fool defending my fragile pride.  

The hawk and dove analogy finally opened my eyes. Strength, by its nature, creates an imbalance. My son showed me how protection and unconditional love could coexist. I failed to apply it where it mattered most.  

I was blind, arrogant‚Äîstupid.

‚ÄúPart 4: The Weight of Reflection

Confronting the Ruins

In the quiet aftermath of our marriage, I sat with the wreckage of everything we had built. The silence surrounded me, broken only by the whispers of my thoughts. At first, I wanted to blame her‚Äîfor giving up, for retreating into fear while I stood there, exposed. But the longer I carried the weight of what had happened, the clearer it became: the fault was mine.‚Äù

text at the target:

"This was the hardest series of truths to document. I had to let go of the victim‚Äôs mask, the illusion that I‚Äôd done nothing wrong, that she was fully to blame for the breakup because she was crazy. I had to emotionally ‚Äúown‚Äù my failures and face each one unflinching. 

When I finally looked at us from a different perspective, seeing the roles of masculinity and femininity in a real marriage, my mistakes hit me like a hammer‚Äîso obvious, so shameful, it bludgeoned my defenses, crushing my resistance.

I realized I had been a fool, arrogant and blind. I ignored her reactions and reduced her attraction for me down to nothing, even less than nothing. She struggled alone, stuck and floundering, while I mocked her for it. Teased her weaknesses.

How could I have been so foolish? In case you missed them‚Ä¶

When I read through the first draft of this work, I saw everything anew‚Äîfor the first time from her side, with fresh understanding. I stopped to meditate on how my behavior impacted her, dropping all my internal rationalizations and justifications for anything I did.

I imagined her future from her point of view. What lay in store for her if she stayed with me, absent any real change?

More of the same.

My failures, though numerous and obvious now, were distorted by pride and arrogance. My certainty in the wrong concepts magnified my ignorance.

She would endure years of her femininity being blasted with the masculine energy she‚Äôs supposed to be protected from. She wasn‚Äôt being accepted, the fundamental nature of love, denied to her.

I wasn‚Äôt loving her properly, worse than not loving her. Who would want more of that?

I played the song Easy On Me by Adele.

    There ain't no gold in this river
    That I've been washin' my hands in forever
    I know there is hope in these waters
    But I can't bring myself to swim
    When I am drowning in this silence
    Baby, let me in

    Go easy on me, baby

    There ain't no room for things to change
    When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
    You can't deny how hard I've tried
    I changed who I was to put you both first
    But now I give up

    Go easy on me, baby

    Easy on Me ‚Äî Adele

When I heard my ex-wife‚Äôs feelings come through Adele‚Äôs voice, frustration, despair, begging for mercy, submitting, feminine, hoping against hope that I might find the courage for one last masculine act‚Äîallow her to leave in peace. Ease her transition.

I saw the situation from her point of view, my heart broke open, compassion overwhelmed me. 

Masculine energy upwelled, the desire to protect her from the brute who was hurting her‚Äîexcept that I was that brute. The scope and scale of my failure blasted right back at me, a perfect mirror into her pain.

I felt the painful and hopeless state I induced, the enormous relief to be released from that.

I wept. I sobbed, diving over and over into the ocean of pain, sadness, disappointment I inflicted upon her. I anguished with the despair we share over the wasted effort we invested in ourselves as a couple, ultimately amounting to nothing.

And I grieved for the deep, heart-wrenching sadness we both felt when we realized that even if we succeeded in staying together, there was no reward for our troubles.

She had suffered through a man who refused to be truly masculine, a man who laughed at her weaknesses instead of lifting her up.

She‚Äôd endured wild highs and lows, all because she had the misfortune of choosing me, believing me when I said I would love her. Little did she know that I didn‚Äôt know how to love, not in actions anyway, the only measure that matters.

I let the sobbing run its course, listening to that song repeatedly over many days, reminding myself of my many mistakes.

    I've been tryin' to get down
    To the heart of the matter
    But my will gets weak
    And my thoughts seem to scatter
    But I think it's about
    Forgiveness, forgiveness
    Even if, even if
    You don't love me anymore

    Heart of the Matter‚ÄîDon Henley

When I first opened my heart to her pain, I felt lower than low. But each session was cleansing, healing, a painful but necessary part of the process.

Tears wash away the stains of the heart.
Remorse is How We Take Responsibility

I took responsibility, not just for the facts, but for her pain, wishing I‚Äôd known then what I know now. 

I felt remorse, also known as healthy regret, a feeling I covet. This was a hard-earned regret I wanted to keep close, a reminder of mistakes I‚Äôd never want to repeat.

I dropped the self-loathing and aimed that raw energy at the beliefs that led me to fail her and to act so poorly.

Regret is my guardrail, the feeling that would pull me back if I ever leaned toward those same mistakes.

Finding that regret, feeling it fully, and rolling remorse into my heart was a milestone in my healing. Facing my flaws was the emotional reward, leaving me stronger and wiser.

‚ÄúLessons in Strength and Compassion

Through the ashes of my marriage, I unearthed a profound truth: masculinity isn‚Äôt about dominance or the fa√ßade of strength. It‚Äôs a quiet force, steady and unshakable, rooted in purpose and care. My failures revealed what I misunderstood about being a man and what I needed to change.

I found guidance in the analogy of the hawk and the dove. A true man embodies the hawk‚Äôs strength‚Äînot to control, but to protect. He creates a space where the dove, the feminine essence, can soar freely. This balance isn‚Äôt restrictive; it‚Äôs harmonious. Each thrives in their strengths, complementing rather than competing.

True masculinity isn‚Äôt mere confidence or assertiveness‚Äîit‚Äôs clarity of purpose. It‚Äôs moving with intention, mastering oneself before influencing others. Masculinity isn‚Äôt found in power over others; it‚Äôs rooted in discipline, self-control, and a life driven by meaningful pursuits.

This transformation reshaped my relationships and my sense of self. I stopped seeking validation from others. My actions became deliberate, my decisions grounded. I no longer softened my edges to meet expectations or bent to avoid conflict. I began proving myself to me.

But reclaiming strength wasn‚Äôt enough‚Äîit had to be wielded responsibly. Misused masculinity becomes cruelty. Driven by fear or arrogance, it crushes rather than uplifts. A gentleman doesn‚Äôt compete with the feminine; he complements it. He leads with empathy, listens with humility, and offers strength without imposing control."

This is the text in the target location:

"Being my Best Self

I focus on being my best self, refining the basics.

I pay attention to every detail in my dress and care for the sharpness in my appearance.

I push harder in my workouts, lifting with more purpose, and making each session count.

I build friendships and connect with others in my community.

I live a life with intention, one that a feminine woman would want to step into, drawn by the strength and steadiness in the foundation I lay.

I‚Äôm finding myself again, reclaiming what it means to be a man. I saw the problem clearly for the first time; I needed to change. 

My identity is defined by my actions, by pursuing what drives me, keeping my word to live morally and ethically, giving something back to the community around me.

I‚Äôm defining what masculine behavior means to me. My incomplete list includes the following: 

    cultivating strength of heart, the courage to love, the resilience to recover from disappointment,

    understanding and adapting to the needs of the feminine, always viewing disagreements through her feminine frame,

    view the feminine as a helpless dove, protected from masculine resistance, especially my own,

    improving self-discipline, the command and control over my body, my mind, and my choices, 

    the determination and courage to make decisions and stand firm behind them, and

    the thrill of a life lived with passion. 

I‚Äôm learning what it means to be the kind of man a woman would want at her side‚Äînot through new tricks, but by unlearning the false beliefs and habits that had dimmed my spark.

Now, I‚Äôm honest about who I am and what I expect. I make my choices freely, defend them with steady resolve, and feel no shame for what I think, say, and do.

My freedom is mine, and I intend to live it fully, with passion.

    What does it take to be a man?

    The will to give and not receive
    The strength to say what you believe
    The heart to feel what others feel inside
    To see what they can see

    A man is somethin' that's real
    It's not what you are
    It's what you can feel
    It can't be too late
    To look through the hate and see
    I know that's what a man can be

    Be a Man‚ÄîBoston 

I‚Äôm building a foundation that won‚Äôt bend. I‚Äôve always been sensitive, maybe too empathic‚Äîa softness that leaned toward the feminine. I let others‚Äô beliefs slip into my own when I was younger, even when they clashed with what I felt was right. It was a weakness, a lack of confidence, allowing another‚Äôs view to replace my own. 

I also wasted energy on my own illusions, tainted by pride and arrogance. I was lost in beliefs that didn‚Äôt serve me.

But a wise man sees through these deceptions, his own and those of others. He grounds himself in what‚Äôs real, refusing to be swayed or reshaped by outside voices, even in conflict, especially in conflict.

That‚Äôs the worldview I‚Äôm forging‚Äîa life built on solid ground, untouched by the shifting world around it.
Compassion Reigns Supreme

I‚Äôm going deeper into my spiritual practice, but this time, I‚Äôm shaping it to strengthen who I am.

Before, it softened me and brought out the gentler, more feminine traits, and that was my mistake, not the practice itself. I‚Äôd let the teachings take a form that dulled my edge, not embracing them properly.

Now, I see it differently. My practice is a well of strength, a source of courage and resilience‚Äîthe marks of a firm, masculine man.

Compassion is the feeling of sadness for the suffering of another, coupled with the desire to relieve their pain. False bravado degrades this as bleeding heart nonsense, a weakness to be avoided.

In truth, feeling deeply the sadness of others takes tremendous strength of heart, the height of masculine power.

Compassion is masculine.

Compassion is the wellspring of Passion, the force of life.

I‚Äôm learning to weave these traits into my life, letting my heart guide me, but with the resolve of a steady hand and a clear mind."<br>

‚ÄúPenance to the Ex-Wife

Burning the sorrow so deeply into my heart had side effects. At the deepest of the sobbing, the determination arose to make amends, manifesting in two desires: cleanse her heart, provide her lifelong security.

Now, I allow her to vent her rage, never defending, absorbing her truth, her pain. It‚Äôs a slow process; I inflicted a deep wound with much residual pain. It will take as long as it takes.

I‚Äôm her social security. If all else fails, I‚Äôll ensure she is taken care of. Even if we severed contact for many years, that obligation is buried deep, certain to arise.

She may ghost me to the degree she can, denying me an opportunity for redemption. She may find another man to provide her care.

I‚Äôll do whatever is reasonable and appropriate to comfort her.

Penance, the road to redemption, has no final destination, no resolution, no release.

I don‚Äôt foresee ever feeling that I did enough. ‚Äù<br>

The sorrow carved itself into me, leaving a mark I couldn‚Äôt erase. In the depths of my grief, determination took root‚Äîa need to make amends. Two purposes burned clear: to soothe her heart and secure her future.  

I let her rage spill out, offering no defense, absorbing her truth and pain. The wound I caused runs deep, with pain that lingers. I don‚Äôt rush the process; it will take what time it needs.  

If all else fails, I am her safety net. Even if years pass in silence, I will ensure her security. That promise stays buried within me, ready to rise when needed.  

She may vanish from my life, denying me the chance for redemption, or find another man to protect her. Still, I will offer comfort where I can, within reason.  

Penance isn‚Äôt a journey with an end. No redemption, no absolution waits at the finish.  

I doubt I‚Äôll ever feel I‚Äôve done enough.
