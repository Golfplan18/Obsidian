<i>[12/19/2024, 5:31:31 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: when was gravitational lensing first identified and documented<br>

Gravitational lensing was first identified and documented in **1919** during a famous astronomical expedition led by **Arthur Eddington**. The phenomenon was observed during a **total solar eclipse** on May 29, 1919. 

Eddington and his team measured the apparent shift in the positions of stars near the Sun, consistent with the bending of light predicted by **Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity** (published in 1915). This was one of the first major experimental confirmations of Einstein's theory. 

Although the concept of gravitational lensing was hinted at earlier by Einstein in **1915**, and he refined the idea further in **1936**, it was the 1919 eclipse observations that provided direct, documented evidence.<br>

<i>[12/19/2024, 7:47:17 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

**Refraction** is the bending of light (or any wave) as it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index. This bending occurs because the speed of light changes depending on the density of the medium it is traveling through.

### Key Points of Refraction:

1. **Change in Speed**:
   - When light enters a denser medium (e.g., air to water), it slows down and bends toward the normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface at the point of entry).
   - When light enters a less dense medium (e.g., water to air), it speeds up and bends away from the normal.

2. **Snell's Law**:
   Refraction is governed by **Snell's Law**:
   \[
   n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
   \]
   Where:
   - \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the refractive indices of the two media.
   - \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are the angles of incidence and refraction, measured from the normal.

3. **Refractive Index**:
   The refractive index (\( n \)) is a measure of how much a medium slows down light compared to its speed in a vacuum. For example:
   - Air has \( n \approx 1 \)
   - Water has \( n \approx 1.33 \)
   - Glass has \( n \approx 1.5 \)

4. **Examples of Refraction**:
   - **Prisms**: Light entering and exiting a prism bends at each boundary, separating white light into its constituent colors (dispersion).
   - **Lenses**: Refraction allows lenses to focus or spread light, which is fundamental in eyeglasses, cameras, and telescopes.
   - **Mirages**: Changes in air density due to temperature gradients cause light to refract, creating optical illusions like mirages.

5. **Critical Angle and Total Internal Reflection**:
   If light tries to move from a denser to a less dense medium at a steep angle, it can be completely reflected back into the denser medium. This phenomenon is called **total internal reflection**, and it forms the basis for fiber optics.

In essence, refraction is the result of light's changing speed as it transitions between different media, a principle that underlies many natural and technological phenomena.<br>
