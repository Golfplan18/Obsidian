<i>[2/18/2024, 4:10:50 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: A moral compass is a figurative term used to describe a person's ability to judge what is right and wrong and act accordingly. It's like an internal guide that helps individuals decide how to behave in different situations, based on their understanding of ethics and morality. The concept of a moral compass is influenced by various factors, including upbringing, culture, religion, personal beliefs, and societal norms. It plays a crucial role in guiding a person's decisions and actions, helping them to live in a way that is consistent with their values and principles.<br>
