meta description "The first kiss in a budding romance.

As a young heir to a huge family fortune, my parents and the trustees wanted to ensure I was up to the task of managing so much money. In order to start taking over for my father, I needed to complete a graduate level course of study in negotiation and finance.

I was also impatient, so I didn’t intend to go to college, party, waste time, and start work in my mid-twenties. When I was still a teenager, I completed advanced coursework at the college level by hiring the best tutors to come to my estate and teach me one-on-one.

I was all business until I hired Angelica Bentley, a beautiful prodigy in negotiation and finance whom my father admired and recommended to me. I watched her recorded lectures, and I found her intelligence challenging and her beauty distracting.

I found myself fantasizing about a relationship with her, which shocked me.

I had plenty of options—perhaps too many. I dated Miss Teen Sweden until she leaked photos of us together to the paparazzi. I found the immaturity of young women offputting.

I could date any woman I wanted, so I didn’t fully understand why I wanted a woman in her early 30s, more than a decade older than me.

Perhaps I wanted the challenge.

This captivating college professor had been on my mind for weeks, and when she arrived at my estate, and I met her in person, I was smitten. I didn’t know how I would concentrate on her instruction.

I asked my estate manager Sage to befriend her and meet her needs while Angelica visited. Sage was a close friend of my mother’s, a sister in her sorority.

Sage was a bit of a spy for my parents, but I agreed to her presence on the estate to placate my parents’ concerns that I might have trashed the place with too many wild parties. Since my parents gave me the largest of our beachfront properties, it didn’t seem like an unreasonable request or one that I could easily refuse.

First class

I got up early for the first tutoring session and tried to meditate. I failed. I was distracted by the salacious fantasies of Angelica. Every position, every kink, I imagined it all—repeatedly. Visions of her drove me crazy.

I went to my home gym to burn off energy, but lifting weights flooded me with testosterone, so I had to relieve myself in the shower. I was afraid a raging hard-on would distract me from my studies.

Angelica distracted me anyway.

The study in the main estate house was large and rectangular, with panoramic ocean views out of walls of glass. The study was filled with a 12-man conference table, a fireplace, side seating areas, and a large-screen television.

I set up a lectern in front of the fireplace for Angelica to stand behind. I wanted to sit below her to be respectful, but I knew I would admire her long legs as well.

When Angelica entered the room, I stood and said, “I had my staff set up your lecture materials. Did they do it properly?”

As Angelica reviewed the materials, I poured two glasses of water and brought one over to Angelica.

“This setup is fine. I think we’re ready to start,” Angelica says, “And thank you for the water.”

I settled into my chair and locked my gaze on her beautiful eyes.

She continued, “I want to start by establishing some rules and guidelines for facilitating the instruction.”

“First, the day is broken down into four sessions approximately ninety minutes long. Each session will have forty minutes of instruction, twenty minutes of question and answer, and thirty minutes for breaks or extended discussion. We will have two morning sessions and two afternoon sessions with an hour for lunch. We should conclude at around 4:00 each day.”

“Second, I like participation, and you can ask questions at any time, but I may opt to defer answering until the concept is fully explained.”

“Third, since concepts build on each other, we will continue with each lesson until you demonstrate sufficient understanding to move to the next lesson. Do you agree with these rules?” 

“Yes, Ms. Bentley,” I said rather formally, thinking that Sage must have put her up to that speech.

But I also noted that Angelica’s power really turned me on. I perceived a strong, confident woman, powerful in her domain, someone with strength. I admired that and hoped she would live up to that assessment.

I’m accustomed to power. My family is wealthy, and my parents wield tremendous power as mega-donors to political candidates. They have formidable personalities. They also taught me the value of restraint.

“Perfect,” she said, “Let’s begin.” 

Angelica provided a full outline of the course over the forty minutes. I tried to pay careful attention to her lecture, but her legs were so lovely, that I kept imagining burying my face between them.

When she concluded, I asked her several questions and suggested a break to relax and prepare for the next session. I needed to compose myself too. I wished I had time for another shower.

Passing grade

After the break, I stood at the lectern, and I reached out and gently took her right hand to get her undivided attention.

I said, “You impress me with your command of the subject matter and your skills as a lecturer. I want you to continue as my instructor, and I promise to do my best not to fail you as a student." 

I continued standing there, holding her hand, looking into her eyes, waiting for a response.

She seemed startled by my statement, or maybe she was surprised that I took her hand.

Perhaps she didn’t realize her teaching position was not assured, and she had, in fact, just earned the right to teach me. Perhaps my subservient demeanor caused her to forget the power I command.

She appeared to fumble for her next words.

“Thank you," she says, to acknowledge the compliment. “What would you have done if I had not impressed you?"

I smiled at her, released her hand, and sat back in my seat beneath her.

I said, “If I were unconvinced of your abilities, or if I had concerns about your ability to teach me, I would have instructed my staff to pay your fee, escort you back to the airport, and contact the next candidate.”

“To be kind, I would have politely thanked you for making the journey and apologized for deciding to go a different direction with my education.”

Perhaps I was too honest and blunt. I paused because it looked like she took offense. I certainly didn’t want to upset her.

I went on, “In truth, I consider the fee we negotiated an appearance fee. If I pass my exams due to your instruction, you will earn a large bonus."

I thought the potential rewards would calm her fears. She appeared gobsmacked by my candor and honesty. I surmised she didn’t fully appreciate that I was the one in charge of my estate, my education, and my life.

Angelica said, somewhat defiantly, “I would have gladly taught you for the fee alone." 

Her defensive reaction told me that I had blown it, and I needed to reassure her to recover.

I replied, “I know. I also know that you drove the hardest bargain with the trustees over the fee, which actually served to impress me with your application, given that negotiation is what you are here to teach me. But I am not overly focused on the cost of my education.”

“I am far more concerned with the value you provide, and I believe you deliver value.”

I saw her relax a bit. I paused to collect my thoughts, “Let me explain further. When you sent over the course materials, I read all three textbooks, and I also read all your published academic work."

“That's a couple of thousands of pages of heavy reading!” Angelica said, apparently impressed. I was feeling relief that I didn’t ruin the opportunity.

“I can't pretend that I understand it all. That’s why I need your instruction to help me absorb it. I have plenty of time for study here, so I immersed myself in the subject over the last two weeks, which I hope makes your job easier."

“I wish every student was as motivated as you. I'm lucky if most of them bother showing up for class," Angelica joked.

I was elated that I saved the situation. I giggled at her joke and continued, “I wanted to share that with you to demonstrate my seriousness to learn, and I also want you to believe that my compliment on your knowledge and ability was based on more than just your overview lecture.”

“My apologies if my assessment seems blunt, but I’ve researched you thoroughly. No matter how good my information, I felt I needed to meet you to confirm my assessment was accurate.”

Angelica smiled broadly, but she seemed unnerved by the conversation. I sat down in my chair and looked up at her as subserviently as I could, hoping to put her fears to rest.

As she started back into her lecture, I had trouble focusing. I found her beauty mesmerizing. I wanted to make a naked human pretzel, wrapping my arms around her while she wrapped her legs around me.

I realized I probably came across as overbearing and domineering, and I didn’t want her to fear me.

When you grow up wealthy and powerful, you don’t feel the need to project that power in every situation—that’s a nouveau riche failing.

It also occurred to me that if I did try to seduce her, she might feel uncomfortable, as if romance was part of the deal. I didn’t want to make her feel like a call girl or accuse me of harassment.

My dick, my heart, and my mind were not together on this one. My cock wanted her—that was certain. My heart was unsure, and my mind was telling me not to be stupid.

I was a mess.

I could only imagine what she was thinking, probably that I was an immature jerk.

I didn’t think she even found me attractive.

Lunch Invitation

After forty-five minutes of instruction and discussion on the key points of the first lecture, we took a break. I approached the lectern to talk to Angelica face-to-face, attempting to mask my nervousness.

“My staff will prepare lunch. If you want time alone to prepare for the afternoon session, you can dine privately in your quarters or on the dining patio. The views there are tremendous. Sage or others on the staff would be happy to chat with you if you would like the company of others." I said.

I looked down, and I noticed my trembling hand reaching out for hers. It was as if my hand had a mind of its own.

As my fingers wrapped around and reached her palm, I noticed she didn’t resist, so I gathered my courage and looked up into her eyes.

After a pause, I stammered a bit, but I finally said, “I would be delighted if you would have lunch with me." My heart was aflutter with anxiety about her saying no, though I tried to look confident. I feared I looked like a little boy.

To my surprise and delight, she replied, “I would love to have lunch with you."

I tried to contain my excitement and relief, but I couldn’t.

“Great!” I said. And I wondered why she said “love” to eat lunch with me. Was she telegraphing interest? I was afraid that an embarrassing boyish look had returned.

I wanted to appear strong and manly, so I pulled her right hand up to my mouth, kissed it softly, and said, “Thank you, I look forward to it.”

She quickly changed the subject.

“If you don't mind sharing, I would be interested to know more about your family history and how they became so successful. Your forefathers must have been master negotiators.”

I released her hand quickly in case I misread the situation.

“I can tell you anything you want to know,” I said. “I recently completed my history and political science studies and learned more about the background of their exploits.”

I worried that kissing her hand might have been too much, but she seemed to enjoy the gesture.

She was difficult for me to read. Either she was good at hiding her feelings, or I was poor at reading through my own.

Lunchtime

When we stepped into the dining hall, the trays were placed on the nearby console table per my instructions to the staff.

Angelica said, “I appreciate that you go out of your way to personally serve me. Last night when we had the welcome dinner, I expected an impressive show of servants, but when you served me instead, I was pleasantly surprised. And now you are doing it again. Thank you.”

“My parents taught me the value of service, but, realistically, with so many servants at the estate, I don’t practice it very often. I’m glad you appreciate it.”

After we ate and chatted, Angelica asked me again about how my family acquired so much wealth.

I told her the unvarnished truth, “Let me start the story in 1980 when Ronald Reagan was elected President. The collapse of organized labor and the takeover by monopolies allowed the wealthy to usurp the value labor produced to increase their own wealth more quickly.”

“My grandfather was already wealthy, but not stand-out wealthy. He owned a few companies that provided good cash returns, so he had money to invest. He was a gifted securities trader who made a large windfall in the dotcom bubble, which enabled him to acquire this property, among others.”

“He and other wealthy power brokers like the Koch brothers set out to capture the levers of government with their political donations so that they could secure tax breaks to keep their wealth in perpetuity.”

“In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled money was free speech, and they took over the media. Manipulation of public opinion became the norm, and later tax law changes and court rulings, plus gutting the IRS, allowed multi-generational wealth to be passed on without inheritance taxes.”

“My parents were both from wealthy families, and their marriage made our family trust one of the larger ones. With no check on growth, these fortunes have become enormous while the standard of living of workers falls to subsistence levels. The rich really do get richer.”

“To be honest, I think the system kind of sucks, particularly for workers, but I have only three options: one, I could walk away from the money entirely, perhaps becoming an ordinary worker; two, I could live out my life with unlimited spending money, focused on recreation or some other frivolous pursuit I may fancy; or three, I could qualify myself to manage the endowment and at least try to steer the funds toward investments I consider worthy.

Unfortunately, the trust overseers wouldn’t allow me to give it away or donate it all to charities. Some family trustees have tried, and the overseers ousted them as managers. These trusts have become entities of their own, designed to consume the world.”

Angelica said, “It sounds like these trusts have become the plant from the Little Shop of Horrors, a monster out of control, even consuming the people who created it.”

I said, “The Buddhists describe an entity they call a hungry ghost. It’s a creature with a huge stomach, a long slender neck, and a tiny pinhole mouth. Even if the mouth is fed constantly, the food causes pain squeezing down the neck to a cavernous stomach that can never be filled. These trusts are the modern manifestation of a hungry ghost.”

She said, “It sounds like you are torn between your desire to manage the trust and doing what you feel is right, as if the two are incompatible.”

I said, “I am conflicted on this. Quite honestly, though I am working diligently toward passing my exams and qualifying to manage the endowment, I haven’t decided which of the three options I will choose.”

She asked, “Would you really walk away from it all?”

I replied, “This fortune is both a blessing and a curse. Power, if used rightly, is a blessing, but when you become attached to that power, it becomes a curse.”

“I am attached to it. Right now, I couldn’t just walk away and live as a monk in a monastery or go live as a common worker struggling to make ends meet. I am powerless in the face of my own attachments.”

“My only solace is the idea that I could manage the endowment as a force for good, but I may just be fooling myself with that rationalization for my attachment. It’s a difficult emotional dilemma, and I don’t see how to resolve it.”

She said, “Your insight into your own feelings on this speak well of you. In the fullness of time, I believe you will make the decision that is best for you and for others. You’re wise to prepare to take over the endowment to give yourself that option. You could always decide not to go that route later.”

She seemed to have a genuine concern for my well-being. It opened my heart.

I said, “That’s what keeps me going toward completing my certification. Realistically, I won’t need to make a final decision for several years because my father will continue managing the endowment until he’s ready to step back, and he thinks I am fully prepared to take over. I will serve on the investment committee as an advisor until it’s my time.”

“Thanks for sharing your story. I feel like I understand you and your motivation for success. I will do my best to help you pass your exams,” she said

The kiss

Angelica asked, “Are you ready for the next lesson?”

“Yes, I’m ready,” I said.

I stood up and reached out to help her, and she took my hand and rose to face me. When she stood up, she was uncomfortably close to me, but neither of us stepped back.

There was a pregnant pause.

If I had tried to kiss her, and she rejected me, I would have been crushed, and the remainder of our tutoring sessions would be uncomfortable. Realistically, I would have paid her to leave.

If I did kiss her, and she had kissed me out of fear, then I would be using my power to coerce her, which would have tainted everything, making it unreal.

I knew I needed to make a decision, right then and there, but I was petrified.

I couldn’t read her. Why was she still so close to me? Did she want me to kiss her?

As I gazed into her eyes, a small smile betrayed her feelings, and she inched slightly closer to me. The smile seemed like more than friendly approval.

That ghostly hand with a mind of its own started moving again. I reached up and touched her cheek and neck to see if she pulled away. My other hand entwined my fingers with hers.

I pulled her gently toward me, slowly and carefully, until our bodies touched.

I leaned over and touched my lips to her lips, kissing her softly, reveling in the velvety softness of her lips, savoring the moment.

She pressed her lips against mine, making it clear this was something she wanted, too.

I had no idea what I was getting into, but I felt the plane lift off, and I left behind my drab life of endless study and focus on the future.

I wanted to live in that moment forever.

Whatever thrills awaited, I intended to discover them with her.

I could barely contain my excitement, and my hardened cock strained in my pants. I wondered if those pleasures were on the tutoring agenda for later.

But like all experiences, this one had to end eventually, and after a few intimate moments, I pulled back and looked into her eyes.

She reflected back an approving smile.

My pulse raced, my mind was aflutter, and I was overcome with excitement and joy.

I tried to be cool and debonair, but my facade was transparent. She wanted me, and I found that fact absolutely thrilling!

I wasn’t sure why. I didn’t know if she wanted companionship, sex, love, money, excitement, or some combination of all of them, but the kiss signified a willingness to explore, to take a chance, to roll the dice and see what happens.

I wanted a relationship with an emotionally mature woman, a woman who might grow to love me if my character made me worthy. I was Perceval on a quest for love’s Holy Grail, a Chivalrous Knight proving my honor.

I was young and foolish, but I was okay with that. Whatever happened next, I would be wiser and more experienced.

I had no real reason to resist, so I didn’t.

I lunged in and gave her another quick kiss, gazed into her eyes with a beaming smile, and then pretended as if nothing happened.

I said, “What is the topic of this afternoon's lesson, Ms. Bentley?"

Lovingly lustful,
