provide a meta summary and keyword list for seo "Reincarnation is Useful Bullshit

Do I actually believe, as ontological Body reality, that I have actually existed through endless lifetimes?

No. I don’t.

But I don’t need to.

I don’t need to believe in magnetism to use a compass.

Karma still works when I act as if I’ve lived an infinite number of lifetimes, and more importantly, I have a great many more lives yet to go.

Belief in rebirth is not essential to Buddhist practice; however, you need to think and act as if you will take a rebirth based on your actions in this life.

Is there a difference? 

I believe so. I can suspend my disbelief and enjoy a movie or written fiction. Why should it be any more difficult to suspend disbelief in rebirth to obtain the benefits of spiritual practice?

What is the value of belief in rebirth? It opens the door to understanding and living my Karma.

Karma is the belief that our actions have consequences. Often the connection is apparent and obvious, but sometimes it’s not.

When there is a delay between the action and the consequence, we don’t always recognize the connection.

When we employ selective memory or willful ignorance, we can pretend the connection doesn’t exist at all. This is particularly useful if we want to do something bad in hopes we can dodge the consequences.

And what about those circumstances when something bad happens that doesn’t appear to have any connection to past actions? 

When something bad happens to me that doesn’t appear to be in any way connected to anything I’ve ever done in my life, my first reaction is, “Why me God?”

That question opens a doorway to suffering.

Enter Karma.

Karma

Whenever something happens I didn’t want or foresee, I still feel an initial burst of anger.

How dare Fate, Karma, God, (insert anyone other than me) make this awful thing happen?

Am I a victim?

After giggling at my foolishness momentarily, a nanosecond later, I cut it off by reminding myself that whatever occurs, it happens because of actions I took in the past, even if it was lifetimes ago.

If I accept that whatever happened was due to something I did wrong in a previous life, it has two positive effects.

First, it cuts off the “why me” victim nonsense that makes me feel terrible.

Second, it makes me even more confident that my actions have consequences, which is what I want.

Third, and most importantly, when I consider my future lives, I know that anything I do will come back on me at some point, even if it takes thousands of lifetimes.

There is no escape from responsibility.

Moral Compass

People hurt each other for selfish reasons because they believe they can get away with it.

If my actions have no consequences, I would pretty much do what I want.

Most religions and cultures invent a Hell as a catch-all insurance policy against getting-away-with-it while you are alive, hoping perhaps this will motivate a few people to “be good” to avoid eternal damnation.

As a concept, it’s become so burdened by legalese, pointless debates on dogma, and philosophical mental masturbation that it no longer has enough emotional impact to scare people straight, assuming it ever did.

Karma is the shackle of personal responsibility every ego wants to avoid.

Yet, it must be chosen.

People have been imposing their Gods on each other since antiquity, forcing them to see the Light by using Dark, usually extinguishing the flames of heathens and heretics if they refused to accept someone else’s Salvation.

It was never about them, the people supposedly being Saved.

Buddhism is different: It’s a path of choice.

You either choose to feel Karma’s navigating field or you don’t.

Here’s how it works.

If I truly believed my actions were absolutely going to come back to me in some form or fashion, and there was no escape, none, no dodging responsibility — when I felt that hit my heart — I didn’t want to inflict my selfish desires on anyone.

The Power of Karma is its ability to prevent me from hurting others.

I use it as a mind hack.

A useful tool to drive my motivation toward virtue.

When you learn to navigate by it Karma is an excellent moral compass, a needle aligning your heart True North, pointing you down the Proper Path.

100% Responsible

Once I started navigating by Karma, I took 100% responsibility for everything that occurred to me.

Why? Because if I act unwisely, hurt people, or do bad things, it will come back to hurt me.

I don’t want that.

There is no pleading for mercy. Directing consequence to another. Offering rationalizations and hoping the verdict goes my way.

Potential outcomes down the dark path are unpredictable and undesirable.

Perhaps a rival takes revenge. Perhaps a fraud perpetrated years ago is uncovered. Secrets haunt you at night, disturbing your mind.

Emotionally, you’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I don’t want that.

Regret: What Responsibility Feels Like

Live-with-no-regrets is the anthem of Desire. It’s not wise spiritual advice.

A life without regrets represents a failure to learn from mistakes.

For many years, I continually inflicted subtle emotional pain on my life partner.

I didn’t feel that pain because I didn’t consider her experience, and I likely would have convinced myself I wasn’t responsible for her reaction.

I felt no regret.

When I looked honestly at the behavior, an unpleasant feeling of revulsion arose.

The deeper I dug, the more intense I felt that pain.

Most people recoil when they feel the unpleasant feelings of remorse.

I use it as a warning sign.

It’s telling me that I am considering a behavior that has caused others pain in the past.

If I continue down this path, I am likely to do something that will make me feel that pain with more intensity.

Don’t do it.

Just say no.

~~wink~~

paraphrase the following "Buddhism instructs us to look at these tendencies and natural reactions, evaluate the suffering they create, and apply our wisdom to make wiser choices that reduce our sufferings and those of other people.

The Buddha taught that we should cultivate equanimity, regard ourselves as having no value, and treat all others with equally high regard, the opposite of our natural inclinations.

Equanimity refers to a balanced and impartial attitude toward all sentient beings, free from attachment, aversion, or indifference.

Developing Equanimity
Equanimity starts with recognizing that all sentient beings, without exception, are fundamentally equal in their desire for happiness and avoidance of suffering. This includes friends, enemies, and strangers, as well as all living beings in various realms of existence.

Lamrim's teachings emphasize the need to overcome attachment to friends and loved ones and aversion toward enemies or those we perceive as harmful. Attachment and aversion are obstacles to genuine equanimity."<br>

<i>[2/19/2024, 3:03:19 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Buddhism guides us to examine our natural behaviors and responses, assess the pain they cause, and use our insight to choose more wisely, lessening our own suffering and that of others.

The Buddha's teachings highlight the importance of developing equanimity, encouraging us to see ourselves as valueless and to treat everyone else with the same high level of respect, challenging our innate tendencies.

Equanimity is about maintaining a calm and fair stance towards all beings, avoiding biases, dislikes, or apathy.

Cultivating Equanimity
The journey to equanimity begins with the acknowledgment that every sentient being shares an equal wish to be happy and to steer clear of pain. This understanding applies universally, from our closest associates to our adversaries, and extends to all creatures across different planes of existence.

The Lamrim teachings stress the importance of moving past our fondness for friends and family and our hostility towards foes or those we find disagreeable. Such feelings of attachment and aversion stand in the way of true equanimity.<br>

paraphrase the following "It’s a foundational meditation, as most of the subsequent meditations build on the realizations and feelings generated by thinking about the love of your mother.

Lamrim is the stages on the path to enlightenment. No advanced Buddhist practitioner maintains animus toward their mother.

Any practitioner who has mommy issues overcomes them because it’s essential to moving forward on the journey.

This isn’t only true for Buddhists. "<br>

<i>[2/19/2024, 3:12:51 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

This meditation serves as a cornerstone, with many subsequent meditations relying on the insights and emotions stirred by contemplating your mother's love.

Lamrim outlines the progressive steps towards enlightenment. A seasoned Buddhist practitioner harbors no resentment towards their mother.

A practitioner facing issues related to their mother resolves these conflicts as overcoming them is crucial for progression on the spiritual path.

This principle isn't exclusive to Buddhism.<br>

<i>[2/19/2024, 3:15:08 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: 

paraphrase the following "When your mother realized she was pregnant with you, she could have evicted you at the cost of your life.

Laws on the matter notwithstanding, aborting fetuses has been a practice since antiquity, and your mother could have aborted you.

You were a guest that she allowed to stay in her own body, despite the pains and the problems a developing baby entails.

If she had made a different choice, you would not be reading these words now.

That isn’t conjecture; it’s a fact.

If you were homeless and destitute and someone invited you into their home and provided you with food and shelter, you would consider that person kind and generous.

Your mother is due the same consideration.

Absent your victim story, you would feel the need to express gratitude for your very existence.

When you were in your mother’s womb, she protected you more carefully than a precious jewel. In every situation, she thought about your safety.

She consulted doctors, exercised, at special foods, and nurtured you for nine months.

She was careful not to do anything that would have damaged the development of your physical and mental faculties.

And even if she fell short in some regard, she made sure you survived.
"<br>

<i>[2/19/2024, 3:15:24 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Upon discovering her pregnancy, your mother faced the option of terminating it, potentially ending your life.

Regardless of the legalities, the practice of terminating pregnancies dates back to ancient times, and your mother chose not to take that path with you.

You were essentially a tenant in her body, a presence she welcomed despite the discomfort and challenges that come with pregnancy.

Had she decided otherwise, you wouldn't be here to read this message.

This is not speculation; it's a reality.

Imagine being without a home and in dire need, and someone offers you their home, food, and care. You'd view them as compassionate and generous.

Your mother deserves the same recognition.

Without dwelling on any perceived grievances, you'd naturally feel compelled to appreciate your existence.

While you were in her womb, she guarded you as if you were a priceless treasure, always prioritizing your well-being.

She sought medical advice, maintained her health, ate nutritious foods, and took care of you for nine months, ensuring nothing she did would harm your physical or mental development.

Even if she wasn't perfect in every way, her efforts ensured your survival.<br>
