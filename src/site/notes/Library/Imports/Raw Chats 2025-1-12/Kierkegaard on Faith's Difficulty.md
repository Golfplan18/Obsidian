SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher, theologian, and writer, had profound insights on religion and its complexities. His approach to Christianity was notably unconventional for his time. Kierkegaard believed that true religiousness was a deeply personal and subjective experience. He was critical of the established Church and its practices, arguing that they made Christianity too easy and convenient, thus losing the essence of faith.

For Kierkegaard, true faith was not about comfortably fitting into societal norms or religious institutions. Instead, it was about the individual's passionate and personal relationship with God, often marked by struggle, doubt, and existential angst. He introduced the concept of the "leap of faith," which is the idea that embracing faith involves a personal leap into the unknown, beyond the reach of rationality and empirical evidence.

Kierkegaard's view made religion 'difficult' because it demanded a complete and personal engagement with faith, rather than a passive acceptance of institutionalized beliefs. He emphasized the individual's subjective experience of God and the importance of personal responsibility in the face of life's existential questions. This approach was revolutionary and remains influential in contemporary theology and existential philosophy.<br>
