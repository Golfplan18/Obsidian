The Initial Scope, Intermediate Scope, and Great Scope of Lamrim

When people are very young, they learn to crawl; later, they learn to walk; finally, they learn to run. Each skill builds on the previous one. 

Similarly, the scopes of Tibetan Buddhist Lamrim, Initial, Intermediate, and Great, build upon each other. 

Lamrim is the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment. There are no viable shortcuts, and the path itself has side roads to explore, depending on the practitionerâ€™s past Karma and emotional issues they must resolve.

Someone could study a meditation handbook and attempt to master the advanced meditations of the Great Scope, but the likelihood of success is very low.

The Tibetan Buddhist Lamrim teachings on the initial scope focus on the foundational stages of spiritual practice and emphasize the desire to achieve a favorable rebirth and avoid the suffering of lower realms. 

While the emphasis in the initial scope is on ethical conduct and virtuous actions, practitioners may also engage in basic meditation practices to develop concentration and mindfulness, which are foundational practices in subsequent stages.

In the intermediate scope, the future Buddha cultivates moral discipline, accumulates merit, and acquires sublime wisdom. In the great scope, the person actualizes perfect Buddhahood.  

Recognizing the Preciousness of Human Life

The initial scope begins with recognizing the rarity and value of human life, especially one that is conducive to spiritual practice. 

In ancient times, most people spent the majority of their time working to meet basic survival needs. Few people had the opportunity to explore spiritual matters.

While modern life may seem hectic, compared to the ancients, we have abundant time for spiritual practice.

The initial scope stresses that human life provides a unique opportunity for spiritual growth and should not be wasted.

Cultivating the Mindfulness of Death

Contemplating the impermanence of life and the inevitability of death is a powerful source of motivation. When one deeply internalizes the reality of death, it leads to a deeper appreciation of one's precious human life and motivates people not to waste it.

When people reflect on the fact that death could happen at any moment, they prioritize important matters, like engaging in spiritual practice, to prepare for the inevitable.

Practicing mindfulness of death and impermanence in daily life helps individuals make conscious choices, rather than instinctively pursuing earthly pleasures, attainments, fame, or objects of desire.

Feeling the Appropriate Fear of Lower Rebirth

Practitioners are encouraged to contemplate the suffering in the lower realms of existence, such as the hell realms, hungry ghost realms, and animal realms. This contemplation fosters a healthy fear of lower rebirths and motivates individuals to avoid negative actions that could lead to such rebirths.

The primary goal in the initial scope is to secure a favorable rebirth, such as a human life or a life in the heavenly realms, where there are better conditions for practicing Dharma (spiritual path). This desire for a better rebirth serves as a foundation for further spiritual progress.

Taking Refuge in the Three Jewels 

Practitioners are guided to take refuge in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) as a source of protection and guidance on their spiritual journey. Taking refuge serves as a source of strength, inspiration, and instruction.

Understanding Ethical Conduct and the Law of Karma

Lamrim's teachings stress the importance of ethical conduct as a means to create positive karma and secure a favorable rebirth. Practitioners are encouraged to observe ethical principles, refrain from harming others, and engage in virtuous actions.

Generosity is a key practice in the initial scope, as it creates positive karma and leads to better circumstances in future lives. Giving to those in need and supporting spiritual causes are seen as virtuous acts.

The motivation for ethical behavior comes from an understanding of Karma, the observation that our actions have consequences.

In summary, the Tibetan Buddhist Lamrim teachings on the initial scope focus on recognizing the preciousness of human life, understanding the suffering in samsara, and aspiring for a favorable rebirth through ethical conduct and virtuous actions. 

These teachings provide a foundational framework for individuals to begin their spiritual journey and gradually progress on the path to enlightenment.
