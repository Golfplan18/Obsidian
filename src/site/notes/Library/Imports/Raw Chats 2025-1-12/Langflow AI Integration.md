<i>[1/3/2025, 5:17:37 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>System</b>: Langflow is a low-code platform that allows you to build AI agents using various models and APIs, including Claude AI, ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini. To integrate these models, you can use Langflow's visual interface to create workflows that connect to their respective APIs. For example, to use Claude AI, you would register for the Anthropic API console, obtain an API key, and then configure Langflow to interact with Claude's API. Similarly, for ChatGPT, you would use OpenAI's API, and for Gemini, you would use Google's API. Langflow's documentation provides detailed guides on setting up these integrations. AI Rockstars<br>
