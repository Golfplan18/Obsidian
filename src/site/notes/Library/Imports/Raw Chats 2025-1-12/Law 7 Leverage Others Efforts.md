Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own muse. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.

"Get Others to Do the Work for You, But Always Take the Credit" is one of the 48 laws of power, as outlined in Robert Greene's book "The 48 Laws of Power." This law, like others in the book, provides guidance on how to attain and maintain power, often through manipulative or morally questionable means. 

Law Overview:

The law states that you should use the skills, talents, and labor of other people to further your own agenda. The ultimate goal is to receive credit for these efforts, enhancing your reputation and influence while conserving your own energy and resources, ideally doing nothing at all.

Strategies and Techniques:

Utilize Experts: Find skilled individuals who can complete tasks efficiently and effectively. Utilize their expertise to accomplish tasks that contribute to your objectives.

Remain in the Background: While others are doing the work, itâ€™s important to stay in the shadows, only stepping forward to claim credit when the time is right.

Control the Narrative: Make sure that those in influential positions see you as the architect of the success. This may involve strategically positioning yourself as the key decision-maker or the creative mind behind the project.

Manage Contributions: While you should acknowledge the efforts of others when absolutely necessary, the law advises minimizing the perceived contribution of others in comparison to your own.

Take Ownership of Success: When a project succeeds, be the first to present it, frame it, and take ownership. This ensures that in the public eye, success is primarily associated with you.

Potential Risks:

Backlash from Peers: If others feel exploited or sense that they are not receiving due credit, it can lead to resentment, backlash, or even sabotage.

Reputation Damage: If discovered, this strategy can severely damage your reputation, painting you as manipulative and untrustworthy.

Dependence on Others: Over-reliance on others can leave you vulnerable if key contributors withdraw their support or leave.

Ethical Considerations: This approach raises serious ethical questions and can conflict with values of fairness, honesty, and integrity.

In contemporary corporate and political environments, this law can be observed in practice. Leaders often take credit for the successes of their teams or departments, using these achievements to bolster their own status and power within the organization.
