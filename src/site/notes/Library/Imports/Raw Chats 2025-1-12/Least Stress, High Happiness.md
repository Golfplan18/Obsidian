<i>[2/20/2024, 11:25:54 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: which countries have the least stress and highest levels of happiness<br>
<i>[2/20/2024, 11:26:22 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

Countries with the least stress and highest levels of happiness are often ranked in various surveys and reports based on factors like economic stability, social support, income levels, freedom to make life choices, generosity, health, and environmental quality. The World Happiness Report, an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, typically provides such rankings.

As of my last update in April 2023, the countries that consistently rank high in happiness and presumably lower in stress levels include:

1. **Finland** - Often ranked at the top due to its high levels of social support, trust in government, and personal freedom.
2. **Denmark** - Known for its strong sense of community, low levels of corruption, and high standard of living.
3. **Switzerland** - Scores high in health, economic stability, and community support.
4. **Iceland** - Has a strong social network and a high sense of community, even in remote areas.
5. **Netherlands** - Features a good balance between work and life, high levels of personal freedom, and supportive social networks.
6. **Norway** - Known for its high income levels, social security, and environmental quality.
7. **Sweden** - Scores well in terms of public services, environmental quality, and social support.
8. **Luxembourg** - Offers a high standard of living, strong social security, and a stable economy.
9. **New Zealand** - Praised for its sense of community, environmental beauty, and relatively low levels of stress.
10. **Austria** - Features high levels of well-being, good healthcare, and environmental quality.

These rankings can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific criteria used for measurement. Happiness and stress levels are influenced by a wide range of factors, including personal circumstances and cultural perspectives on what constitutes happiness and stress.<br>
