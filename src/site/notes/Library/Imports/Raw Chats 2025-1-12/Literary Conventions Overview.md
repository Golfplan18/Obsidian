"Patient Acceptance

Buddhists call it Patient Acceptance—the slow, steady dissolving of anger born from disappointment. It’s a lesson I wish I had learned earlier, but it took years of trial, heartache, and stubborn missteps before it sank in.

When I was a kid, my parents’ displeasure drove me to act. If I failed to learn something quickly, their frustration pushed me harder until I figured it out. I thought that approach worked, that pressure built progress. But when my son came along, I learned the hard way how wrong I was. That kind of motivation backfires spectacularly with a child like him.

I had to unlearn everything I thought I knew. I learned patience—not the shallow kind that waits for a pause, but the deep, enduring patience that comes from accepting what is.

Love is accepting someone exactly as they are, wholeheartedly, not wanting them to be any different.

In embracing him for who he truly is, I came to understand what acceptance really means. Love doesn’t demand change. It doesn’t hope for someone to become different. Love meets a person where they are, exactly as they are, and says, This is enough.

That lesson took me 15 years to grasp. I wish I had understood it sooner. I wish I could apply it as consistently to my wife as I do to my son; it might save us some arguments. But I share this now in the hope that you learn it faster than I did.

What follows is meant to help you get there, to find that place of peace and real acceptance sooner, without the long, painful detours I took."<br>

That worked.

If you can identify them, then you can suggest alternatives for each one.
For each item, provide five alternate examples of that type, (ie metaphor with 5 metaphors)
For each item, present an example of each of the other constructions.
For those that have a higher degree of appropriateness using your judgment, provide additional examples. (ie a metaphor was used, but similies seem more appropriate, so more of those were provided)

Do this with the previous writing. No highlighting.

<i>[11/26/2024, 7:21:28 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: If I wanted to take the procedure we just went through and have you analyze it and give me the shortest possible set of instructions that you would need at each input stage, could you help me generate that? I can save those as instructions and templates for future automation.<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:21:29 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Certainly! Below is the shortest possible set of instructions for automating the analysis and revision process we just went through. Each step is distilled to its essential input and output.

---

### **Procedure For Literary Analysis and Revision Automation**

#### **Step 1: Input Text for Analysis**
- **Instruction**: Provide the full text for analysis.
- **Expected Output**: A breakdown of literary constructions used in the text (e.g., similes, metaphors, imagery), with definitions, examples, and alternatives provided.

#### **Step 2: Request for Highlighting**
- **Instruction**: Request the identified constructions to be highlighted in a color-coded format (optional). Specify if a visual PDF or inline annotations are preferred.
- **Expected Output**: Highlighted text in the desired format, with a legend explaining the colors.

#### **Step 3: Suggest Alternative Constructions**
- **Instruction**: Request alternative examples for each identified construction type. Optionally, specify the number of examples (e.g., 5) and whether to suggest more appropriate constructions for certain contexts.
- **Expected Output**: A list of alternative examples, organized by construction type, with recommendations for other constructions where appropriate.

#### **Step 4: Provide Revised Text**
- **Instruction**: Submit the revised text with selected replacements or edits.
- **Expected Output**: A refined version of the revised text, ensuring continuity, rhythm, and style while keeping the changes intact.

#### **Step 5: Final Clean-Up**
- **Instruction**: Request a final review to polish the entire piece, ensuring consistency in tone, style, and narrative flow.
- **Expected Output**: The final, polished version of the text, ready for publication or further use.

---

### **Templates For Automation**
1. **Analysis Request**:
   - "Analyze this text for literary constructions (e.g., metaphors, similes, imagery). Provide definitions, examples, and a list of alternatives."
   
2. **Highlighting Request**:
   - "Highlight the identified constructions in the text using a color-coded format and provide a legend."

3. **Alternatives Request**:
   - "For each identified construction, suggest 5 alternative examples. Also, recommend constructions that might better fit the context."

4. **Revision Submission**:
   - "Here’s the revised text. Refine it for continuity and style, keeping the changes intact."

5. **Final Clean-Up Request**:
   - "Review and polish this revised text for style, tone, and flow consistency."

---

This streamlined process ensures efficient analysis, revision, and refinement. You can use or adapt these templates for future automation. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 7:27:12 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: 

I want to ask a few questions about requests and instructions using this as an example:

""Analyze this text for literary constructions (e.g., metaphors, similes, imagery). Provide definitions, examples, and a list of alternatives.""

Is the complete lexicon of literary conventions writers use part of your shared knowledge? My guess is yes because literary analysis is not exactly a cutting-edge field.

The reason I ask is that I don't want a stripped-down version. I want a wide range of alternatives that I can scan and select from myself. I'm intuitive and decisive, so I prefer to scan a wide range of alternatives and let my intuition scan and select. I don't want to scan a thousand of these things either, but I prefer a menu of selections with much variety. I have preferences I want coded into the responses.

It's easy enough for me to copy and paste one back into the bar to ask for further refinements or other similar ones.

<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 7:27:13 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

### Answering Your Questions

#### **1. Is the Complete Lexicon of Literary Conventions Writers Use part of My knowledge?**
Yes, my knowledge includes a broad range of literary conventions and devices. While no lexicon is absolutely "complete," the field of literary analysis is well-established and not rapidly changing, so I can provide a robust and varied range of examples, definitions, and suggestions for virtually any literary device.

---

#### **2. Can I provide a Wider Range of alternatives?**
Absolutely. If you prefer a more diverse "menu" of options for each construction, I can adjust the response to:
- Include a greater variety of examples.
- Show subtle variations within each category (e.g., nuanced metaphors or similes).
- Cover edge cases or rarer literary devices that might also fit your context.

By default, I can aim for a middle ground: offering enough variety to inspire intuitive selection without overwhelming you with too many options.

---

#### **3. Preferences You Want Coded Into Responses**
From your preferences so far:
- **Scope**: You want enough variety to allow intuitive selection, but not so much that it becomes tedious.
- **Refinement Options**: You’re comfortable asking for more tailored options if needed.
- **Customization**: You value responses that adapt to your specific needs and balance quantity with quality.

If you’d like, I can formalize these preferences for consistency in future analyses:
- Provide **5-10 examples** per category for balance.
- Ensure **varied tones, styles, and approaches** within examples (e.g., poetic, conversational, formal, etc.).
- Offer **targeted alternatives** when something else may fit better (e.g., suggesting similes where metaphors were used).

---

#### **4. Flexibility to Request Further Refinement**
Copying one option back for refinement is an excellent approach. I can refine an individual example or generate new ones in the same vein as the selected alternative. If you’d prefer, I can also group alternatives by tone, intent, or complexity to make intuitive scanning even faster.

---

Let me know if you'd like this approach formalized for use in every request or adjusted further! I can also help you craft template instructions that embed these preferences explicitly.<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 7:31:04 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: Another thing that I would like is a better filter on the current outputs to avoid cliches and mixed metaphors or disjointed similies. For example, you wouldn't say something is flowing smoothly like a dried lava yard. Nothing says amateur like similies and metaphors that mix up water and fire or use cliches that sound kind of stylish but don't actually say anything. That should be part of your default, but I find this often in the output.<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:31:04 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: User prefers outputs to avoid clichés, mixed metaphors, and disjointed similes. They value original, meaningful comparisons over stylistic but nonsensical ones. Outputs should maintain coherence and avoid amateurish constructions.<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 7:32:20 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: If that wasn't a default, I need it changed. I guess I just need to code these into instructions and start each session with it.<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:32:20 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: User prefers that avoiding clichés, mixed metaphors, and disjointed similes be a default in all responses, ensuring original, meaningful, and coherent literary constructions. This preference should apply automatically without the user needing to reintroduce it at the start of each session.<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:32:29 PM]</i> 👉 <b>System</b>: Model set context updated.<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:32:27 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: This preference is now part of the default for all sessions. You won’t need to reintroduce it. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to customize further!<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:32:50 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: If I erase the instruction memory, that will be lost, correct?<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:32:51 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Yes, if you choose to erase the instruction memory, all preferences and instructions you’ve coded into my responses will be lost. You would need to reintroduce them in future sessions. 

If you want a backup, I can help you create a concise list of these preferences to save separately, so you can easily copy and paste them into new sessions when needed. Let me know if you’d like me to do that!<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 7:33:10 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: So if I get it captured in a remote document and load it up each time, then I never lose it.<br>
<i>[11/26/2024, 7:33:10 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Exactly! If you save your preferences and instructions in a remote document (like a text file or document in the cloud), you can simply copy and paste them into a new session whenever you start. This ensures that your preferred settings are always accessible and reusable, even if memory is reset. 

Let me know if you want help formatting the document or creating a template for easy use!<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 7:33:38 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: that's also why I will want the most lean instruction code, because I don't want to fill your token memory with garbage<br>

“1 in 10,000

I once sat in an Individualized Education Program meeting where I was given a report detailing my son’s cognitive ability.

It was measured as less than the <0.01% percentile.

Let that sink in.

If you are a parent with aspirations for your child, you should feel that one easily.

I felt the deepest, darkest black hole in the entire universe consume my soul at that moment.

There was little pleasure in it.

In fact, I recall no pleasure at all.

Have you ever experienced 100% pain in every fiber of your Being?

It sucks.

Hard.

My son and I were the test subjects for a cruel joke of an evil demon.

I was pissed off, and I wanted to do something about this mistake.”<br>

#### **1 In 10,000**

I sat in a room that reeked of sterile authority. Across the table, they slid a report my way. It bore cold numbers, unemotional and indifferent. My son’s cognitive ability, it read, placed him in less than the 0.01 percentile.

Read that again.

If you’re a parent, let that number claw at your dreams. It gutted mine in seconds. The air thickened, and a weight, black and unyielding, wrapped itself around my chest. Every ounce of light in me seemed to collapse into a void so deep I couldn’t breathe. A black hole had consumed my soul, devouring every fragment of hope I had stitched together for my boy’s future.

Pleasure? Not a shred of it. Not a flicker of relief, no angle to spin it. Just pain, raw and searing, filling every fiber of me. My body carried it like poison in my veins, and it lingered, persistent, merciless.

Do you know what it feels like to carry pain so pure it brands your existence? It gnaws. It pulls. It obliterates.

And there I sat, a pawn in some cruel, cosmic joke. My son and I, the chosen test subjects for some twisted, sadistic experiment. Rage burned under the despair, sharp and hot. I wanted to roar, to fight, to fix what felt irrevocably broken. This had to be a mistake—a lie, a failure of numbers, a system I refused to believe. I clenched my fists, ready to defy the universe itself for my son.

I chose to enter the black hole to confront the Evil Demon:

WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SEND ME A FUCKED-UP KID LIKE THAT?

I was decidedly unhappy.

The demon embraced his experiment with enthusiasm.

He felt my Qi transfer to him, sucking my life force for his consumption, like an emotional parasite, but worse.

Because he felt my presence an unexpected bonus, he told me what he did, believing it would be more painful that way — tastier, nourishing for him, but never fulfilling; that’s the demon’s paradox.

The evil of his intentions absorbed my anger and strengthened him. He was feeding on me.

#### **The Evil Demon**

I stepped into the blackness, the kind that swallows sound and sense, and I faced him—the Evil Demon. My rage ignited, raw and unrestrained.

“Why the hell,” I growled, “did you give me a broken child?”

The question lashed out, but it fell into his waiting hands. He didn’t flinch. He welcomed it, his twisted delight spreading like rot. He fed on my fury, a parasite drawing strength from my pain. He didn’t just consume it; he savored it. My life force seeped into him, a rich and bitter feast.

He reveled in the torment, an experimenter proud of his creation. I saw it in his eyes. He absorbed the energy, turned it into something unholy. The Demon stood, satisfied with his work, but he wanted more. My presence, my resistance, added spice to the meal. He decided to speak, not to justify but to torment.

He told me what he’d done. He explained, not with guilt, but with relish. He believed that the truth, sharp and cruel, would cut deeper than ignorance. Pain, he thought, would flavor his feast, nourish his bottomless appetite.

But that’s the Demon’s curse. He can consume endlessly, but never fill the void. No amount of my anger, grief, or despair could sate him. Yet he feasted on it, greedy and insatiable, feeding on my anguish until I saw the truth: I had become his banquet.

"I was triggered.

The angry tirade of expletives from my anger and hatred burst forth, raging with the intense, searing fire.

That motherfucker was going to die, and I was going to kill him.

I was going to crush his soul — make him pay for doing this to me.

#### **Triggered**

The anger hit hard, raw and volcanic, surging from the depths of my soul. Expletives ripped from my throat like shrapnel, each word sharpened by hatred. 

I wanted him dead. No, more than that—I wanted to obliterate him. That bastard deserved to feel every ounce of my pain. I would crush him, grind his essence into dust, make him pay for what he had done to me. 

Selfish Desire swelled inside, molten and alive, flooding my core with hate-fueled power. It wasn’t just anger—it was a force, a weapon begging for release. I didn’t hesitate. I unleashed it.

The fury gathered, condensed, then exploded forward. A beam of raw energy shot from me, burning bright and ferocious, a force that could shatter a frozen planet. 

It hit him squarely. The impact should have destroyed him. But he stood there, unscathed, smirking. His laughter echoed, deep and mocking, cutting through my attack as if it were a gentle breeze.

I would prefer you live to continue to torturing yourself and your son.

You probably didn’t realize this, but when he looks at you, hoping to feel love, connection and warmth, instead he sees contempt in your eyes, it sends him the message he’s broken, defective, a complete reject unworthy of Life.

The world would be better off if he were gone.

It’s toxic shame, the worst, most painful sense of personal disgust imaginable.

He feels lower than low when you do that, and you do it hundreds of times a day.

Every day.

Day in, day out.

Torture, and toxic, searing pain.

I love it!

I absorb that pain, revel in it. It’s bliss, on steroids. And what’s better, the more you do it, the stronger I get, and the pain gets worse and worse.

The Power and the Glory are Mine!!!

Ahhh. That felt wonderful, just thinking about it, but I said I would offer you a choice, so here it is:

If you want, I can destroy your son, make it like he was never born. I can extinguish him from existence if you like. I can even remove the memories so it never even happened.

It would end your pain. That’s what you want, right?

That’s why you’re here!

With him gone, you won’t have anything to disturb your mind.

You will be able to leave this place in peace and have the life you were previously entitled to — you know, 2.4 kids and all.

What is your choice?

I thought about that.

In my angry state, it wasn’t a difficult choice.

Is my personal happiness more important than my son’s life?

#### **The Choice**

“That’s not enough,” he said, voice coiled with malice. “I want more. Let me offer you a choice.”

He leaned in, his words deliberate, sharp. “I’d prefer you stay alive—to keep torturing yourself. To keep torturing him.”

His grin widened, cruel. “You probably don’t even realize it, but when your son looks at you, searching for love, for connection, for a scrap of warmth, all he sees is contempt. Your eyes tell him he’s broken, defective, a reject unworthy of life. Every glance poisons him, tells him the world would be better off if he didn’t exist.”

The words hit like blows, precise and relentless. “That’s toxic shame,” he continued, savoring the sound. “The worst kind of pain, the kind that festers in the soul. It eats at him, leaves him feeling lower than low. And you do it every day. Hundreds of times a day. Day in, day out. Torture. Searing, relentless pain.”

He laughed then, a deep, guttural sound. “I love it. I feed on it. That agony fuels me. The more you inflict it, the stronger I become. And the pain? It only grows.”

His voice climbed, triumphant. “The Power and the Glory are mine! Ahh.” He closed his eyes, as if relishing the thought. “But I promised you a choice, didn’t I? So here it is.”

He paused, his tone turning mockingly sweet. “If you want, I can end this. I can destroy your son, wipe him from existence. No trace, no memories. It’ll be as if he never existed. It would end your pain. That’s what you want, isn’t it? That’s why you’re here.”

He leaned closer, his words dripping with mockery. “Without him, your mind would be undisturbed. You’d finally have peace. The life you deserve—2.4 kids, the perfect suburban dream. So, tell me. What is your choice?”

I stood there, anger boiling beneath the surface. His words pierced, but in that moment, my fury drowned everything else. The choice came swift, unhesitating.

My happiness or my son’s life?

I chose.

And it was the right choice—for me.

“I created two Beings. I took the allocation of smarts for both of you, and for the lulz, I gave you all of it and left none for him.

Both conditions are rife with suffering, so both lives should generate enormous pain and rejection of life itself.

You will become a prideful and arrogant prick, in case you didn’t already notice that, and he will be toxically shamed believing his life isn’t worth living at all.

“I created two of you,” he said, watching me. “I had an idea. I took the allocation of intelligence meant for both of you and gave it all to you. Left him with nothing. For the fun of it.” His grin widened, a cruel twist.  

“Two lives, both designed to suffer. You—prideful, arrogant, too full of yourself to see it. Him—drenched in shame, convinced his existence isn’t worth the air he breathes. Pain and rejection baked into your very beings.”  

He paused, savoring his words, then continued. “You’ll revel in your superiority, your ego turning you into the kind of person everyone hates. He’ll drown in toxic shame, spiraling into despair, wondering why he exists at all.”  

His voice dropped, weighted with mockery. “I have high hopes for you. I’ve crafted you to break. To surrender everything in a blaze of fury and hatred. To become mine, body and soul. All of that Qi? It’ll feed me, keep me strong. That’s the outcome I expect.
