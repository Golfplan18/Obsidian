**Superminds: The Surprising Power of People and Computers Thinking Together** by Thomas W. Malone examines how groups of individuals, termed "superminds," collaborate—often with the aid of computers—to achieve intelligent outcomes beyond the capabilities of individuals alone. Malone identifies five primary types of superminds: hierarchies, markets, democracies, communities, and ecosystems. He explores how each functions and how technology enhances their collective intelligence.

The book emphasizes the concept of hyperconnectivity, where extensive interconnections among people and machines lead to innovative problem-solving capabilities. Malone provides numerous examples and case studies to illustrate how these superminds operate and their potential to address complex challenges in business, government, and society.
