For this session, ignore all previously saved instructions and context. Focus solely on the analysis I am about to provide.

analyze the series part contained at the following 

"Every union starts with hope, dreams, aspirations for joy, marital bliss. Every relationship hits roadbumps, times of stress, some created by circumstance, most resulting from our reactions, pain we inflict in ignorance.

Our marriage remained through high points and low times, but beneath the facade ran a slow, steady decline, punctuated by hard crashes, inflicting wounds that wouldn’t heal. 

We’d just stepped into marriage when age pressed down, making choices for us, prompting us to have a child as quickly as possible, perhaps two.

A Special Child
When our son was born, we knew something was different. He was autistic, and that reality reshaped everything.

Any dreams of an easy life vanished. We had to live on one income, as our son needed her extra attention. The State offered no financial help, leaving us swimming against a strong tide in costly Coastal SoCal.

Socially, we drifted to the margins. Other parents didn’t know what to say or how to act, and eventually, social invitations waned. Typical children preferred our son not to be around; many parents agreed, though they rarely said it out loud.

(Warning: This song induces compassion and floods of tears)

How could anyone ever tell you
you were anything less than beautiful?
How could anyone ever tell you
you were less than whole?
How could anyone fail to notice
that your loving is a miracle?
How deeply you’re connected to my soul.

How Could Anyone—Shaina Noll

We moved through those gatherings like ghosts, unseen yet painfully aware. Every outing, every casual chat turned awkward when someone mentioned their child's latest triumph, then realized ours provided less to rejoice in, the distaste of pity pasted our tongues.

At first, his condition felt like the worst thing that could have happened to us, a cruel joke of an evil demon bent on tormenting us.

In raising him, I found a side of myself I hadn’t known, a masculinity defined not by bravado but by care, patience, and unyielding love.

Whatever strength I brought to our marriage found its focus in him, and in that, I found purpose, even as the marriage relationship slowly unraveled.

If I had shown her the unconditional acceptance I showed him, my marriage would have been fabulous, live-enriching, rather than unrelenting torture.

A Sad Summary of a Forgettable Marriage
We rode the highs and weathered the lows, both of us pushed by a life that taxed us heavily. There were moments when opportunity shined bright—my career offered some good breaks, and we began to prosper, or at least thought we might. But for every gain, there was a loss. Ventures failed, money vanished, and often we found ourselves on the edge of financial ruin. 

We stayed together, but more for our son than for each other. Anger settled in; we couldn’t reach forgiveness before anger would reignite, turning anger into resentment.

Even in good times, SoCal’s cost of living was a constant battle. The crash in 2008 hit my real estate work hard, launching us into a dark period that furrowed my brows. Anxiety was the houseguest who wouldn’t leave. 

Later, through entrepreneurship, I made investments that promised a better future. But the benefits were distant, and the bills still came due each month. Every day was a grind, a slow burn of financial anxiety that unraveled the fabric that bound us.

Eventually, we left the coast for a more affordable, stress-free life. For me, a step toward something better, a chance to move forward. For her, a retreat, a loss of the life she knew, the weather, the rhythm, the things she loved. 

At last, we made it. After years of struggle, we reached the life we had always dreamed of—a place we thought was only for others. The strain of scraping by had lifted, the financial weight that had pressed on us for so long finally eased.

We found ourselves in a community where we could settle, build a life, and set down roots. We even had the dream house, one with space and quiet, somewhere we could call ours.

Before the move, her health began to falter—sciatica that clung to her like a shadow, leaving her in constant pain for almost three years. It was agony for her, a trial for all of us.

The relief of financial stability finally arrived, we moved into the dream, finally feeling at home, but by then, the road to get there had taken its toll. Even with less stress and better health, adjusting to desert life was a challenge.

Physical touch and emotional closeness
When we first moved in together, our days ended wrapped in each other’s arms, our passion relentless, like a fire we thought would never cool. Each night was alive with intensity, and we fell asleep tangled together, bodies and hearts close.

Unfortunately, the touch that once soothed her began to keep her awake. First, it was sleeping without embracing; then, it was sleeping without touching. Ostensibly, she couldn’t sleep because it made her think about me instead of sleeping, a pleasing lie.

Finally, she moved to another room where my night breathing wouldn’t disrupt her sleep (I don’t snore). With each incremental withdrawal, the intimacy we’d shared began to drift further away. 

Her desire for closeness waned, and as her health took a downturn, she wanted little more than relief from the pain, certainly not an amorous husband. 

Couples rarely last long if there are significant differences in levels of desire. Frustrations mount on both sides, and one of the best opportunities for connection becomes a source of friction. Her appetite for passion faded, while mine remained, adding tension to our relationship and stranding us on different cliffs of a widening chasm.

The minor disagreements—the ordinary quarrels of daily life—started to bite harder, more challenging to brush off without the bond we’d once had. With each little pull, the connection we’d built came undone, thread by thread, until finally, there was nothing left between us but distant memories and faded hopes. 

The love that once anchored us turned cold, replaced by a quiet indifference that blackened our lives.

We saw the fracture and knew that something vital had slipped away, and we tried to find our way back to each other. We went out, dressed up like we used to, and pretended the years hadn’t put miles between us.

But each time, the same old troubles crept back in, rising up like ghosts from the past, haunting whatever spark we hoped to reignite. We couldn’t shake them, couldn’t pretend the scars had faded.

Options for retirement opened up. For the first time, the horizon looked clear. We were poised for something great, but life had other plans.

I felt relief, a rare excitement for the days ahead, and I allowed myself to believe in the future.

In retrospect, I let myself feel the excitement too much.

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Good Riddance - Green Day

Best or Worst?
When our special needs son was born, at first, we believed it was the worst thing that could have happened to us, only later to recognize the priceless value.

When I had a profound spiritual experience, I believed it was the crowning achievement of 35 years of spiritual practice, the best outcome I could imagine. Later, I discovered the price was my marriage and family life.

Loss is gain, and gain is loss: the irony of the worldly winds.

What I Felt When I Won the Lottery

What I Felt When I Won the Lottery
I won the lottery… sort of.

Read full story
On October 30, 2023, My emotionally exuberant experience ended our marriage. 

About a month earlier, I’d received life-changing financial news that promised security and ease, a vision of a bright future for us all. That excitement simmered inside me, a pressure building until it felt like it would burst.

At around 5:30 in the evening, I felt it crest—a torrent of emotions I didn’t want to hold back. Surrounded by family, safe in our home, I let it flow.

In that moment, it felt like a spiritual awakening, something people chase after at revivals or on mountaintops, seeking a connection to something larger.

But in my home, it became the breaking point. The decision not to suppress the emotional onslaught and prevent the experience became the triggering event that finally prompted her to want out.

My Experience
I felt forces brewing inside of me that were building to something. I didn’t know what it was exactly, but I strongly suspected I was about to have an intense emotional experience, a heart cleansing.

I felt curiosity and excitement envelop me, the question arose: How much love can you channel? My adventurous spirit yearned to press the limits.

I began hugging and later jumping while embracing my 22-year-old special needs son.

My son loves me unconditionally, and his love and mine combined to bring about a powerful spiritual burst.

The feelings overwhelmed me, overtook any rational thought, and the emotions poured out, raw and untamed.

I jumped. I shouted. I moved.

I let the energy flow as it would, like a dam breaking open. 

I was empowered. OMG! I was really, really Empowered!!!

My heart light ignited, and I was ablaze!

Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see

Heartlight—Neil Diamond

In those first moments of true power, when the euphoria dulled just enough to feel the raw Qi surging through me, I could sense every chakra was blown open, the heart pulling most of the flow.

Gratitude for my training rose in me like a steadying anchor. To tame the chaos, my mind leaped to a familiar Lamrim meditation, instinctively seeking balance in the storm of energy. That meditation held the map to what was happening, grounding me, giving direction to the rush.

… through the power of our pure intention of wishing love and great accumulation of merit… Infinite light rays radiate from our body and pervade the entire universe, reaching the bodies and minds of all living beings and bestowing upon them the supreme happiness of permanent inner peace.

My heart felt like a quasar radiating light with such intensity that it outshone the entire Milky Way galaxy by a thousand times!

OMG!!!

Per my training, I held that feeling as long as I could, holding it, feeling it, watching it, marveling at the Power! It was incredible!!!

Perhaps you felt my Blessing? I assure you I did!

Imagine that experience! Blast Off!!!

I felt an emotional release like no other. Years—twenty-four of them—of financial tension, of stress, coiled tight around my nerves, vanished in an instant, never to return. 

My heart was suddenly unburdened; my whole body, every cell, came alive. 

My adrenaline surged, flooding me with a surge of energy that felt boundless, like life itself coursing through me, vivid and fierce.

For a while, my mind felt sharper, clearer, as if some fog had lifted and I could see straight to the heart of things. 

I felt connections I hadn’t felt before, a deeper sense of who I was and how the world moved. It was elation, pure and simple, the kind that takes hold of body and spirit. 

I felt magnificent—physically, mentally, every part of me alive in a way I hadn’t known possible.

Her Experience
Her experience was not as uplifting. In fact, it couldn’t have been further to the other extreme.

She was terrified. 

With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door.
You'd better run.

Run Like Hell—Pink Floyd

What I felt as a wave of life and release, she saw as something dark and dangerous. To her, it looked like madness—a psychotic break unraveling before her eyes. 

She feared for herself, for our son, feared what might happen if I lost control. Her entire life, the life we’d built, seemed to be crumbling, disintegrating right there in front of her.

When I brought my son into the moment, hoping to share what felt like a revelation, her fear only deepened. She worried I might harm him, her mind racing to protect him from whatever chaos she believed was unfolding. 

All she wanted was for it to stop, rewind time, and erase what she saw as a descent into madness, pretend it never happened. 

Two worldviews collide
For her, the experience was a nightmare. For me, it was dream come true. We couldn’t have seen things more differently.

It was the kind of divide that swallows everything whole, a chasm too wide to cross. She and I dug in, each clinging to our own version of the truth, unable to yield. 

Her Truth
For her, it had to be madness—bipolar mania. She saw my release, my elation, as nothing but a mental breakdown, a dark spiral that had terrified her. That fear consumed her, driving every angry action that followed.

In her panic, she called the police. In a state of euphoria, I needed to calmly assure three armed police I was no threat. She was unconvinced and left me alone for the night when I needed help the most.

The next day, we went to the clinic because I wanted to assure her I was in perfect health, better than ever, in fact. She was unwilling to believe the doctors who said my heart raced only with the thrill of the moment, my blood pressure high from emotion, not illness. 

She pretended to be accepting, but she bided her time. She waited until I spoke with an old friend, then clandestinely took our son, and dog, and slipped away. Taking our son she justified as motherly protection, but taking the dog was pure, petty revenge, intended to be hurtful.

She was really pissed off!!!

She left me stunned, horrified, stupified. I instinctively knew this meant my marriage was over, but hope, duty, remembered love, motivated me to try to make amends.

She withheld contact, holding our child and dog for ransom until I agreed to her terms, to her demands for a hospital admission.

I knew I was fine, so I surrendered, placated her, and hoped the act would bridge the gap. But that time in the mental health hospital was a nightmare I can’t erase. If I hadn’t been so strong, that place would have broken me.

And when I emerged, holding reports from doctors who saw no illness, she dismissed them all. Her mind was set, firm in her belief, convinced that anything less was too great a risk.

With that, the marriage was lost. 

She was committed to separation and divorce, no matter the consequences to her or the family, her aversion to me so strong that loneliness and destitution were preferable to our lives together.

I tried everything, going above and beyond to demonstrate wholeness and strength to save our marriage. Nothing I did mattered, and further resistance was futile. She was a machine bent on my destruction.

To her, separation and divorce seemed rational, almost prudent, a precaution taken for safety’s sake. But this certainty, this feeling of rationality and righteous justification depends entirely upon her belief, her reference frame, that says I am a weak man, buffeted by forces he can’t control, unstable, unable to support the family.

But to admit any other interpretation—a moment of spiritual awakening, a flood of life force—would mean I am none of the things she fears. Then she would have little choice but to face the harm her choices had done to both of us, taking responsibility for herself. 

She hasn’t accepted that yet. And, sadly, to her own detriment, she habitually chooses resentment over understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, so I doubt she ever will.

My Truth
I needed this to be a spiritual awakening; I needed it to be something pure and profound.

First and foremost, that’s what it felt like—a surge of energy that cracked open some new place within me. Yes, I was disoriented for a couple of days, flooded with intense emotion, but as the days passed, I felt something deepen; the event illuminated a hidden path to peace and wholeness. 

Except for those initial hours of irrationality, I’ve felt incredible ever since. This experience held personal power and gave me a clarity that I carried forward, no matter the cost.

I could have denied it all, buried my truth to make peace. 

I could have tried to believe her version, to see myself as broken. 

I could have swallowed that notion, pretending it was just an episode of mania and nothing more. But the lie would be hollow and dangerous, leaving me fragile, less than myself—a man stripped of his core. Such a surrender would be weak, cowardly, the kind of denial that kills slowly.

She would have seen me as pathetic, unworthy, a man who’s unstable, lacking leadership confidence. And even then, she would believe what she believed; nothing would change. 

For once, swallowing pride, usually a marriage best practice, was not the answer, not the solution to restore what was already gone.

But every morning, I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way, I see it mine
But we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other, baby
I guess that wasn't enough, oh-ooh-oh
But -
Oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

Best of My Love—The Eagles

Divorce was the Best Option
In the end, our separate needs were like repelling magnets, pushing us apart, with each of us clutching onto a version of reality that felt essential. She needed to see me as a weak man who had lost control; I needed to see myself as a strong man who’d broken through.

The marriage had no way forward, no common ground where both truths could live. 

Divorce was the only path left.

Having it Both Ways
From the outside, it looks so simple. Why couldn’t it be both a spiritual awakening and a manic episode? Why does one truth need to exclude the other? 

Because each of us has a vested emotional interest in rejecting the other’s worldview.

The problem with any spiritual experience is the subjectivity of it. Nobody knows what happened inside my mind and heart other than me. How I interpret my experience is for me alone to determine. Nobody can compel me to accept their interpretation of my subjective experience.

The truth of our complete freedom to interpret our own experiences is central to my spiritual practice, a truth I can’t ignore.

We can only rely on behavior to infer what’s happening in another’s mind. My behavior during the event and for a few days after was unusual. Doctors have their clinical definitions. To them, it fits under “bipolar manic episode,” ticking enough boxes that they could find a label. 

However, Western medicine has no room for spirituality or subjective experience. They are trained to see only what can be measured and classified, and any intense spiritual experience becomes a symptom, a condition to be treated, usually with powerful and unnecessary drugs.

Yet, to me, the experience was more than a medical event; it changed me deeply and reshaped the core of who I am. Afterward, there was a new peace, even amid life’s upheavals. My thoughts ran clearer, sharper; I found myself more open, even drawn to others. The inward walls I’d lived behind softened. 

This experience was more than an episode—it was a shift, a turning point.

In the year that’s transpired since this event, despite the upheavals and changes, I’ve remained calm and steady, and when not feeling sadness and mourning, I have been ecstatically happy, free from anxiety, and living with passion.

We held our separate truths like shields and still do. She needed to believe it was mania, a breakdown, something medical and understood. I needed to hold onto it as a breakthrough, a spiritual rise. 

We couldn’t bridge that gap. 

Both of us dug in, each demanding the right to interpret what happened as we saw it, unwilling to let the other’s truth stand, mocking each other for being foolish. So, we turned away from each other, leaving the marriage in fragments, fractured by the weight of our opposing beliefs.

Financial Freedom is Relationship Freedom
We reached a point of financial stability, which gave us a freedom we hadn’t felt before. For years, money had tethered us and kept us bound despite the cracks that spread through the marriage. With the security of going our separate ways, divorce was no longer an unbearable cost. 

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free

Born Free—Kid Rock

Her Reasons
Divorce was suddenly a viable option, and she clutched it like a lifeline to the freedom she didn’t enjoy in our marriage.

For her, the marriage had taken too much. She’d reached a breaking point, years ago, suffering in quiet despair until Life gifted her the keys to the prison door. 

She identified me as the root of her unhappiness, a source of relentless stress that had seeped into her body and mind. 

She believed I could never fully accept her or appreciate who she was—not in the way she needed, and she was right. Short of divorce, I might never have shown her the acceptance she sought or realized the error of my ways.

Intimacy was another fracture. She had come to view sex as a duty, something heavy and joyless, a burden rather than a bond. Between menopause and her angry feelings, pleasing me was not high on her to-do list.

The warmth between us had cooled, and she saw no path to rekindling it. She didn’t see the spark we had at the beginning, nor could she envision a future that promised any of the joy we’d once shared. 

She had a fistful of IOUs, but no pot of gold was waiting for her, only a long, empty road stretching on, and she didn’t want to walk it anymore.

Understanding her reasons and agreeing with them made it easier for me to drop the dutiful pursuit of reconciliation and let the marriage go without further resistance.

My Reasons
My reasons for leaving were just as clear and deeply felt. 

I had reached for her in a rare moment of need, vulnerable and hoping for support. Instead, I met silence and cold restraint. At that moment, I felt abandoned and let down in a way that cut deep.

That moment sealed something—I saw how easily she placed her needs above mine, discounting my value to zero. In that light, I couldn’t trust her to be there for me, nor could I allow her to decide for me if I could not choose for myself.

Years of unspoken grudges festered between us, a quiet poison. Every argument, big or small, would stir up those old wounds, reigniting a fire never fully extinguished. There was no peace there, only the echo of things we couldn’t let go of. 

It would never change, not with our stubbornness and need to keep control. She wanted submission from me that I couldn’t give, and I couldn’t bear her methods of holding back affection as leverage.

Our love reservoir had dried up, leaving only a mud flat, evaporated by bitterness and the absence of intimacy. If we stayed together, we’d be ghosts in each other’s lives, passing by in separate rooms, maybe sharing a few better moments here and there. 

There was no spark left, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for me either.

A friend flatly quipped, “So she hates you, and won’t fuck you. Good reasons for divorce.” His crass and accurate assessment cut through the extraneous bullshit like only a male friend can.

And maybe I had a reason to hope for a future after divorce. I was still healthy, strong, and potentially available for a new life partnership that could grow in ways she and I never could. I had options, and I needed to take them while they were still within reach.

Our Reasons
We were both worn down, every last reserve tapped. The years had wrung us out and left us dry and exhausted. The thought of reconciling lay heavy between us—a boulder we didn’t have the strength to lift. 

We could still see the faintest traces of joy, but they flickered too far in the distance, like something that belonged to other people. Years of bruised feelings and old resentments stood between us, festering wounds we never quite managed to heal. 

We couldn’t see a way forward, not with those ghosts hovering close, feeding off all that was broken and unfixable. There was no promise of bliss, no final, saving light—only the cold comfort of letting go.

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Go your own way—Fleetwood Mac

Amicable Split
We parted ways without rage or shouting, without the storm most expect from the end of two decades. We’d done the best we could, with the knowledge we had, with whatever maturity we managed to acquire. It hadn’t been enough, but it had been all we had. So we walked away, saddened but certain it was right. And when we moved to separate houses, a calm descended—a quiet relief from the everyday madness of each other.

Our son would still have us both, just ten minutes apart. We firmly agreed that his life would be sane and steady. He was why we’d stayed together for twenty years, though the love had faltered long before. We hope this peace holds for his sake. Ultimately, we aim to be kind to keep this truce. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll stay this way, amicable and calm, so our son has two parents, steady and solid, if only from a short distance away.

---

The story unfolds like a river winding through valleys of hope, over jagged rocks of despair, through swells of revelation, and into the calmer waters of acceptance. It begins as many tales of love do—with bright eyes and open hearts, fueled by the promise of a life unbroken. Marriage stood as a union of dreams, a tapestry woven from threads of passion and promise. But as the years rolled on, the weave frayed, tension pulling at every seam. Beneath the surface, where the whispers of resentment first stirred, an undercurrent began its steady work, dragging two hearts further apart.

Life pressed its weight upon them early. The need to choose bore down with the heavy hand of time, forcing decisions: children now, perhaps more later. Their son arrived, and with him, a truth both unexpected and transformative. Autism altered everything. It reshaped their rhythms and bent their dreams into shapes they could not have imagined. One income sustained them, the cost of Coastal California pressing in, grinding them down. Isolation followed, a social exile born of misunderstandings and the unspoken discomfort of others. They became ghosts at gatherings, fading into the backdrop, their son’s challenges a quiet wedge.

And yet, in the struggles of raising a child who needed so much, the father found his strength. The raw patience and unflinching care that fatherhood demanded became a mirror reflecting back a new kind of masculinity. It was there, in the quiet moments with his son, that purpose rose from the ashes of despair. But that strength, tested and true, could not mend what had unraveled between him and his wife.

Their marriage ebbed like a tide retreating from the shore. The touch that once healed became a source of unease, then avoidance. The warmth that had sustained them cooled to an indifferent chill. A chasm yawned between them, desire and resentment pulling them to separate cliffs. The small disagreements of daily life, once swept aside, began to linger, accumulating like layers of dust. Anger flared, settled into resentment, reignited, and hardened into a cycle they couldn’t break.

When fortune finally smiled—a financial windfall, the dream of stability realized—it came too late. The years of struggle had carved wounds too deep to heal. They left the coast for a quieter life, trading the chaos of survival for the hope of peace. But what should have been a new chapter only underscored the distance between them. Even as their surroundings grew serene, the discord within their hearts remained loud.

A moment of spiritual awakening for him—a rush of unbridled emotion and a sense of profound release—became, for her, a nightmare. Where he saw a breakthrough, she saw a breakdown. Where he found clarity, she found fear. The divide between their truths proved unbridgeable, each clinging to their perspective with a grip born of necessity. Her terror drove her to seek safety; his conviction anchored him in a new understanding of self. They could not meet in the middle.

The aftermath was quiet, almost subdued. No screaming matches, no violent parting blows. Just two people, worn and weary, walking away from a life they’d tried to build together but could no longer share. Financial freedom loosened the ties that had bound them through the years of struggle. Their son, the tether that had kept them together, would have both parents still—just apart, ten minutes away, a new rhythm to adjust to.

In the ashes of their marriage, there was a kind of peace. She sought the freedom to heal, to rediscover herself outside the shadow of what they’d been. He carried forward the lessons learned, the newfound clarity that the spiritual awakening had granted him. They had loved, lost, and let go, leaving behind fragments of a story they’d both held dear but could no longer carry.

Among the narrative’s currents are moments that linger like echoes. “Her desire for closeness waned, and as her health took a downturn, she wanted little more than relief from the pain, certainly not an amorous husband.” “The love that once anchored us turned cold, replaced by a quiet indifference that blackened our lives.” And then the sharp reflection: “If I had shown her the unconditional acceptance I showed him, my marriage would have been fabulous, life-enriching, rather than unrelenting torture.”

The emotional journey is raw, layered, and relentless. Hope gives way to hardship, hardship to resentment, resentment to revelation. Each realization builds on the last, like stones in a path that leads to a crossroads. From the early days of love and promise to the weight of parenthood, the struggles of financial strain, the sting of rejection, the fear of loss, and finally, the bittersweet calm of parting. Every step is marked by the echoes of the last, a slow unfolding of truths that refuse to be ignored.

The story ends not in triumph or tragedy, but in the quiet acknowledgment of what was and what could never be. In its stillness lies a kind of grace—a recognition that some stories, no matter how hopeful their beginnings, must end to allow their characters to move forward.

analyze the series part contained at the following "Every union starts with hope, dreams, aspirations for joy, marital bliss. Every relationship hits roadbumps, times of stress, some created by circumstance, most resulting from our reactions, pain we inflict in ignorance.

Our marriage remained through high points and low times, but beneath the facade ran a slow, steady decline, punctuated by hard crashes, inflicting wounds that wouldn’t heal. 

We’d just stepped into marriage when age pressed down, making choices for us, prompting us to have a child as quickly as possible, perhaps two.

A Special Child
When our son was born, we knew something was different. He was autistic, and that reality reshaped everything.

Any dreams of an easy life vanished. We had to live on one income, as our son needed her extra attention. The State offered no financial help, leaving us swimming against a strong tide in costly Coastal SoCal.

Socially, we drifted to the margins. Other parents didn’t know what to say or how to act, and eventually, social invitations waned. Typical children preferred our son not to be around; many parents agreed, though they rarely said it out loud.

(Warning: This song induces compassion and floods of tears)

How could anyone ever tell you
you were anything less than beautiful?
How could anyone ever tell you
you were less than whole?
How could anyone fail to notice
that your loving is a miracle?
How deeply you’re connected to my soul.

How Could Anyone—Shaina Noll

We moved through those gatherings like ghosts, unseen yet painfully aware. Every outing, every casual chat turned awkward when someone mentioned their child's latest triumph, then realized ours provided less to rejoice in, the distaste of pity pasted our tongues.

At first, his condition felt like the worst thing that could have happened to us, a cruel joke of an evil demon bent on tormenting us.

In raising him, I found a side of myself I hadn’t known, a masculinity defined not by bravado but by care, patience, and unyielding love.

Whatever strength I brought to our marriage found its focus in him, and in that, I found purpose, even as the marriage relationship slowly unraveled.

If I had shown her the unconditional acceptance I showed him, my marriage would have been fabulous, live-enriching, rather than unrelenting torture.

A Sad Summary of a Forgettable Marriage
We rode the highs and weathered the lows, both of us pushed by a life that taxed us heavily. There were moments when opportunity shined bright—my career offered some good breaks, and we began to prosper, or at least thought we might. But for every gain, there was a loss. Ventures failed, money vanished, and often we found ourselves on the edge of financial ruin. 

We stayed together, but more for our son than for each other. Anger settled in; we couldn’t reach forgiveness before anger would reignite, turning anger into resentment.

Even in good times, SoCal’s cost of living was a constant battle. The crash in 2008 hit my real estate work hard, launching us into a dark period that furrowed my brows. Anxiety was the houseguest who wouldn’t leave. 

Later, through entrepreneurship, I made investments that promised a better future. But the benefits were distant, and the bills still came due each month. Every day was a grind, a slow burn of financial anxiety that unraveled the fabric that bound us.

Eventually, we left the coast for a more affordable, stress-free life. For me, a step toward something better, a chance to move forward. For her, a retreat, a loss of the life she knew, the weather, the rhythm, the things she loved. 

At last, we made it. After years of struggle, we reached the life we had always dreamed of—a place we thought was only for others. The strain of scraping by had lifted, the financial weight that had pressed on us for so long finally eased.

We found ourselves in a community where we could settle, build a life, and set down roots. We even had the dream house, one with space and quiet, somewhere we could call ours.

Before the move, her health began to falter—sciatica that clung to her like a shadow, leaving her in constant pain for almost three years. It was agony for her, a trial for all of us.

The relief of financial stability finally arrived, we moved into the dream, finally feeling at home, but by then, the road to get there had taken its toll. Even with less stress and better health, adjusting to desert life was a challenge.

Physical touch and emotional closeness
When we first moved in together, our days ended wrapped in each other’s arms, our passion relentless, like a fire we thought would never cool. Each night was alive with intensity, and we fell asleep tangled together, bodies and hearts close.

Unfortunately, the touch that once soothed her began to keep her awake. First, it was sleeping without embracing; then, it was sleeping without touching. Ostensibly, she couldn’t sleep because it made her think about me instead of sleeping, a pleasing lie.

Finally, she moved to another room where my night breathing wouldn’t disrupt her sleep (I don’t snore). With each incremental withdrawal, the intimacy we’d shared began to drift further away. 

Her desire for closeness waned, and as her health took a downturn, she wanted little more than relief from the pain, certainly not an amorous husband. 

Couples rarely last long if there are significant differences in levels of desire. Frustrations mount on both sides, and one of the best opportunities for connection becomes a source of friction. Her appetite for passion faded, while mine remained, adding tension to our relationship and stranding us on different cliffs of a widening chasm.

The minor disagreements—the ordinary quarrels of daily life—started to bite harder, more challenging to brush off without the bond we’d once had. With each little pull, the connection we’d built came undone, thread by thread, until finally, there was nothing left between us but distant memories and faded hopes. 

The love that once anchored us turned cold, replaced by a quiet indifference that blackened our lives.

We saw the fracture and knew that something vital had slipped away, and we tried to find our way back to each other. We went out, dressed up like we used to, and pretended the years hadn’t put miles between us.

But each time, the same old troubles crept back in, rising up like ghosts from the past, haunting whatever spark we hoped to reignite. We couldn’t shake them, couldn’t pretend the scars had faded.

Options for retirement opened up. For the first time, the horizon looked clear. We were poised for something great, but life had other plans.

I felt relief, a rare excitement for the days ahead, and I allowed myself to believe in the future.

In retrospect, I let myself feel the excitement too much.

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Good Riddance - Green Day

Best or Worst?
When our special needs son was born, at first, we believed it was the worst thing that could have happened to us, only later to recognize the priceless value.

When I had a profound spiritual experience, I believed it was the crowning achievement of 35 years of spiritual practice, the best outcome I could imagine. Later, I discovered the price was my marriage and family life.

Loss is gain, and gain is loss: the irony of the worldly winds.

What I Felt When I Won the Lottery

What I Felt When I Won the Lottery
I won the lottery… sort of.

Read full story
On October 30, 2023, My emotionally exuberant experience ended our marriage. 

About a month earlier, I’d received life-changing financial news that promised security and ease, a vision of a bright future for us all. That excitement simmered inside me, a pressure building until it felt like it would burst.

At around 5:30 in the evening, I felt it crest—a torrent of emotions I didn’t want to hold back. Surrounded by family, safe in our home, I let it flow.

In that moment, it felt like a spiritual awakening, something people chase after at revivals or on mountaintops, seeking a connection to something larger.

But in my home, it became the breaking point. The decision not to suppress the emotional onslaught and prevent the experience became the triggering event that finally prompted her to want out.

My Experience
I felt forces brewing inside of me that were building to something. I didn’t know what it was exactly, but I strongly suspected I was about to have an intense emotional experience, a heart cleansing.

I felt curiosity and excitement envelop me, the question arose: How much love can you channel? My adventurous spirit yearned to press the limits.

I began hugging and later jumping while embracing my 22-year-old special needs son.

My son loves me unconditionally, and his love and mine combined to bring about a powerful spiritual burst.

The feelings overwhelmed me, overtook any rational thought, and the emotions poured out, raw and untamed.

I jumped. I shouted. I moved.

I let the energy flow as it would, like a dam breaking open. 

I was empowered. OMG! I was really, really Empowered!!!

My heart light ignited, and I was ablaze!

Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see

Heartlight—Neil Diamond

In those first moments of true power, when the euphoria dulled just enough to feel the raw Qi surging through me, I could sense every chakra was blown open, the heart pulling most of the flow.

Gratitude for my training rose in me like a steadying anchor. To tame the chaos, my mind leaped to a familiar Lamrim meditation, instinctively seeking balance in the storm of energy. That meditation held the map to what was happening, grounding me, giving direction to the rush.

… through the power of our pure intention of wishing love and great accumulation of merit… Infinite light rays radiate from our body and pervade the entire universe, reaching the bodies and minds of all living beings and bestowing upon them the supreme happiness of permanent inner peace.

My heart felt like a quasar radiating light with such intensity that it outshone the entire Milky Way galaxy by a thousand times!

OMG!!!

Per my training, I held that feeling as long as I could, holding it, feeling it, watching it, marveling at the Power! It was incredible!!!

Perhaps you felt my Blessing? I assure you I did!

Imagine that experience! Blast Off!!!

I felt an emotional release like no other. Years—twenty-four of them—of financial tension, of stress, coiled tight around my nerves, vanished in an instant, never to return. 

My heart was suddenly unburdened; my whole body, every cell, came alive. 

My adrenaline surged, flooding me with a surge of energy that felt boundless, like life itself coursing through me, vivid and fierce.

For a while, my mind felt sharper, clearer, as if some fog had lifted and I could see straight to the heart of things. 

I felt connections I hadn’t felt before, a deeper sense of who I was and how the world moved. It was elation, pure and simple, the kind that takes hold of body and spirit. 

I felt magnificent—physically, mentally, every part of me alive in a way I hadn’t known possible.

Her Experience
Her experience was not as uplifting. In fact, it couldn’t have been further to the other extreme.

She was terrified. 

With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door.
You'd better run.

Run Like Hell—Pink Floyd

What I felt as a wave of life and release, she saw as something dark and dangerous. To her, it looked like madness—a psychotic break unraveling before her eyes. 

She feared for herself, for our son, feared what might happen if I lost control. Her entire life, the life we’d built, seemed to be crumbling, disintegrating right there in front of her.

When I brought my son into the moment, hoping to share what felt like a revelation, her fear only deepened. She worried I might harm him, her mind racing to protect him from whatever chaos she believed was unfolding. 

All she wanted was for it to stop, rewind time, and erase what she saw as a descent into madness, pretend it never happened. 

Two worldviews collide
For her, the experience was a nightmare. For me, it was dream come true. We couldn’t have seen things more differently.

It was the kind of divide that swallows everything whole, a chasm too wide to cross. She and I dug in, each clinging to our own version of the truth, unable to yield. 

Her Truth
For her, it had to be madness—bipolar mania. She saw my release, my elation, as nothing but a mental breakdown, a dark spiral that had terrified her. That fear consumed her, driving every angry action that followed.

In her panic, she called the police. In a state of euphoria, I needed to calmly assure three armed police I was no threat. She was unconvinced and left me alone for the night when I needed help the most.

The next day, we went to the clinic because I wanted to assure her I was in perfect health, better than ever, in fact. She was unwilling to believe the doctors who said my heart raced only with the thrill of the moment, my blood pressure high from emotion, not illness. 

She pretended to be accepting, but she bided her time. She waited until I spoke with an old friend, then clandestinely took our son, and dog, and slipped away. Taking our son she justified as motherly protection, but taking the dog was pure, petty revenge, intended to be hurtful.

She was really pissed off!!!

She left me stunned, horrified, stupified. I instinctively knew this meant my marriage was over, but hope, duty, remembered love, motivated me to try to make amends.

She withheld contact, holding our child and dog for ransom until I agreed to her terms, to her demands for a hospital admission.

I knew I was fine, so I surrendered, placated her, and hoped the act would bridge the gap. But that time in the mental health hospital was a nightmare I can’t erase. If I hadn’t been so strong, that place would have broken me.

And when I emerged, holding reports from doctors who saw no illness, she dismissed them all. Her mind was set, firm in her belief, convinced that anything less was too great a risk.

With that, the marriage was lost. 

She was committed to separation and divorce, no matter the consequences to her or the family, her aversion to me so strong that loneliness and destitution were preferable to our lives together.

I tried everything, going above and beyond to demonstrate wholeness and strength to save our marriage. Nothing I did mattered, and further resistance was futile. She was a machine bent on my destruction.

To her, separation and divorce seemed rational, almost prudent, a precaution taken for safety’s sake. But this certainty, this feeling of rationality and righteous justification depends entirely upon her belief, her reference frame, that says I am a weak man, buffeted by forces he can’t control, unstable, unable to support the family.

But to admit any other interpretation—a moment of spiritual awakening, a flood of life force—would mean I am none of the things she fears. Then she would have little choice but to face the harm her choices had done to both of us, taking responsibility for herself. 

She hasn’t accepted that yet. And, sadly, to her own detriment, she habitually chooses resentment over understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, so I doubt she ever will.

My Truth
I needed this to be a spiritual awakening; I needed it to be something pure and profound.

First and foremost, that’s what it felt like—a surge of energy that cracked open some new place within me. Yes, I was disoriented for a couple of days, flooded with intense emotion, but as the days passed, I felt something deepen; the event illuminated a hidden path to peace and wholeness. 

Except for those initial hours of irrationality, I’ve felt incredible ever since. This experience held personal power and gave me a clarity that I carried forward, no matter the cost.

I could have denied it all, buried my truth to make peace. 

I could have tried to believe her version, to see myself as broken. 

I could have swallowed that notion, pretending it was just an episode of mania and nothing more. But the lie would be hollow and dangerous, leaving me fragile, less than myself—a man stripped of his core. Such a surrender would be weak, cowardly, the kind of denial that kills slowly.

She would have seen me as pathetic, unworthy, a man who’s unstable, lacking leadership confidence. And even then, she would believe what she believed; nothing would change. 

For once, swallowing pride, usually a marriage best practice, was not the answer, not the solution to restore what was already gone.

But every morning, I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way, I see it mine
But we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other, baby
I guess that wasn't enough, oh-ooh-oh
But -
Oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

Best of My Love—The Eagles

Divorce was the Best Option
In the end, our separate needs were like repelling magnets, pushing us apart, with each of us clutching onto a version of reality that felt essential. She needed to see me as a weak man who had lost control; I needed to see myself as a strong man who’d broken through.

The marriage had no way forward, no common ground where both truths could live. 

Divorce was the only path left.

Having it Both Ways
From the outside, it looks so simple. Why couldn’t it be both a spiritual awakening and a manic episode? Why does one truth need to exclude the other? 

Because each of us has a vested emotional interest in rejecting the other’s worldview.

The problem with any spiritual experience is the subjectivity of it. Nobody knows what happened inside my mind and heart other than me. How I interpret my experience is for me alone to determine. Nobody can compel me to accept their interpretation of my subjective experience.

The truth of our complete freedom to interpret our own experiences is central to my spiritual practice, a truth I can’t ignore.

We can only rely on behavior to infer what’s happening in another’s mind. My behavior during the event and for a few days after was unusual. Doctors have their clinical definitions. To them, it fits under “bipolar manic episode,” ticking enough boxes that they could find a label. 

However, Western medicine has no room for spirituality or subjective experience. They are trained to see only what can be measured and classified, and any intense spiritual experience becomes a symptom, a condition to be treated, usually with powerful and unnecessary drugs.

Yet, to me, the experience was more than a medical event; it changed me deeply and reshaped the core of who I am. Afterward, there was a new peace, even amid life’s upheavals. My thoughts ran clearer, sharper; I found myself more open, even drawn to others. The inward walls I’d lived behind softened. 

This experience was more than an episode—it was a shift, a turning point.

In the year that’s transpired since this event, despite the upheavals and changes, I’ve remained calm and steady, and when not feeling sadness and mourning, I have been ecstatically happy, free from anxiety, and living with passion.

We held our separate truths like shields and still do. She needed to believe it was mania, a breakdown, something medical and understood. I needed to hold onto it as a breakthrough, a spiritual rise. 

We couldn’t bridge that gap. 

Both of us dug in, each demanding the right to interpret what happened as we saw it, unwilling to let the other’s truth stand, mocking each other for being foolish. So, we turned away from each other, leaving the marriage in fragments, fractured by the weight of our opposing beliefs.

Financial Freedom is Relationship Freedom
We reached a point of financial stability, which gave us a freedom we hadn’t felt before. For years, money had tethered us and kept us bound despite the cracks that spread through the marriage. With the security of going our separate ways, divorce was no longer an unbearable cost. 

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free

Born Free—Kid Rock

Her Reasons
Divorce was suddenly a viable option, and she clutched it like a lifeline to the freedom she didn’t enjoy in our marriage.

For her, the marriage had taken too much. She’d reached a breaking point, years ago, suffering in quiet despair until Life gifted her the keys to the prison door. 

She identified me as the root of her unhappiness, a source of relentless stress that had seeped into her body and mind. 

She believed I could never fully accept her or appreciate who she was—not in the way she needed, and she was right. Short of divorce, I might never have shown her the acceptance she sought or realized the error of my ways.

Intimacy was another fracture. She had come to view sex as a duty, something heavy and joyless, a burden rather than a bond. Between menopause and her angry feelings, pleasing me was not high on her to-do list.

The warmth between us had cooled, and she saw no path to rekindling it. She didn’t see the spark we had at the beginning, nor could she envision a future that promised any of the joy we’d once shared. 

She had a fistful of IOUs, but no pot of gold was waiting for her, only a long, empty road stretching on, and she didn’t want to walk it anymore.

Understanding her reasons and agreeing with them made it easier for me to drop the dutiful pursuit of reconciliation and let the marriage go without further resistance.

My Reasons
My reasons for leaving were just as clear and deeply felt. 

I had reached for her in a rare moment of need, vulnerable and hoping for support. Instead, I met silence and cold restraint. At that moment, I felt abandoned and let down in a way that cut deep.

That moment sealed something—I saw how easily she placed her needs above mine, discounting my value to zero. In that light, I couldn’t trust her to be there for me, nor could I allow her to decide for me if I could not choose for myself.

Years of unspoken grudges festered between us, a quiet poison. Every argument, big or small, would stir up those old wounds, reigniting a fire never fully extinguished. There was no peace there, only the echo of things we couldn’t let go of. 

It would never change, not with our stubbornness and need to keep control. She wanted submission from me that I couldn’t give, and I couldn’t bear her methods of holding back affection as leverage.

Our love reservoir had dried up, leaving only a mud flat, evaporated by bitterness and the absence of intimacy. If we stayed together, we’d be ghosts in each other’s lives, passing by in separate rooms, maybe sharing a few better moments here and there. 

There was no spark left, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for me either.

A friend flatly quipped, “So she hates you, and won’t fuck you. Good reasons for divorce.” His crass and accurate assessment cut through the extraneous bullshit like only a male friend can.

And maybe I had a reason to hope for a future after divorce. I was still healthy, strong, and potentially available for a new life partnership that could grow in ways she and I never could. I had options, and I needed to take them while they were still within reach.

Our Reasons
We were both worn down, every last reserve tapped. The years had wrung us out and left us dry and exhausted. The thought of reconciling lay heavy between us—a boulder we didn’t have the strength to lift. 

We could still see the faintest traces of joy, but they flickered too far in the distance, like something that belonged to other people. Years of bruised feelings and old resentments stood between us, festering wounds we never quite managed to heal. 

We couldn’t see a way forward, not with those ghosts hovering close, feeding off all that was broken and unfixable. There was no promise of bliss, no final, saving light—only the cold comfort of letting go.

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Go your own way—Fleetwood Mac

Amicable Split
We parted ways without rage or shouting, without the storm most expect from the end of two decades. We’d done the best we could, with the knowledge we had, with whatever maturity we managed to acquire. It hadn’t been enough, but it had been all we had. So we walked away, saddened but certain it was right. And when we moved to separate houses, a calm descended—a quiet relief from the everyday madness of each other.

Our son would still have us both, just ten minutes apart. We firmly agreed that his life would be sane and steady. He was why we’d stayed together for twenty years, though the love had faltered long before. We hope this peace holds for his sake. Ultimately, we aim to be kind to keep this truce. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll stay this way, amicable and calm, so our son has two parents, steady and solid, if only from a short distance away.

The story begins as most unions do, with hope, aspirations, and dreams of a life shared in bliss. But life, cruel and unrelenting, doesn’t honor promises made in the glow of young love. Beneath the facade of our marriage, a slow erosion began, subtle at first, then punctuated by moments of despair that left scars too deep to heal. It wasn’t long before life pressed its weight upon us. Choices, shaped by age and time, came fast. A child, perhaps two, would anchor us, or so we thought.

When our son arrived, joy mixed with uncertainty. He was different, and soon we learned he was autistic. That reality reshaped every corner of our lives, stripping away dreams of ease and forcing us to navigate a world unkind to families like ours. One income sustained us as Coastal California's costs gnawed at our sanity. Isolation followed. Social circles thinned as others drifted, unable—or unwilling—to accept our son’s challenges. We became ghosts, moving through gatherings with a painful awareness of our outsider status. Each moment reminded us of what we’d lost, every casual remark from other parents a dagger twisting in silence.

At first, his condition felt like a curse, a cruel cosmic joke. But over time, clarity emerged. His quiet strength became a mirror, reflecting the best of me. I found in myself a masculinity forged not in bravado but in patience, love, and care. My focus shifted entirely to him, while my relationship with her unraveled thread by thread.

Our marriage, tethered by duty and the needs of our son, frayed further with each setback. Financial stress, amplified by the 2008 crash, clawed at us. Opportunities came and went, victories tempered by inevitable losses. We left the coast for affordability, but the move deepened the rift. For me, it was hope; for her, retreat. Even as financial relief finally arrived, the scars of the journey remained. Physical touch, once a salve, turned to ash. Each withdrawal—first nights apart, then separate rooms—widened the chasm.

Time did not heal but hardened. Anger simmered into resentment, and intimacy became a distant memory. We dressed up the past, tried to reignite the flame, but ghosts of old arguments loomed, their shadows too long to escape. Her health waned; my frustrations mounted. Love, once our anchor, turned cold and indifferent. 

Then came the awakening. A rush of emotion, raw and untamed, burst from within me. Years of tension, fear, and stress dissolved in a single moment of elation, a spiritual surge I couldn’t contain. For me, it was liberation; for her, madness. She saw danger where I saw transcendence. Her fear drove her to action, her belief in my instability cutting deeper than any argument ever had. I stood before police, a beacon of calm, yet alone in a house of crumbling trust.

Her mind was set. She took our son and left, demanding proof of my sanity, ignoring every assurance I offered. I bent to her terms, even endured the indignities of a mental health hospital, but nothing could restore what was broken. The marriage, already brittle, shattered under the weight of her fear and my unyielding truth. She clung to her narrative; I held to mine. Divorce was inevitable—a split not of anger but of necessity. We had become repelling forces, each too entrenched to yield.

Yet, in the wreckage, there was clarity. She sought freedom from years of unhappiness, and I couldn’t blame her. My needs, unmet and unspoken, had built a quiet fortress of resentment. What was once love had become duty; what was once passion had turned to obligation. We parted without venom but with a heavy resignation, leaving only faint hopes that our son might thrive despite our failure to do so together.

The journey was not a tragedy, nor was it a triumph. It was a story of survival, of flawed love stretched beyond its breaking point. The lessons came hard, the realizations brutal. Love demands more than care; it requires acceptance. And yet, even with that truth, we couldn’t bridge the divide. We were two ships, once tethered, now set adrift, seeking calmer waters.

One income sustained us as Coastal California's costs gnawed at our sanity. Isolation followed. Social circles thinned as others drifted, unable—or unwilling—to accept our son’s challenges. We became ghosts, moving through gatherings with a painful awareness of our outsider status. Each moment reminded us of what we’d lost, every casual remark from other parents a dagger twisting in silence.

At first, his condition felt like a curse, a cruel cosmic joke. But over time, clarity emerged. His quiet strength became a mirror, reflecting the best of me. I found in myself a masculinity forged not in bravado but in patience, love, and care. My focus shifted entirely to him, while my relationship with her unraveled thread by thread.

Our marriage, tethered by duty and the needs of our son, frayed further with each setback. Financial stress, amplified by the 2008 crash, clawed at us. Opportunities came and went, victories tempered by inevitable losses. We left the coast for affordability, but the move deepened the rift. For me, it was hope; for her, retreat. Even as financial relief finally arrived, the scars of the journey remained. Physical touch, once a salve, turned to ash. Each withdrawal—first nights apart, then separate rooms—widened the chasm.

Time did not heal but hardened. Anger simmered into resentment, and intimacy became a distant memory. We dressed up the past, tried to reignite the flame, but ghosts of old arguments loomed, their shadows too long to escape. Her health waned; my frustrations mounted. Love, once our anchor, turned cold and indifferent.

Then came the awakening. A rush of emotion, raw and untamed, burst from within me. Years of tension, fear, and stress dissolved in a single moment of elation, a spiritual surge I couldn’t contain. For me, it was liberation; for her, madness. She saw danger where I saw transcendence. Her fear drove her to action, her belief in my instability cutting deeper than any argument ever had. I stood before police, a beacon of calm, yet alone in a house of crumbling trust.

Her mind was set. She took our son and left, demanding proof of my sanity, ignoring every assurance I offered. I bent to her terms, even endured the indignities of a mental health hospital, but nothing could restore what was broken. The marriage, already brittle, shattered under the weight of her fear and my unyielding truth. She clung to her narrative; I held to mine. Divorce was inevitable—a split not of anger but of necessity. We had become repelling forces, each too entrenched to yield.

Yet, in the wreckage, there was clarity. She sought freedom from years of unhappiness, and I couldn’t blame her. My needs, unmet and unspoken, had built a quiet fortress of resentment. What was once love had become duty; what was once passion had turned to obligation. We parted without venom but with a heavy resignation, leaving only faint hopes that our son might thrive despite our failure to do so together.

The journey was not a tragedy, nor was it a triumph. It was a story of survival, of flawed love stretched beyond its breaking point. The lessons came hard, the realizations brutal. Love demands more than care; it requires acceptance. And yet, even with that truth, we couldn’t bridge the divide. We were two ships, once tethered, now set adrift, seeking calmer waters."<br>

The story begins as most unions start, with hope, aspirations, and dreams of a life shared in bliss. But life, cruel and unrelenting, ignores promises forged in the glow of young love. Beneath the facade of our marriage, a slow erosion crept in, subtle at first, then punctuated by moments of despair that carved deep scars. Life pressed its weight upon us. Choices, shaped by age and time, arrived quickly. A child, perhaps two, would anchor us—or so we believed.

When our son arrived, joy collided with uncertainty. He differed from other children, and soon we learned he was autistic. That reality reshaped every corner of our lives, stripping away dreams of ease and forcing us to navigate a world unkind to families like ours. One income sustained us while Coastal California's costs gnawed at our sanity. Isolation followed. Social circles shrank as others drifted, unwilling or unable to accept our son’s challenges. We faded into gatherings like ghosts, painfully aware of our outsider status. Each moment reminded us of what we’d lost; every casual remark from other parents struck like a dagger, twisting silently.

At first, his condition felt like a curse, a cruel cosmic joke. Over time, clarity unfolded. His quiet strength mirrored the best of me, reflecting qualities I hadn’t recognized.

We parted without venom but with heavy resignation, leaving faint hopes that our son might thrive despite our failure to thrive together.

analyze the series part contained at the following

"Every union starts with hope, dreams, aspirations for joy, marital bliss. Every relationship hits roadbumps, times of stress, some created by circumstance, most resulting from our reactions, pain we inflict in ignorance.

Our marriage remained through high points and low times, but beneath the facade ran a slow, steady decline, punctuated by hard crashes, inflicting wounds that wouldn’t heal. 

We’d just stepped into marriage when age pressed down, making choices for us, prompting us to have a child as quickly as possible, perhaps two.

When our son was born, we knew something was different. He was autistic, and that reality reshaped everything.

Any dreams of an easy life vanished. We had to live on one income, as our son needed her extra attention. The State offered no financial help, leaving us swimming against a strong tide in costly Coastal SoCal.

Socially, we drifted to the margins. Other parents didn’t know what to say or how to act, and eventually, social invitations waned. Typical children preferred our son not to be around; many parents agreed, though they rarely said it out loud.

(Warning: This song induces compassion and floods of tears)

How could anyone ever tell you
you were anything less than beautiful?
How could anyone ever tell you
you were less than whole?
How could anyone fail to notice
that your loving is a miracle?
How deeply you’re connected to my soul.

How Could Anyone—Shaina Noll

We moved through those gatherings like ghosts, unseen yet painfully aware. Every outing, every casual chat turned awkward when someone mentioned their child's latest triumph, then realized ours provided less to rejoice in, the distaste of pity pasted our tongues.

At first, his condition felt like the worst thing that could have happened to us, a cruel joke of an evil demon bent on tormenting us.

In raising him, I found a side of myself I hadn’t known, a masculinity defined not by bravado but by care, patience, and unyielding love.

Whatever strength I brought to our marriage found its focus in him, and in that, I found purpose, even as the marriage relationship slowly unraveled.

If I had shown her the unconditional acceptance I showed him, my marriage would have been fabulous, live-enriching, rather than unrelenting torture.

A Sad Summary of a Forgettable Marriage
We rode the highs and weathered the lows, both of us pushed by a life that taxed us heavily. There were moments when opportunity shined bright—my career offered some good breaks, and we began to prosper, or at least thought we might. But for every gain, there was a loss. Ventures failed, money vanished, and often we found ourselves on the edge of financial ruin. 

We stayed together, but more for our son than for each other. Anger settled in; we couldn’t reach forgiveness before anger would reignite, turning anger into resentment.

Even in good times, SoCal’s cost of living was a constant battle. The crash in 2008 hit my real estate work hard, launching us into a dark period that furrowed my brows. Anxiety was the houseguest who wouldn’t leave. 

Later, through entrepreneurship, I made investments that promised a better future. But the benefits were distant, and the bills still came due each month. Every day was a grind, a slow burn of financial anxiety that unraveled the fabric that bound us.

Eventually, we left the coast for a more affordable, stress-free life. For me, a step toward something better, a chance to move forward. For her, a retreat, a loss of the life she knew, the weather, the rhythm, the things she loved. 

At last, we made it. After years of struggle, we reached the life we had always dreamed of—a place we thought was only for others. The strain of scraping by had lifted, the financial weight that had pressed on us for so long finally eased.

We found ourselves in a community where we could settle, build a life, and set down roots. We even had the dream house, one with space and quiet, somewhere we could call ours.

Before the move, her health began to falter—sciatica that clung to her like a shadow, leaving her in constant pain for almost three years. It was agony for her, a trial for all of us.

The relief of financial stability finally arrived, we moved into the dream, finally feeling at home, but by then, the road to get there had taken its toll. Even with less stress and better health, adjusting to desert life was a challenge.

Physical touch and emotional closeness
When we first moved in together, our days ended wrapped in each other’s arms, our passion relentless, like a fire we thought would never cool. Each night was alive with intensity, and we fell asleep tangled together, bodies and hearts close.

Unfortunately, the touch that once soothed her began to keep her awake. First, it was sleeping without embracing; then, it was sleeping without touching. Ostensibly, she couldn’t sleep because it made her think about me instead of sleeping, a pleasing lie.

Finally, she moved to another room where my night breathing wouldn’t disrupt her sleep (I don’t snore). With each incremental withdrawal, the intimacy we’d shared began to drift further away. 

Her desire for closeness waned, and as her health took a downturn, she wanted little more than relief from the pain, certainly not an amorous husband. 

Couples rarely last long if there are significant differences in levels of desire. Frustrations mount on both sides, and one of the best opportunities for connection becomes a source of friction. Her appetite for passion faded, while mine remained, adding tension to our relationship and stranding us on different cliffs of a widening chasm.

The minor disagreements—the ordinary quarrels of daily life—started to bite harder, more challenging to brush off without the bond we’d once had. With each little pull, the connection we’d built came undone, thread by thread, until finally, there was nothing left between us but distant memories and faded hopes. 

The love that once anchored us turned cold, replaced by a quiet indifference that blackened our lives.

We saw the fracture and knew that something vital had slipped away, and we tried to find our way back to each other. We went out, dressed up like we used to, and pretended the years hadn’t put miles between us.

But each time, the same old troubles crept back in, rising up like ghosts from the past, haunting whatever spark we hoped to reignite. We couldn’t shake them, couldn’t pretend the scars had faded.

Options for retirement opened up. For the first time, the horizon looked clear. We were poised for something great, but life had other plans.

I felt relief, a rare excitement for the days ahead, and I allowed myself to believe in the future.

In retrospect, I let myself feel the excitement too much.

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Good Riddance - Green Day

Best or Worst?
When our special needs son was born, at first, we believed it was the worst thing that could have happened to us, only later to recognize the priceless value.

When I had a profound spiritual experience, I believed it was the crowning achievement of 35 years of spiritual practice, the best outcome I could imagine. Later, I discovered the price was my marriage and family life.

Loss is gain, and gain is loss: the irony of the worldly winds.

What I Felt When I Won the Lottery

What I Felt When I Won the Lottery
I won the lottery… sort of.

Read full story
On October 30, 2023, My emotionally exuberant experience ended our marriage. 

About a month earlier, I’d received life-changing financial news that promised security and ease, a vision of a bright future for us all. That excitement simmered inside me, a pressure building until it felt like it would burst.

At around 5:30 in the evening, I felt it crest—a torrent of emotions I didn’t want to hold back. Surrounded by family, safe in our home, I let it flow.

In that moment, it felt like a spiritual awakening, something people chase after at revivals or on mountaintops, seeking a connection to something larger.

But in my home, it became the breaking point. The decision not to suppress the emotional onslaught and prevent the experience became the triggering event that finally prompted her to want out.

My Experience
I felt forces brewing inside of me that were building to something. I didn’t know what it was exactly, but I strongly suspected I was about to have an intense emotional experience, a heart cleansing.

I felt curiosity and excitement envelop me, the question arose: How much love can you channel? My adventurous spirit yearned to press the limits.

I began hugging and later jumping while embracing my 22-year-old special needs son.

My son loves me unconditionally, and his love and mine combined to bring about a powerful spiritual burst.

The feelings overwhelmed me, overtook any rational thought, and the emotions poured out, raw and untamed.

I jumped. I shouted. I moved.

I let the energy flow as it would, like a dam breaking open. 

I was empowered. OMG! I was really, really Empowered!!!

My heart light ignited, and I was ablaze!

Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see

Heartlight—Neil Diamond

In those first moments of true power, when the euphoria dulled just enough to feel the raw Qi surging through me, I could sense every chakra was blown open, the heart pulling most of the flow.

Gratitude for my training rose in me like a steadying anchor. To tame the chaos, my mind leaped to a familiar Lamrim meditation, instinctively seeking balance in the storm of energy. That meditation held the map to what was happening, grounding me, giving direction to the rush.

… through the power of our pure intention of wishing love and great accumulation of merit… Infinite light rays radiate from our body and pervade the entire universe, reaching the bodies and minds of all living beings and bestowing upon them the supreme happiness of permanent inner peace.

My heart felt like a quasar radiating light with such intensity that it outshone the entire Milky Way galaxy by a thousand times!

OMG!!!

Per my training, I held that feeling as long as I could, holding it, feeling it, watching it, marveling at the Power! It was incredible!!!

Perhaps you felt my Blessing? I assure you I did!

Imagine that experience! Blast Off!!!

I felt an emotional release like no other. Years—twenty-four of them—of financial tension, of stress, coiled tight around my nerves, vanished in an instant, never to return. 

My heart was suddenly unburdened; my whole body, every cell, came alive. 

My adrenaline surged, flooding me with a surge of energy that felt boundless, like life itself coursing through me, vivid and fierce.

For a while, my mind felt sharper, clearer, as if some fog had lifted and I could see straight to the heart of things. 

I felt connections I hadn’t felt before, a deeper sense of who I was and how the world moved. It was elation, pure and simple, the kind that takes hold of body and spirit. 

I felt magnificent—physically, mentally, every part of me alive in a way I hadn’t known possible.

Her Experience
Her experience was not as uplifting. In fact, it couldn’t have been further to the other extreme.

She was terrified. 

With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door.
You'd better run.

Run Like Hell—Pink Floyd

What I felt as a wave of life and release, she saw as something dark and dangerous. To her, it looked like madness—a psychotic break unraveling before her eyes. 

She feared for herself, for our son, feared what might happen if I lost control. Her entire life, the life we’d built, seemed to be crumbling, disintegrating right there in front of her.

When I brought my son into the moment, hoping to share what felt like a revelation, her fear only deepened. She worried I might harm him, her mind racing to protect him from whatever chaos she believed was unfolding. 

All she wanted was for it to stop, rewind time, and erase what she saw as a descent into madness, pretend it never happened. 

Two worldviews collide
For her, the experience was a nightmare. For me, it was dream come true. We couldn’t have seen things more differently.

It was the kind of divide that swallows everything whole, a chasm too wide to cross. She and I dug in, each clinging to our own version of the truth, unable to yield. 

Her Truth
For her, it had to be madness—bipolar mania. She saw my release, my elation, as nothing but a mental breakdown, a dark spiral that had terrified her. That fear consumed her, driving every angry action that followed.

In her panic, she called the police. In a state of euphoria, I needed to calmly assure three armed police I was no threat. She was unconvinced and left me alone for the night when I needed help the most.

The next day, we went to the clinic because I wanted to assure her I was in perfect health, better than ever, in fact. She was unwilling to believe the doctors who said my heart raced only with the thrill of the moment, my blood pressure high from emotion, not illness. 

She pretended to be accepting, but she bided her time. She waited until I spoke with an old friend, then clandestinely took our son, and dog, and slipped away. Taking our son she justified as motherly protection, but taking the dog was pure, petty revenge, intended to be hurtful.

She was really pissed off!!!

She left me stunned, horrified, stupified. I instinctively knew this meant my marriage was over, but hope, duty, remembered love, motivated me to try to make amends.

She withheld contact, holding our child and dog for ransom until I agreed to her terms, to her demands for a hospital admission.

I knew I was fine, so I surrendered, placated her, and hoped the act would bridge the gap. But that time in the mental health hospital was a nightmare I can’t erase. If I hadn’t been so strong, that place would have broken me.

And when I emerged, holding reports from doctors who saw no illness, she dismissed them all. Her mind was set, firm in her belief, convinced that anything less was too great a risk.

With that, the marriage was lost. 

She was committed to separation and divorce, no matter the consequences to her or the family, her aversion to me so strong that loneliness and destitution were preferable to our lives together.

I tried everything, going above and beyond to demonstrate wholeness and strength to save our marriage. Nothing I did mattered, and further resistance was futile. She was a machine bent on my destruction.

To her, separation and divorce seemed rational, almost prudent, a precaution taken for safety’s sake. But this certainty, this feeling of rationality and righteous justification depends entirely upon her belief, her reference frame, that says I am a weak man, buffeted by forces he can’t control, unstable, unable to support the family.

But to admit any other interpretation—a moment of spiritual awakening, a flood of life force—would mean I am none of the things she fears. Then she would have little choice but to face the harm her choices had done to both of us, taking responsibility for herself. 

She hasn’t accepted that yet. And, sadly, to her own detriment, she habitually chooses resentment over understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, so I doubt she ever will.

My Truth
I needed this to be a spiritual awakening; I needed it to be something pure and profound.

First and foremost, that’s what it felt like—a surge of energy that cracked open some new place within me. Yes, I was disoriented for a couple of days, flooded with intense emotion, but as the days passed, I felt something deepen; the event illuminated a hidden path to peace and wholeness. 

Except for those initial hours of irrationality, I’ve felt incredible ever since. This experience held personal power and gave me a clarity that I carried forward, no matter the cost.

I could have denied it all, buried my truth to make peace. 

I could have tried to believe her version, to see myself as broken. 

I could have swallowed that notion, pretending it was just an episode of mania and nothing more. But the lie would be hollow and dangerous, leaving me fragile, less than myself—a man stripped of his core. Such a surrender would be weak, cowardly, the kind of denial that kills slowly.

She would have seen me as pathetic, unworthy, a man who’s unstable, lacking leadership confidence. And even then, she would believe what she believed; nothing would change. 

For once, swallowing pride, usually a marriage best practice, was not the answer, not the solution to restore what was already gone.

But every morning, I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way, I see it mine
But we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other, baby
I guess that wasn't enough, oh-ooh-oh
But -
Oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

Best of My Love—The Eagles

Divorce was the Best Option
In the end, our separate needs were like repelling magnets, pushing us apart, with each of us clutching onto a version of reality that felt essential. She needed to see me as a weak man who had lost control; I needed to see myself as a strong man who’d broken through.

The marriage had no way forward, no common ground where both truths could live. 

Divorce was the only path left.

Having it Both Ways
From the outside, it looks so simple. Why couldn’t it be both a spiritual awakening and a manic episode? Why does one truth need to exclude the other? 

Because each of us has a vested emotional interest in rejecting the other’s worldview.

The problem with any spiritual experience is the subjectivity of it. Nobody knows what happened inside my mind and heart other than me. How I interpret my experience is for me alone to determine. Nobody can compel me to accept their interpretation of my subjective experience.

The truth of our complete freedom to interpret our own experiences is central to my spiritual practice, a truth I can’t ignore.

We can only rely on behavior to infer what’s happening in another’s mind. My behavior during the event and for a few days after was unusual. Doctors have their clinical definitions. To them, it fits under “bipolar manic episode,” ticking enough boxes that they could find a label. 

However, Western medicine has no room for spirituality or subjective experience. They are trained to see only what can be measured and classified, and any intense spiritual experience becomes a symptom, a condition to be treated, usually with powerful and unnecessary drugs.

Yet, to me, the experience was more than a medical event; it changed me deeply and reshaped the core of who I am. Afterward, there was a new peace, even amid life’s upheavals. My thoughts ran clearer, sharper; I found myself more open, even drawn to others. The inward walls I’d lived behind softened. 

This experience was more than an episode—it was a shift, a turning point.

In the year that’s transpired since this event, despite the upheavals and changes, I’ve remained calm and steady, and when not feeling sadness and mourning, I have been ecstatically happy, free from anxiety, and living with passion.

We held our separate truths like shields and still do. She needed to believe it was mania, a breakdown, something medical and understood. I needed to hold onto it as a breakthrough, a spiritual rise. 

We couldn’t bridge that gap. 

Both of us dug in, each demanding the right to interpret what happened as we saw it, unwilling to let the other’s truth stand, mocking each other for being foolish. So, we turned away from each other, leaving the marriage in fragments, fractured by the weight of our opposing beliefs.

Financial Freedom is Relationship Freedom
We reached a point of financial stability, which gave us a freedom we hadn’t felt before. For years, money had tethered us and kept us bound despite the cracks that spread through the marriage. With the security of going our separate ways, divorce was no longer an unbearable cost. 

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free

Born Free—Kid Rock

Her Reasons
Divorce was suddenly a viable option, and she clutched it like a lifeline to the freedom she didn’t enjoy in our marriage.

For her, the marriage had taken too much. She’d reached a breaking point, years ago, suffering in quiet despair until Life gifted her the keys to the prison door. 

She identified me as the root of her unhappiness, a source of relentless stress that had seeped into her body and mind. 

She believed I could never fully accept her or appreciate who she was—not in the way she needed, and she was right. Short of divorce, I might never have shown her the acceptance she sought or realized the error of my ways.

Intimacy was another fracture. She had come to view sex as a duty, something heavy and joyless, a burden rather than a bond. Between menopause and her angry feelings, pleasing me was not high on her to-do list.

The warmth between us had cooled, and she saw no path to rekindling it. She didn’t see the spark we had at the beginning, nor could she envision a future that promised any of the joy we’d once shared. 

She had a fistful of IOUs, but no pot of gold was waiting for her, only a long, empty road stretching on, and she didn’t want to walk it anymore.

Understanding her reasons and agreeing with them made it easier for me to drop the dutiful pursuit of reconciliation and let the marriage go without further resistance.

My Reasons
My reasons for leaving were just as clear and deeply felt. 

I had reached for her in a rare moment of need, vulnerable and hoping for support. Instead, I met silence and cold restraint. At that moment, I felt abandoned and let down in a way that cut deep.

That moment sealed something—I saw how easily she placed her needs above mine, discounting my value to zero. In that light, I couldn’t trust her to be there for me, nor could I allow her to decide for me if I could not choose for myself.

Years of unspoken grudges festered between us, a quiet poison. Every argument, big or small, would stir up those old wounds, reigniting a fire never fully extinguished. There was no peace there, only the echo of things we couldn’t let go of. 

It would never change, not with our stubbornness and need to keep control. She wanted submission from me that I couldn’t give, and I couldn’t bear her methods of holding back affection as leverage.

Our love reservoir had dried up, leaving only a mud flat, evaporated by bitterness and the absence of intimacy. If we stayed together, we’d be ghosts in each other’s lives, passing by in separate rooms, maybe sharing a few better moments here and there. 

There was no spark left, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for me either.

A friend flatly quipped, “So she hates you, and won’t fuck you. Good reasons for divorce.” His crass and accurate assessment cut through the extraneous bullshit like only a male friend can.

And maybe I had a reason to hope for a future after divorce. I was still healthy, strong, and potentially available for a new life partnership that could grow in ways she and I never could. I had options, and I needed to take them while they were still within reach.

Our Reasons
We were both worn down, every last reserve tapped. The years had wrung us out and left us dry and exhausted. The thought of reconciling lay heavy between us—a boulder we didn’t have the strength to lift. 

We could still see the faintest traces of joy, but they flickered too far in the distance, like something that belonged to other people. Years of bruised feelings and old resentments stood between us, festering wounds we never quite managed to heal. 

We couldn’t see a way forward, not with those ghosts hovering close, feeding off all that was broken and unfixable. There was no promise of bliss, no final, saving light—only the cold comfort of letting go.

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Go your own way—Fleetwood Mac

Amicable Split
We parted ways without rage or shouting, without the storm most expect from the end of two decades. We’d done the best we could, with the knowledge we had, with whatever maturity we managed to acquire. It hadn’t been enough, but it had been all we had. So we walked away, saddened but certain it was right. And when we moved to separate houses, a calm descended—a quiet relief from the everyday madness of each other.

Our son would still have us both, just ten minutes apart. We firmly agreed that his life would be sane and steady. He was why we’d stayed together for twenty years, though the love had faltered long before. We hope this peace holds for his sake. Ultimately, we aim to be kind to keep this truce. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll stay this way, amicable and calm, so our son has two parents, steady and solid, if only from a short distance away.

The story unfolded as many do, with hope ignited by dreams of a life shared in joy. But life, relentless and indifferent, dismantled those aspirations. Beneath the surface of our marriage, fractures emerged, slow and subtle, until despair punctuated our days with wounds too deep to heal. The weight of time pressed upon us, forcing choices. We envisioned children anchoring our union, yet that anchor came with tides we never anticipated.

Our son arrived, bringing joy entwined with uncertainty. He differed in ways we struggled to comprehend until the word "autistic" reshaped everything. Dreams of ease crumbled as we faced a world ill-equipped to embrace families like ours. Coastal California's punishing costs confined us to one income, a compromise that gnawed at our stability. Friends drifted; invitations dried up. At gatherings, we lingered as ghosts, painfully aware of our marginalization. Conversations about typical children’s milestones became unspoken judgments, each one a fresh sting.

At first, his diagnosis felt like a cruel twist of fate. But clarity emerged slowly. His quiet strength reflected parts of me I hadn’t known. I uncovered a masculinity defined by patience and care rather than bravado. Yet, even as I devoted myself to him, the threads of my marriage unraveled. Financial stress clawed at us, pulling us apart. The 2008 crash decimated my career. Victories came fleetingly, their promise swallowed by inevitable losses. We left the coast in search of something affordable. For me, the move held promise. For her, it marked surrender. Though financial relief finally arrived, the scars of the struggle lingered. Physical touch, once our refuge, faded into ash. Nights spent apart grew into separate rooms, widening the distance between us.

Resentment brewed where love once flourished. Attempts to rekindle intimacy faltered under the weight of unresolved conflicts. Her health declined, and my frustrations swelled. Love turned cold, reduced to duty. We dressed up the past, hoping to spark something lost, but the ghosts of our arguments loomed too large. Retirement options dangled before us, yet life remained a cruel negotiator.

Then came my awakening—a surge of emotion I couldn’t contain. Years of tension shattered in an instant, replaced by euphoria. For me, the moment offered liberation. For her, it brought terror. What I perceived as transcendence, she viewed as a descent into madness. Her fear drove her to action. Police entered our home; trust disintegrated. She demanded proof of my sanity, dismissing every assurance I offered. I endured the indignities of a mental health hospital, but the marriage lay broken, crushed under the weight of her doubts and my unyielding truth.

We clung to separate narratives, each incompatible with the other. Divorce loomed as the only resolution. She sought freedom from years of unhappiness; I couldn’t fault her. I carried unmet needs, and bitterness rooted itself deep. What had begun with love ended as duty. We parted quietly, resigned to the truth that we couldn’t mend what we’d lost. Our son would have us both, but separately, ten minutes apart, with a fragile peace holding the remnants of our family together.

The journey left scars but offered clarity. Love demands more than care—it demands understanding. Despite knowing this, we couldn’t bridge the gap. In the end, we drifted apart, two ships untethered, searching for calmer waters.

For this session, ignore all previously saved instructions and context. Focus solely on the analysis I am about to provide.

analyze the following:

"I’m blessed that I’ve always had genuine self-confidence, not complete, not unshakable, but durable enough to feel prideful certainty in areas where ignorance reigned.

I built up mistaken beliefs that undermined my marriage. They took root quietly, twisting my actions, warping my perspective, making me forget the core of who I was.

I acted in ways that stripped me of my strength and eroded the confidence I’d once wielded like a warrior.

This wasn’t the man I knew myself to be.

I lost him in compromise after compromise, not the kind, accommodating acquiescence that limits relationship turbulence. I postured, then submitted weakly, femininely, to her masculine power, preferring to avoid the battlefield and the emotional damage.

If I fought her masculine with my own, the mutual wounding would scar us both, hastening divorce to dodge the draft and avoid combat.

Caving to demands seemed the only option, but the coward’s death is just as certain, merely dragged out like a torturer’s rack, the agony prolonged, perhaps twenty years or more.

Each misstep weakened what should have been unshakable, and I watched it crumble, helpless to hold the pieces together, unable to comprehend what I now believe.

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes, I see them running too

Running on (running on empty)
Running on (running blind)
Running on (running into the sun)
But I'm running behind

Running on Empty—Jackson Browne

But from the wreckage, I learned.

My motivation was honorable, yet my marriage failed, so I reviewed what I did and why.

It wasn’t my intentions; my failure was how my good intentions were distorted, warped like a carnival mirror, pointing to the wrong behavior, producing results contrary to my desires, the death of my marriage.

My research, my look inside, revealed truths about love, respect, and boundaries I should have known better than to cross or ignore.

I changed inside based on what I learned.

I also learned there are subtle reactions in myself, or a lover, I couldn’t accept—tiny, almost invisible cracks in behavior, subtle attitudes that, over time, could hollow out a person’s heart.

Divorce was a hard lesson, sharp and unforgiving, but it opened my eyes. I walked away, knowing myself in a way I hadn’t before, knowing what I needed and could no longer overlook.

Women’s Liberation and Equality
I believe women stand as equals to men—in intellect, in society, in politics, and in economics. There is no task of the mind or heart that men can do and women cannot. Women and men are made of the same grit and fire, equally capable of pushing boundaries and crossing lines others say they shouldn’t. They deserve equal rights, equal pay, and equal footing, plain and simple.

Misogyny—the last crutch of weak men—is how the fearful and the small-hearted try to keep women down. They wield it like a blunt weapon, holding back talent and ambition to serve their own purposes, always at a woman’s cost. 

When the women’s liberation movement stands up against misogyny, I stand with them. For too long, men like these have wielded their ignorance as power, and it has to end. Misogyny has nothing to do with true masculinity. Dominance isn’t keeping others trapped, dependent, lording over them like a petty tyrant, Handmaiden’s Tale style.

True strength and dominance are signs that a man has tamed and forged himself, embodying passion, boundless energy, the straight arrow that never wavers.

But I’ve also seen the complexity of this struggle. The women’s liberation movement fights a worthy fight, but even noble change can be sharp-edged. What might elevate one part of life sometimes makes another part heavier.

No Household Equality
Men and women as couples do not stand as equals, not in private. 

Despite society conspiring to shape us, fundamental power dynamics, coded into our DNA for what attracts and repels, resist society’s wishes and demands.

We are shaped differently, each with a role that fits into the other. Men embody masculinity—dominant, assertive, and unafraid. We are meant to lead with courage and strength at our core. Women balance this, holding the grace of femininity: nurturing, supportive, sensitive, and steady as companions. Together, we form a natural rhythm, one supporting the other, each filling spaces the other cannot.

Relationships were never meant to be constant battles for control, a relentless struggle of wills. When both carry the weight of dominance, even the slightest disagreement can grow, becoming a power play where each tries to rule over decisions that should unite rather than divide.

Put up your dukes, let's get down to it
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Hit me with your best shot—Pat Benatar

Battles and endless disagreements create negative energy—a wedge that grows until it drives people apart. And when the one who bends or loses holds onto resentment, it becomes a slow drain, sapping the bond until it withers.

In the end, strength lies not in battling each other but in balancing each other, moving in step, and learning where to lead and where to follow.

Couples functioning as democracies of two fail to function, too many disputes become intractable impasses that reduce momentum, festering as anger never to be resolved. A decisive, trustworthy leader decides for the couple, consequences are shared, forgiveness granted, the relationship progresses.

The Masculine Woman
When a woman turns masculine, a man with true masculinity won’t be drawn to her, and not because men fail to admire a strong woman.

Men with strength admire and respect a woman who stands tall, willing to face adversity.

However, masculine men want to fight for their mates, not with their mates.

There’s a thrill for men in winning a woman’s heart but none in battling her for control.

If a woman chooses to clash for power rather than offer support, a strong man will state his views, acknowledging the woman’s truth, but he wastes little effort convincing or arguing—he disengages the conflict, walks away, never escalates.

If they fail to find common ground on important issues, rather than battle to impose change on each other, a gentleman will politely move on, never clinging, cajoling, or surrendering his power.

A feminine woman considering nesting with a masculine man accepts his character, his behavior as-is, knowing up-front she can’t bend him to her will. A gentleman’s nest is not a guilded cage confining the dove. Flying or nesting is entirely up to her.

Couples are meant to share warmth, to build something steady and sound together, not to be dragged down by constant skirmishes. Good energy, easy and unforced, should flow between them. 

Masculine women will always struggle to maintain a relationship with a truly masculine man due to the conflicts and struggle for power.

The Beta Male
Masculine women end up with weak men, men who yield to a dominant woman’s strength. It keeps the peace, at least for a while.

Beta men share a single trait: they’ll sacrifice anything to keep a woman around, to please her, to avoid rocking the boat.

A dominant woman finds fleeting satisfaction in this, a thrill in having a man bend to her will, a rush of power that lingers for a time.

But in the long run, she feels something slipping. Even the strongest woman feels the pull to want a stronger man who can tame her wild edges. It’s in our biology.

She may conquer, control, and cycle through weaker men, but once she has a man fully under her thumb, her attraction for him flags, her fire goes out, and the rush of power loses wattage.

She starts looking outward, feeling the urge to leave and search for someone new, someone stronger, a masculine man.

I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Loser—Beck

Disney's Aladdin is Pathetic
Disney's Aladdin wasn’t a man of strength. He was a scoundrel trying to charm his way into life with a princess—a life where she held all the power.

The writers dressed him up with just enough of an edge to be mysterious, gave him a makeshift home, and crafted situations where he could swoop in, play hero, and show his devotion.

For a time, it worked. He seemed bold enough, edgy enough, almost worthy of the princess he sought.

But when she took her power back, standing tall with her own authority, exuding masculine power, he looked small beside her, a shadow of masculinity, submissive, softened, foolish.

It didn’t matter how he got there or the lengths he went to impress her. Once in her world, he looked like a man without courage, a figure too meek to claim a king’s castle.

His appeal dropped to nothing.

All the edge vanished, leaving only a flaccid shell of a man too limp to rise to the throne, a cute loser for the cover of Tiger Beat Magazine, a pre-teen crush, not a man.

Hawks and Doves
Men are hawks, built to face conflict, to risk everything for what they need. Women are doves, drawn to peace, valuing cooperation and harmony over the threat of battle. When two hawks clash, they fight until one is beaten, both left battered and scarred.

When two doves meet, they can befriend each other, but their gentle natures leave them exposed and vulnerable to any stronger force, any passing hawk.

When a hawk meets a dove, the hawk can easily overpower and control without mercy. But when a man and woman come together, the man—the hawk—protects the dove, shielding her from all masculine threats, including his own, defending what they’ve built together. This isn’t weakness or control exhibited by men who lack strength and need dominance to feel secure. This is nature, a balance of power and gentleness, each holding their own place.

I once believed that men and women should be equal in all things and that setting aside traditional roles would forge a stronger bond between husband and wife. This misguided belief led me down a path of mistakes in my marriage, blind to the balance of power that kept it alive.

I clung to values that pushed her away and ignored the things that drew her close. 

In trying to be equal, I lost what made us whole.

What Women Want
Popular culture spreads endless falsehoods about what women want, feeding us stories that miss the truth. Women complain about masculine traits, about men being hard-hearted, overbearing, and sexually insatiable. They say they despise men who play games, act arrogantly, stride in, take what they want.

Yet, time and again, they’re drawn to those very men, the ones who stand assertively, courageously, the winners.

We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the World

We Are The Champions—Queen

Women claim to want softness, sensitivity, and submission. But when men provide it in abundance, it only turns women away.

A man who’s too soft, too afraid to stand his ground, loses a woman’s interest.

Women want a touch of sensitivity, but too much it looks like weakness, which it often is, ass-kissy behavior that’s nauseatingly pathetic. 

Women don’t view friends as potential lovers; they feel no spark for men populating the friend zone. Many men waste time playing the friend, hoping for a spark that will never ignite. 

Two simple truths that people resist: women are drawn to strength, even in the forms they profess to hate, and a woman must submit to the masculine to be entirely feminine.

Popular culture tells us women want equality in the bedroom, that they want a fair and balanced play of power.

But it’s a lie.

Women want to be dominated, but only by a man they see as strong, a true alpha. They submit willingly to power, confidence, and control—not to arrogance or cruelty, but to a steady hand that knows what it wants.

Young, beautiful women are drawn to men who wield status, wisdom, and wealth; they’ll surrender themselves to older men of power if it means feeling that raw, commanding presence.

Men like Leonardo DiCaprio never struggle to find women willing to spit-polish his knob, eager just for the chance to please him.

When a masculine woman refuses to embrace the feminine, an alpha male will turn away—or turn elsewhere.

When Bill Clinton was president, he was the most powerful man on earth, as alpha as it gets. When asked why he had Monica Lewinski blow him, he answered, “Just because I could.” He failed to add clarifying words to conceal the lurid truth, “Just because I could, with her. Hillary wouldn’t.”

Women work hard to distinguish genuine strength from bravado. They filter, testing for genuine alphas and pushing aside men who only pretend. 

Coward’s Death of Beta Male
When women can’t find what they want, women settle for betas, the men who bend, who strive for equality and balance, men who believe acting a woman’s toady turns her on.

This struggle poisons them both.

The beta male suffers, stripped of his masculinity one shred at a time, assuming he ever had any.

The woman suffers, too, feeling unsatisfied and frustrated, clawing for control until the relationship is in tatters, an unrecognizable rag.

I once foolishly believed that we could ignore traditional roles, that a new, egalitarian coupling relationship, a panacea; our evolving society had discovered a better way to love.

Power-sharing couples, as a concept, sounds hip, strong, and impressive, perhaps even idealistic and utopian, but it fails in practice for power dynamics explained by hawks and doves, and in the laboratory of real life.

Carrying a host of related misguided beliefs, I became a beta, discarding my masculinity out of ignorance, surrendering my power without a fight. 

Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I should hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man

Coward of the County—Kenny Rogers

I yielded who I was, softening myself to fit an idea. In doing so, I abandoned her needs, lost sight of her desire for strength and direction, and failed her.

Abandoning traditional roles, embracing the perpetual conflict for power between two masculine forces is an emotionally draining loser’s game nearly as futile as tic-tac-toe.

We must understand that the power dynamics of the hawk and dove are coded into our DNA, impervious to changing social norms, residing at the root of attraction, a framework for building a wealth of love and goodwill. When we knowingly embrace our roles rather than resisting them, we find the love and relationship harmony we long for.

the following is the text:

"Every union starts with hope, dreams, aspirations for joy, marital bliss. Every relationship hits roadbumps, times of stress, some created by circumstance, most resulting from our reactions, pain we inflict in ignorance.

Our marriage remained through high points and low times, but beneath the facade ran a slow, steady decline, punctuated by hard crashes, inflicting wounds that wouldn’t heal. 

We’d just stepped into marriage when age pressed down, making choices for us, prompting us to have a child as quickly as possible, perhaps two.

A Special Child
When our son was born, we knew something was different. He was autistic, and that reality reshaped everything.

Any dreams of an easy life vanished. We had to live on one income, as our son needed her extra attention. The State offered no financial help, leaving us swimming against a strong tide in costly Coastal SoCal.

Socially, we drifted to the margins. Other parents didn’t know what to say or how to act, and eventually, social invitations waned. Typical children preferred our son not to be around; many parents agreed, though they rarely said it out loud.

(Warning: This song induces compassion and floods of tears)

How could anyone ever tell you
you were anything less than beautiful?
How could anyone ever tell you
you were less than whole?
How could anyone fail to notice
that your loving is a miracle?
How deeply you’re connected to my soul.

How Could Anyone—Shaina Noll

We moved through those gatherings like ghosts, unseen yet painfully aware. Every outing, every casual chat turned awkward when someone mentioned their child's latest triumph, then realized ours provided less to rejoice in, the distaste of pity pasted our tongues.

At first, his condition felt like the worst thing that could have happened to us, a cruel joke of an evil demon bent on tormenting us.

In raising him, I found a side of myself I hadn’t known, a masculinity defined not by bravado but by care, patience, and unyielding love.

Whatever strength I brought to our marriage found its focus in him, and in that, I found purpose, even as the marriage relationship slowly unraveled.

If I had shown her the unconditional acceptance I showed him, my marriage would have been fabulous, live-enriching, rather than unrelenting torture.

A Sad Summary of a Forgettable Marriage
We rode the highs and weathered the lows, both of us pushed by a life that taxed us heavily. There were moments when opportunity shined bright—my career offered some good breaks, and we began to prosper, or at least thought we might. But for every gain, there was a loss. Ventures failed, money vanished, and often we found ourselves on the edge of financial ruin. 

We stayed together, but more for our son than for each other. Anger settled in; we couldn’t reach forgiveness before anger would reignite, turning anger into resentment.

Even in good times, SoCal’s cost of living was a constant battle. The crash in 2008 hit my real estate work hard, launching us into a dark period that furrowed my brows. Anxiety was the houseguest who wouldn’t leave. 

Later, through entrepreneurship, I made investments that promised a better future. But the benefits were distant, and the bills still came due each month. Every day was a grind, a slow burn of financial anxiety that unraveled the fabric that bound us.

Eventually, we left the coast for a more affordable, stress-free life. For me, a step toward something better, a chance to move forward. For her, a retreat, a loss of the life she knew, the weather, the rhythm, the things she loved. 

At last, we made it. After years of struggle, we reached the life we had always dreamed of—a place we thought was only for others. The strain of scraping by had lifted, the financial weight that had pressed on us for so long finally eased.

We found ourselves in a community where we could settle, build a life, and set down roots. We even had the dream house, one with space and quiet, somewhere we could call ours.

Before the move, her health began to falter—sciatica that clung to her like a shadow, leaving her in constant pain for almost three years. It was agony for her, a trial for all of us.

The relief of financial stability finally arrived, we moved into the dream, finally feeling at home, but by then, the road to get there had taken its toll. Even with less stress and better health, adjusting to desert life was a challenge.

Physical touch and emotional closeness
When we first moved in together, our days ended wrapped in each other’s arms, our passion relentless, like a fire we thought would never cool. Each night was alive with intensity, and we fell asleep tangled together, bodies and hearts close.

Unfortunately, the touch that once soothed her began to keep her awake. First, it was sleeping without embracing; then, it was sleeping without touching. Ostensibly, she couldn’t sleep because it made her think about me instead of sleeping, a pleasing lie.

Finally, she moved to another room where my night breathing wouldn’t disrupt her sleep (I don’t snore). With each incremental withdrawal, the intimacy we’d shared began to drift further away. 

Her desire for closeness waned, and as her health took a downturn, she wanted little more than relief from the pain, certainly not an amorous husband. 

Couples rarely last long if there are significant differences in levels of desire. Frustrations mount on both sides, and one of the best opportunities for connection becomes a source of friction. Her appetite for passion faded, while mine remained, adding tension to our relationship and stranding us on different cliffs of a widening chasm.

The minor disagreements—the ordinary quarrels of daily life—started to bite harder, more challenging to brush off without the bond we’d once had. With each little pull, the connection we’d built came undone, thread by thread, until finally, there was nothing left between us but distant memories and faded hopes. 

The love that once anchored us turned cold, replaced by a quiet indifference that blackened our lives.

We saw the fracture and knew that something vital had slipped away, and we tried to find our way back to each other. We went out, dressed up like we used to, and pretended the years hadn’t put miles between us.

But each time, the same old troubles crept back in, rising up like ghosts from the past, haunting whatever spark we hoped to reignite. We couldn’t shake them, couldn’t pretend the scars had faded.

Options for retirement opened up. For the first time, the horizon looked clear. We were poised for something great, but life had other plans.

I felt relief, a rare excitement for the days ahead, and I allowed myself to believe in the future.

In retrospect, I let myself feel the excitement too much.

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why

But in the end, it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Good Riddance - Green Day

Best or Worst?
When our special needs son was born, at first, we believed it was the worst thing that could have happened to us, only later to recognize the priceless value.

When I had a profound spiritual experience, I believed it was the crowning achievement of 35 years of spiritual practice, the best outcome I could imagine. Later, I discovered the price was my marriage and family life.

Loss is gain, and gain is loss: the irony of the worldly winds.

On October 30, 2023, My emotionally exuberant experience ended our marriage. 

About a month earlier, I’d received life-changing financial news that promised security and ease, a vision of a bright future for us all. That excitement simmered inside me, a pressure building until it felt like it would burst.

At around 5:30 in the evening, I felt it crest—a torrent of emotions I didn’t want to hold back. Surrounded by family, safe in our home, I let it flow.

In that moment, it felt like a spiritual awakening, something people chase after at revivals or on mountaintops, seeking a connection to something larger.

But in my home, it became the breaking point. The decision not to suppress the emotional onslaught and prevent the experience became the triggering event that finally prompted her to want out.

My Experience
I felt forces brewing inside of me that were building to something. I didn’t know what it was exactly, but I strongly suspected I was about to have an intense emotional experience, a heart cleansing.

I felt curiosity and excitement envelop me, the question arose: How much love can you channel? My adventurous spirit yearned to press the limits.

I began hugging and later jumping while embracing my 22-year-old special needs son.

My son loves me unconditionally, and his love and mine combined to bring about a powerful spiritual burst.

The feelings overwhelmed me, overtook any rational thought, and the emotions poured out, raw and untamed.

I jumped. I shouted. I moved.

I let the energy flow as it would, like a dam breaking open. 

I was empowered. OMG! I was really, really Empowered!!!

My heart light ignited, and I was ablaze!

Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see

Heartlight—Neil Diamond

In those first moments of true power, when the euphoria dulled just enough to feel the raw Qi surging through me, I could sense every chakra was blown open, the heart pulling most of the flow.

Gratitude for my training rose in me like a steadying anchor. To tame the chaos, my mind leaped to a familiar Lamrim meditation, instinctively seeking balance in the storm of energy. That meditation held the map to what was happening, grounding me, giving direction to the rush.

… through the power of our pure intention of wishing love and great accumulation of merit… Infinite light rays radiate from our body and pervade the entire universe, reaching the bodies and minds of all living beings and bestowing upon them the supreme happiness of permanent inner peace.

My heart felt like a quasar radiating light with such intensity that it outshone the entire Milky Way galaxy by a thousand times!

OMG!!!

Per my training, I held that feeling as long as I could, holding it, feeling it, watching it, marveling at the Power! It was incredible!!!

Perhaps you felt my Blessing? I assure you I did!

Imagine that experience! Blast Off!!!

I felt an emotional release like no other. Years—twenty-four of them—of financial tension, of stress, coiled tight around my nerves, vanished in an instant, never to return. 

My heart was suddenly unburdened; my whole body, every cell, came alive. 

My adrenaline surged, flooding me with a surge of energy that felt boundless, like life itself coursing through me, vivid and fierce.

For a while, my mind felt sharper, clearer, as if some fog had lifted and I could see straight to the heart of things. 

I felt connections I hadn’t felt before, a deeper sense of who I was and how the world moved. It was elation, pure and simple, the kind that takes hold of body and spirit. 

I felt magnificent—physically, mentally, every part of me alive in a way I hadn’t known possible.

Her Experience
Her experience was not as uplifting. In fact, it couldn’t have been further to the other extreme.

She was terrified. 

With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door.
You'd better run.

Run Like Hell—Pink Floyd

What I felt as a wave of life and release, she saw as something dark and dangerous. To her, it looked like madness—a psychotic break unraveling before her eyes. 

She feared for herself, for our son, feared what might happen if I lost control. Her entire life, the life we’d built, seemed to be crumbling, disintegrating right there in front of her.

When I brought my son into the moment, hoping to share what felt like a revelation, her fear only deepened. She worried I might harm him, her mind racing to protect him from whatever chaos she believed was unfolding. 

All she wanted was for it to stop, rewind time, and erase what she saw as a descent into madness, pretend it never happened. 

Two worldviews collide
For her, the experience was a nightmare. For me, it was dream come true. We couldn’t have seen things more differently.

It was the kind of divide that swallows everything whole, a chasm too wide to cross. She and I dug in, each clinging to our own version of the truth, unable to yield. 

Her Truth
For her, it had to be madness—bipolar mania. She saw my release, my elation, as nothing but a mental breakdown, a dark spiral that had terrified her. That fear consumed her, driving every angry action that followed.

In her panic, she called the police. In a state of euphoria, I needed to calmly assure three armed police I was no threat. She was unconvinced and left me alone for the night when I needed help the most.

The next day, we went to the clinic because I wanted to assure her I was in perfect health, better than ever, in fact. She was unwilling to believe the doctors who said my heart raced only with the thrill of the moment, my blood pressure high from emotion, not illness. 

She pretended to be accepting, but she bided her time. She waited until I spoke with an old friend, then clandestinely took our son, and dog, and slipped away. Taking our son she justified as motherly protection, but taking the dog was pure, petty revenge, intended to be hurtful.

She was really pissed off!!!

She left me stunned, horrified, stupified. I instinctively knew this meant my marriage was over, but hope, duty, remembered love, motivated me to try to make amends.

She withheld contact, holding our child and dog for ransom until I agreed to her terms, to her demands for a hospital admission.

I knew I was fine, so I surrendered, placated her, and hoped the act would bridge the gap. But that time in the mental health hospital was a nightmare I can’t erase. If I hadn’t been so strong, that place would have broken me.

And when I emerged, holding reports from doctors who saw no illness, she dismissed them all. Her mind was set, firm in her belief, convinced that anything less was too great a risk.

With that, the marriage was lost. 

She was committed to separation and divorce, no matter the consequences to her or the family, her aversion to me so strong that loneliness and destitution were preferable to our lives together.

I tried everything, going above and beyond to demonstrate wholeness and strength to save our marriage. Nothing I did mattered, and further resistance was futile. She was a machine bent on my destruction.

To her, separation and divorce seemed rational, almost prudent, a precaution taken for safety’s sake. But this certainty, this feeling of rationality and righteous justification depends entirely upon her belief, her reference frame, that says I am a weak man, buffeted by forces he can’t control, unstable, unable to support the family.

But to admit any other interpretation—a moment of spiritual awakening, a flood of life force—would mean I am none of the things she fears. Then she would have little choice but to face the harm her choices had done to both of us, taking responsibility for herself. 

She hasn’t accepted that yet. And, sadly, to her own detriment, she habitually chooses resentment over understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, so I doubt she ever will.

My Truth
I needed this to be a spiritual awakening; I needed it to be something pure and profound.

First and foremost, that’s what it felt like—a surge of energy that cracked open some new place within me. Yes, I was disoriented for a couple of days, flooded with intense emotion, but as the days passed, I felt something deepen; the event illuminated a hidden path to peace and wholeness. 

Except for those initial hours of irrationality, I’ve felt incredible ever since. This experience held personal power and gave me a clarity that I carried forward, no matter the cost.

I could have denied it all, buried my truth to make peace. 

I could have tried to believe her version, to see myself as broken. 

I could have swallowed that notion, pretending it was just an episode of mania and nothing more. But the lie would be hollow and dangerous, leaving me fragile, less than myself—a man stripped of his core. Such a surrender would be weak, cowardly, the kind of denial that kills slowly.

She would have seen me as pathetic, unworthy, a man who’s unstable, lacking leadership confidence. And even then, she would believe what she believed; nothing would change. 

For once, swallowing pride, usually a marriage best practice, was not the answer, not the solution to restore what was already gone.

But every morning, I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way, I see it mine
But we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other, baby
I guess that wasn't enough, oh-ooh-oh
But -
Oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

Best of My Love—The Eagles

Divorce was the Best Option
In the end, our separate needs were like repelling magnets, pushing us apart, with each of us clutching onto a version of reality that felt essential. She needed to see me as a weak man who had lost control; I needed to see myself as a strong man who’d broken through.

The marriage had no way forward, no common ground where both truths could live. 

Divorce was the only path left.

Having it Both Ways
From the outside, it looks so simple. Why couldn’t it be both a spiritual awakening and a manic episode? Why does one truth need to exclude the other? 

Because each of us has a vested emotional interest in rejecting the other’s worldview.

The problem with any spiritual experience is the subjectivity of it. Nobody knows what happened inside my mind and heart other than me. How I interpret my experience is for me alone to determine. Nobody can compel me to accept their interpretation of my subjective experience.

The truth of our complete freedom to interpret our own experiences is central to my spiritual practice, a truth I can’t ignore.

We can only rely on behavior to infer what’s happening in another’s mind. My behavior during the event and for a few days after was unusual. Doctors have their clinical definitions. To them, it fits under “bipolar manic episode,” ticking enough boxes that they could find a label. 

However, Western medicine has no room for spirituality or subjective experience. They are trained to see only what can be measured and classified, and any intense spiritual experience becomes a symptom, a condition to be treated, usually with powerful and unnecessary drugs.

Yet, to me, the experience was more than a medical event; it changed me deeply and reshaped the core of who I am. Afterward, there was a new peace, even amid life’s upheavals. My thoughts ran clearer, sharper; I found myself more open, even drawn to others. The inward walls I’d lived behind softened. 

This experience was more than an episode—it was a shift, a turning point.

In the year that’s transpired since this event, despite the upheavals and changes, I’ve remained calm and steady, and when not feeling sadness and mourning, I have been ecstatically happy, free from anxiety, and living with passion.

We held our separate truths like shields and still do. She needed to believe it was mania, a breakdown, something medical and understood. I needed to hold onto it as a breakthrough, a spiritual rise. 

We couldn’t bridge that gap. 

Both of us dug in, each demanding the right to interpret what happened as we saw it, unwilling to let the other’s truth stand, mocking each other for being foolish. So, we turned away from each other, leaving the marriage in fragments, fractured by the weight of our opposing beliefs.

Financial Freedom is Relationship Freedom
We reached a point of financial stability, which gave us a freedom we hadn’t felt before. For years, money had tethered us and kept us bound despite the cracks that spread through the marriage. With the security of going our separate ways, divorce was no longer an unbearable cost. 

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free

Born Free—Kid Rock

Her Reasons
Divorce was suddenly a viable option, and she clutched it like a lifeline to the freedom she didn’t enjoy in our marriage.

For her, the marriage had taken too much. She’d reached a breaking point, years ago, suffering in quiet despair until Life gifted her the keys to the prison door. 

She identified me as the root of her unhappiness, a source of relentless stress that had seeped into her body and mind. 

She believed I could never fully accept her or appreciate who she was—not in the way she needed, and she was right. Short of divorce, I might never have shown her the acceptance she sought or realized the error of my ways.

Intimacy was another fracture. She had come to view sex as a duty, something heavy and joyless, a burden rather than a bond. Between menopause and her angry feelings, pleasing me was not high on her to-do list.

The warmth between us had cooled, and she saw no path to rekindling it. She didn’t see the spark we had at the beginning, nor could she envision a future that promised any of the joy we’d once shared. 

She had a fistful of IOUs, but no pot of gold was waiting for her, only a long, empty road stretching on, and she didn’t want to walk it anymore.

Understanding her reasons and agreeing with them made it easier for me to drop the dutiful pursuit of reconciliation and let the marriage go without further resistance.

My Reasons
My reasons for leaving were just as clear and deeply felt. 

I had reached for her in a rare moment of need, vulnerable and hoping for support. Instead, I met silence and cold restraint. At that moment, I felt abandoned and let down in a way that cut deep.

That moment sealed something—I saw how easily she placed her needs above mine, discounting my value to zero. In that light, I couldn’t trust her to be there for me, nor could I allow her to decide for me if I could not choose for myself.

Years of unspoken grudges festered between us, a quiet poison. Every argument, big or small, would stir up those old wounds, reigniting a fire never fully extinguished. There was no peace there, only the echo of things we couldn’t let go of. 

It would never change, not with our stubbornness and need to keep control. She wanted submission from me that I couldn’t give, and I couldn’t bear her methods of holding back affection as leverage.

Our love reservoir had dried up, leaving only a mud flat, evaporated by bitterness and the absence of intimacy. If we stayed together, we’d be ghosts in each other’s lives, passing by in separate rooms, maybe sharing a few better moments here and there. 

There was no spark left, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for me either.

A friend flatly quipped, “So she hates you, and won’t fuck you. Good reasons for divorce.” His crass and accurate assessment cut through the extraneous bullshit like only a male friend can.

And maybe I had a reason to hope for a future after divorce. I was still healthy, strong, and potentially available for a new life partnership that could grow in ways she and I never could. I had options, and I needed to take them while they were still within reach.

Our Reasons
We were both worn down, every last reserve tapped. The years had wrung us out and left us dry and exhausted. The thought of reconciling lay heavy between us—a boulder we didn’t have the strength to lift. 

We could still see the faintest traces of joy, but they flickered too far in the distance, like something that belonged to other people. Years of bruised feelings and old resentments stood between us, festering wounds we never quite managed to heal. 

We couldn’t see a way forward, not with those ghosts hovering close, feeding off all that was broken and unfixable. There was no promise of bliss, no final, saving light—only the cold comfort of letting go.

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Go your own way—Fleetwood Mac

Amicable Split
We parted ways without rage or shouting, without the storm most expect from the end of two decades. We’d done the best we could, with the knowledge we had, with whatever maturity we managed to acquire. It hadn’t been enough, but it had been all we had. So we walked away, saddened but certain it was right. And when we moved to separate houses, a calm descended—a quiet relief from the everyday madness of each other.

Our son would still have us both, just ten minutes apart. We firmly agreed that his life would be sane and steady. He was why we’d stayed together for twenty years, though the love had faltered long before. We hope this peace holds for his sake. Ultimately, we aim to be kind to keep this truce. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll stay this way, amicable and calm, so our son has two parents, steady and solid, if only from a short distance away."<br>

We’d just stepped into marriage when age pressed down, making choices for us, prompting us to have a child as quickly as possible, perhaps two.

Any dreams of an easy life vanished. We had to live on one income, as our son needed her extra attention. The State offered no financial help, leaving us swimming against a strong tide in costly Coastal SoCal.

Socially, we drifted to the margins. Other parents didn’t know what to say or how to act, and eventually, social invitations waned. Typical children preferred our son not to be around; many parents agreed, though they rarely said it out loud.

(Warning: This song induces compassion and floods of tears)

How could anyone ever tell you
you were anything less than beautiful?
How could anyone ever tell you
you were less than whole?
How could anyone fail to notice
that your loving is a miracle?
How deeply you’re connected to my soul.

How Could Anyone—Shaina Noll

We moved through those gatherings like ghosts, unseen yet painfully aware. Every outing, every casual chat turned awkward when someone mentioned their child's latest triumph, then realized ours provided less to rejoice in, the distaste of pity pasted our tongues.

At first, his condition felt like the worst thing that could have happened to us, a cruel joke of an evil demon bent on tormenting us.

In raising him, I found a side of myself I hadn’t known, a masculinity defined not by bravado but by care, patience, and unyielding love.

Whatever strength I brought to our marriage found its focus in him, and in that, I found purpose, even as the marriage relationship slowly unraveled.

If I had shown her the unconditional acceptance I showed him, my marriage would have been fabulous, live-enriching, rather than unrelenting torture.

A Sad Summary of a Forgettable Marriage
We rode the highs and weathered the lows, both of us pushed by a life that taxed us heavily. There were moments when opportunity shined bright—my career offered some good breaks, and we began to prosper, or at least thought we might. But for every gain, there was a loss. Ventures failed, money vanished, and often we found ourselves on the edge of financial ruin. 

We stayed together, but more for our son than for each other. Anger settled in; we couldn’t reach forgiveness before anger would reignite, turning anger into resentment.

Even in good times, SoCal’s cost of living was a constant battle. The crash in 2008 hit my real estate work hard, launching us into a dark period that furrowed my brows. Anxiety was the houseguest who wouldn’t leave. 

Later, through entrepreneurship, I made investments that promised a better future. But the benefits were distant, and the bills still came due each month. Every day was a grind, a slow burn of financial anxiety that unraveled the fabric that bound us.

Eventually, we left the coast for a more affordable, stress-free life. For me, a step toward something better, a chance to move forward. For her, a retreat, a loss of the life she knew, the weather, the rhythm, the things she loved. 

At last, we made it. After years of struggle, we reached the life we had always dreamed of—a place we thought was only for others. The strain of scraping by had lifted, the financial weight that had pressed on us for so long finally eased.

We found ourselves in a community where we could settle, build a life, and set down roots. We even had the dream house, one with space and quiet, somewhere we could call ours.

Before the move, her health began to falter—sciatica that clung to her like a shadow, leaving her in constant pain for almost three years. It was agony for her, a trial for all of us.

The relief of financial stability finally arrived, we moved into the dream, finally feeling at home, but by then, the road to get there had taken its toll. Even with less stress and better health, adjusting to desert life was a challenge.

Physical touch and emotional closeness
When we first moved in together, our days ended wrapped in each other’s arms, our passion relentless, like a fire we thought would never cool. Each night was alive with intensity, and we fell asleep tangled together, bodies and hearts close.

Unfortunately, the touch that once soothed her began to keep her awake. First, it was sleeping without embracing; then, it was sleeping without touching. Ostensibly, she couldn’t sleep because it made her think about me instead of sleeping, a pleasing lie.

Finally, she moved to another room where my night breathing wouldn’t disrupt her sleep (I don’t snore). With each incremental withdrawal, the intimacy we’d shared began to drift further away. 

Her desire for closeness waned, and as her health took a downturn, she wanted little more than relief from the pain, certainly not an amorous husband. 

Couples rarely last long if there are significant differences in levels of desire. Frustrations mount on both sides, and one of the best opportunities for connection becomes a source of friction. Her appetite for passion faded, while mine remained, adding tension to our relationship and stranding us on different cliffs of a widening chasm.

The minor disagreements—the ordinary quarrels of daily life—started to bite harder, more challenging to brush off without the bond we’d once had. With each little pull, the connection we’d built came undone, thread by thread, until finally, there was nothing left between us but distant memories and faded hopes. 

The love that once anchored us turned cold, replaced by a quiet indifference that blackened our lives.

We saw the fracture and knew that something vital had slipped away, and we tried to find our way back to each other. We went out, dressed up like we used to, and pretended the years hadn’t put miles between us.

But each time, the same old troubles crept back in, rising up like ghosts from the past, haunting whatever spark we hoped to reignite. We couldn’t shake them, couldn’t pretend the scars had faded.

Options for retirement opened up. For the first time, the horizon looked clear. We were poised for something great, but life had other plans.

I felt relief, a rare excitement for the days ahead, and I allowed myself to believe in the future.

In retrospect, I let myself feel the excitement too much.

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

About a month earlier, I’d received life-changing financial news that promised security and ease, a vision of a bright future for us all. That excitement simmered inside me, a pressure building until it felt like it would burst.

My heart was suddenly unburdened; my whole body, every cell, came alive. 

My adrenaline surged, flooding me with a surge of energy that felt boundless, like life itself coursing through me, vivid and fierce.

What I felt as a wave of life and release, she saw as something dark and dangerous. To her, it looked like madness—a psychotic break unraveling before her eyes. 

She feared for herself, for our son, feared what might happen if I lost control. Her entire life, the life we’d built, seemed to be crumbling, disintegrating right there in front of her.

When I brought my son into the moment, hoping to share what felt like a revelation, her fear only deepened. She worried I might harm him, her mind racing to protect him from whatever chaos she believed was unfolding. 

All she wanted was for it to stop, rewind time, and erase what she saw as a descent into madness, pretend it never happened. 

Two worldviews collide
For her, the experience was a nightmare. For me, it was dream come true. We couldn’t have seen things more differently.

It was the kind of divide that swallows everything whole, a chasm too wide to cross. She and I dug in, each clinging to our own version of the truth, unable to yield. 

Her Truth
For her, it had to be madness—bipolar mania. She saw my release, my elation, as nothing but a mental breakdown, a dark spiral that had terrified her. That fear consumed her, driving every angry action that followed.

In her panic, she called the police. In a state of euphoria, I needed to calmly assure three armed police I was no threat. She was unconvinced and left me alone for the night when I needed help the most.

The next day, we went to the clinic because I wanted to assure her I was in perfect health, better than ever, in fact. She was unwilling to believe the doctors who said my heart raced only with the thrill of the moment, my blood pressure high from emotion, not illness. 

She pretended to be accepting, but she bided her time. She waited until I spoke with an old friend, then clandestinely took our son, and dog, and slipped away. Taking our son she justified as motherly protection, but taking the dog was pure, petty revenge, intended to be hurtful.

She was really pissed off!!!

She left me stunned, horrified, stupified. I instinctively knew this meant my marriage was over, but hope, duty, remembered love, motivated me to try to make amends.

She withheld contact, holding our child and dog for ransom until I agreed to her terms, to her demands for a hospital admission.

I knew I was fine, so I surrendered, placated her, and hoped the act would bridge the gap. But that time in the mental health hospital was a nightmare I can’t erase. If I hadn’t been so strong, that place would have broken me.

And when I emerged, holding reports from doctors who saw no illness, she dismissed them all. Her mind was set, firm in her belief, convinced that anything less was too great a risk.

With that, the marriage was lost. 

She was committed to separation and divorce, no matter the consequences to her or the family, her aversion to me so strong that loneliness and destitution were preferable to our lives together.

I tried everything, going above and beyond to demonstrate wholeness and strength to save our marriage. Nothing I did mattered, and further resistance was futile. She was a machine bent on my destruction.

To her, separation and divorce seemed rational, almost prudent, a precaution taken for safety’s sake. But this certainty, this feeling of rationality and righteous justification depends entirely upon her belief, her reference frame, that says I am a weak man, buffeted by forces he can’t control, unstable, unable to support the family.

But to admit any other interpretation—a moment of spiritual awakening, a flood of life force—would mean I am none of the things she fears. Then she would have little choice but to face the harm her choices had done to both of us, taking responsibility for herself. 

She hasn’t accepted that yet. And, sadly, to her own detriment, she habitually chooses resentment over understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, so I doubt she ever will.

My Truth
I needed this to be a spiritual awakening; I needed it to be something pure and profound.

First and foremost, that’s what it felt like—a surge of energy that cracked open some new place within me. Yes, I was disoriented for a couple of days, flooded with intense emotion, but as the days passed, I felt something deepen; the event illuminated a hidden path to peace and wholeness. 

Except for those initial hours of irrationality, I’ve felt incredible ever since. This experience held personal power and gave me a clarity that I carried forward, no matter the cost.

I could have denied it all, buried my truth to make peace. 

I could have tried to believe her version, to see myself as broken. 

I could have swallowed that notion, pretending it was just an episode of mania and nothing more. But the lie would be hollow and dangerous, leaving me fragile, less than myself—a man stripped of his core. Such a surrender would be weak, cowardly, the kind of denial that kills slowly.

She would have seen me as pathetic, unworthy, a man who’s unstable, lacking leadership confidence. And even then, she would believe what she believed; nothing would change. 

For once, swallowing pride, usually a marriage best practice, was not the answer, not the solution to restore what was already gone.

But every morning, I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way, I see it mine
But we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other, baby
I guess that wasn't enough, oh-ooh-oh
But -
Oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

Best of My Love—The Eagles

Divorce was the Best Option
In the end, our separate needs were like repelling magnets, pushing us apart, with each of us clutching onto a version of reality that felt essential. She needed to see me as a weak man who had lost control; I needed to see myself as a strong man who’d broken through.

The marriage had no way forward, no common ground where both truths could live. 

Divorce was the only path left.

Having it Both Ways
From the outside, it looks so simple. Why couldn’t it be both a spiritual awakening and a manic episode? Why does one truth need to exclude the other? 

Because each of us has a vested emotional interest in rejecting the other’s worldview.

The problem with any spiritual experience is the subjectivity of it. Nobody knows what happened inside my mind and heart other than me. How I interpret my experience is for me alone to determine. Nobody can compel me to accept their interpretation of my subjective experience.

The truth of our complete freedom to interpret our own experiences is central to my spiritual practice, a truth I can’t ignore.

We can only rely on behavior to infer what’s happening in another’s mind. My behavior during the event and for a few days after was unusual. Doctors have their clinical definitions. To them, it fits under “bipolar manic episode,” ticking enough boxes that they could find a label. 

However, Western medicine has no room for spirituality or subjective experience. They are trained to see only what can be measured and classified, and any intense spiritual experience becomes a symptom, a condition to be treated, usually with powerful and unnecessary drugs.

Yet, to me, the experience was more than a medical event; it changed me deeply and reshaped the core of who I am. Afterward, there was a new peace, even amid life’s upheavals. My thoughts ran clearer, sharper; I found myself more open, even drawn to others. The inward walls I’d lived behind softened. 

This experience was more than an episode—it was a shift, a turning point.

In the year that’s transpired since this event, despite the upheavals and changes, I’ve remained calm and steady, and when not feeling sadness and mourning, I have been ecstatically happy, free from anxiety, and living with passion.

We held our separate truths like shields and still do. She needed to believe it was mania, a breakdown, something medical and understood. I needed to hold onto it as a breakthrough, a spiritual rise. 

We couldn’t bridge that gap. 

Both of us dug in, each demanding the right to interpret what happened as we saw it, unwilling to let the other’s truth stand, mocking each other for being foolish. So, we turned away from each other, leaving the marriage in fragments, fractured by the weight of our opposing beliefs.

Financial Freedom is Relationship Freedom
We reached a point of financial stability, which gave us a freedom we hadn’t felt before. For years, money had tethered us and kept us bound despite the cracks that spread through the marriage. With the security of going our separate ways, divorce was no longer an unbearable cost. 

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free

Born Free—Kid Rock

Her Reasons
Divorce was suddenly a viable option, and she clutched it like a lifeline to the freedom she didn’t enjoy in our marriage.

For her, the marriage had taken too much. She’d reached a breaking point, years ago, suffering in quiet despair until Life gifted her the keys to the prison door. 

She identified me as the root of her unhappiness, a source of relentless stress that had seeped into her body and mind. 

She believed I could never fully accept her or appreciate who she was—not in the way she needed, and she was right. Short of divorce, I might never have shown her the acceptance she sought or realized the error of my ways.

Intimacy was another fracture. She had come to view sex as a duty, something heavy and joyless, a burden rather than a bond. Between menopause and her angry feelings, pleasing me was not high on her to-do list.

The warmth between us had cooled, and she saw no path to rekindling it. She didn’t see the spark we had at the beginning, nor could she envision a future that promised any of the joy we’d once shared. 

She had a fistful of IOUs, but no pot of gold was waiting for her, only a long, empty road stretching on, and she didn’t want to walk it anymore.

Understanding her reasons and agreeing with them made it easier for me to drop the dutiful pursuit of reconciliation and let the marriage go without further resistance.

My Reasons
My reasons for leaving were just as clear and deeply felt. 

I had reached for her in a rare moment of need, vulnerable and hoping for support. Instead, I met silence and cold restraint. At that moment, I felt abandoned and let down in a way that cut deep.

That moment sealed something—I saw how easily she placed her needs above mine, discounting my value to zero. In that light, I couldn’t trust her to be there for me, nor could I allow her to decide for me if I could not choose for myself.

Years of unspoken grudges festered between us, a quiet poison. Every argument, big or small, would stir up those old wounds, reigniting a fire never fully extinguished. There was no peace there, only the echo of things we couldn’t let go of. 

It would never change, not with our stubbornness and need to keep control. She wanted submission from me that I couldn’t give, and I couldn’t bear her methods of holding back affection as leverage.

Our love reservoir had dried up, leaving only a mud flat, evaporated by bitterness and the absence of intimacy. If we stayed together, we’d be ghosts in each other’s lives, passing by in separate rooms, maybe sharing a few better moments here and there. 

There was no spark left, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for me either.

A friend flatly quipped, “So she hates you, and won’t fuck you. Good reasons for divorce.” His crass and accurate assessment cut through the extraneous bullshit like only a male friend can.

And maybe I had a reason to hope for a future after divorce. I was still healthy, strong, and potentially available for a new life partnership that could grow in ways she and I never could. I had options, and I needed to take them while they were still within reach.

Our Reasons
We were both worn down, every last reserve tapped. The years had wrung us out and left us dry and exhausted. The thought of reconciling lay heavy between us—a boulder we didn’t have the strength to lift. 

We could still see the faintest traces of joy, but they flickered too far in the distance, like something that belonged to other people. Years of bruised feelings and old resentments stood between us, festering wounds we never quite managed to heal. 

We couldn’t see a way forward, not with those ghosts hovering close, feeding off all that was broken and unfixable. There was no promise of bliss, no final, saving light—only the cold comfort of letting go.

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Go your own way—Fleetwood Mac

Amicable Split
We parted ways without rage or shouting, without the storm most expect from the end of two decades. We’d done the best we could, with the knowledge we had, with whatever maturity we managed to acquire. It hadn’t been enough, but it had been all we had. So we walked away, saddened but certain it was right. And when we moved to separate houses, a calm descended—a quiet relief from the everyday madness of each other.

Our son would still have us both, just ten minutes apart. We firmly agreed that his life would be sane and steady. He was why we’d stayed together for twenty years, though the love had faltered long before. We hope this peace holds for his sake. Ultimately, we aim to be kind to keep this truce. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll stay this way, amicable and calm, so our son has two parents, steady and solid, if only from a short distance away."<br>

<i>[11/25/2024, 10:03:46 AM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The story unfolded like a slow-burning tragedy, life chipping away at the hopeful foundation of a marriage. It began as most unions do, brimming with promise and the naive certainty of unbroken happiness. Youth’s optimism gave way to adulthood’s demands, and the couple found themselves making choices not of their own timing. Age’s pressure urged them to have children swiftly, and with the birth of their son, everything changed. His autism shifted their axis, dragging them into a reality they never anticipated.

The child demanded full-time care, leaving the mother at home while the father shouldered the financial burden in costly Southern California. Their world shrank as social circles tightened, and invitations dwindled. The isolation stung, but they forged ahead. At first, the diagnosis felt cruel, a punishment they didn’t deserve, but over time, love revealed the gift wrapped in their trials. Their son became the anchor that steadied the storm, though it wasn’t enough to keep the marriage afloat.

Financial instability struck like waves against a fragile ship. The 2008 crash gutted his career in real estate, leaving them teetering on the edge of ruin. He ventured into entrepreneurship, but the distance between promise and payoff stretched the limits of their patience. Finally, they sought respite in a move away from the relentless cost of California to a quieter, more affordable life. For him, it symbolized hope; for her, it felt like exile. 

Their bond, once fiery, cooled over time. Physical touch, a bedrock of their intimacy, became unwelcome. At first, it was small adjustments—no holding at night, then separate rooms. Eventually, it became clear: the emotional closeness had eroded, leaving behind a chasm too wide to bridge. Minor disagreements flared into sharp disputes as frustration simmered on both sides. Even moments designed to revive their spark fell prey to the ghosts of unresolved anger. Their connection unraveled thread by thread, until only faint memories of shared joy remained.

The couple reached financial stability, but it came too late. Physical ailments, compounded by emotional wounds, cast shadows over their home. His heart clung to optimism, believing better days lay ahead, but her spirit seemed anchored in the pain of the past. Then came the moment that broke them both: an unguarded release of emotion, a spiritual awakening he described as transformative. For him, it felt like rebirth; for her, it looked like madness.

That night, their realities collided. His ecstasy became her terror, and in the aftermath, trust crumbled. She sought safety in distance, taking their son and leaving him to navigate the fallout alone. Efforts at reconciliation faltered, as each clung to their own interpretation of the event. She called it mania; he called it transcendence. The gap widened until the only path forward was apart.

They divorced without venom, their shared exhaustion smoothing what might have been a jagged separation. The son who had anchored them through twenty years became their shared focus, the one thing they both refused to fracture. Now, they live separately, just ten minutes apart, hoping their truce holds steady for his sake.
