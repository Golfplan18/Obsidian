üëâ - Indicates the current conversation path

<i>[11/25/2024, 10:19:23 AM]</i> üëâ <b>üë§ User</b>: 

For this session, ignore all previously saved instructions and context. Focus solely on the analysis I am about to provide.

Verification
1. Verify that your analysis will only come from the text itself, and you will not synthesized a narrative framework based on general themes and expectations for such a piece rather than directly analyzing the content from the link provided.

Provide sections of your analysis as follows.
1. Chronicle the chronology of events
2. Summarize the main themes of each section and the whole
3. summarize the main points.
4. Compile a list of unique and interesting quotes, including bolded items that were emphasized. do not truncate quotes with ellipses.
5. Trace the emotional journey of the author and provide a list of realizations and a chronology. Show how each realization built upon the others.
6. Provide any general insights typical of similar reviews of literature of this kind.

Output
1. Provide the output as a narrative form, emulating Earnest Hemingway's style, injecting emotive and expressive verbs and descriptions, using first-person singular in most instances or plural when appropriate, removing serial "and" after a comma
2. The author should narrate as if speaking directly to the reader.
2.1. Use "I" instead of "He". The story is told first person.
3. Reduce "be" verbs as much as possible in favor of past tense or present tense verbs with strong action. Unique verbs are preferred.
4. The author should narrate as if speaking directly to the reader.
5. Do not use bold headings. Make the output a continuous narrative.
6. Limit the output to between 400-750 words.
7. Be concise. Be complete. Don't let the word limit cause main points to be dropped.
8. Provide an extensive list of quotes as a separate section at the end.
9. Don't use the italicized music lyrics.

the following is the text:
"Selecting a suitable mate often means investing years in failed relationships to establish a list of criteria: must-haves, wants, can‚Äôt-stands, and rather-nots.

At first, as a man, the must-have is sex, want is looks, aversions, none‚Äîany port in the storm. With each disappointment, we add to our lists of can‚Äôt-stands and rather-nots, the crazies, the wounded, the needy.

As we gain experience with longer-term relationships, our lists become more nuanced and detailed, making it harder to find partners later in life, like having a million streaming shows and nothing to watch.

What I Can‚Äôt Abide
There are the obvious, glaring behaviors no one should stand for, but I found there were other things, subtler flaws, that gnawed at me just as deeply. Ways of handling conflict that left battle damage that wore me down over time. Small traits and irritants I once brushed aside became impossible to ignore. I saw that I couldn't live with specific traits, not in the long run, not if I wanted peace and love in my heart.

Anger the Deflator 
There‚Äôs no building a relationship with someone who doesn‚Äôt control their anger, not if depth is the goal. A real relationship is about amassing a wealth of love, a reservoir of goodwill you can both draw from.

But anger empties that reservoir fast.

Eckhart Tolle called it the pain-body‚Äîhow anger and pain take over, triggered by the smallest spark, flooding a person with thoughts and feelings that feed the fire, dragging both people down.

Each episode of rage or hidden resentment blackens the love, leaving grill marks on heart-meat, sizzling heat applied until it bursts. It isn‚Äôt just the explosions that break it; it‚Äôs the quiet, smoldering bitterness hidden behind a plastic smile.

Love languages matter not when anger consumes our souls. No kind words or gestures, gifts, or touch can fill the love tank faster than anger burns through it. For a bond to endure, that anger has to be controlled, defused, eliminated, or it will vaporize goodness until only stone remains.

Resentment the Controller
Resentment is anger‚Äôs sly cousin.

Resentment is remembered anger, a fire stoked by failure, by every disappointment, by every desire our lover fails to fulfill. If we cling to anger, if we permit it to fester instead of forgiving, those small flames gather strength over time, becoming a fierce blaze of unmet expectations and silent fury.

We hold our lovers accountable for every missed wish, every slight, until they stand at fault in our minds.

The fire inside sours our mood. Our lover notices, feels the distance, extends the olive branch.

They soften, meet our demands, try to ease our mood, offering what they can to bring back the tenderness we‚Äôve hidden away.

And in that moment, we‚Äôve trained ourselves in something dark, rewarded ourselves for using anger and resentment to push them into submission, to control the love we once shared.

We transform anger into something even darker, an implement of evil we then brandish to bully our partner. Anger and resentment, honed over time, come easily, almost naturally.

Our lover either bends to our will, doing exactly what we demand, or they face the fiery rocket blast of simmering resentment. It‚Äôs a trap, binding us to a script of our writing, fueled by flames we never extinguished.

Resentment has no home in a home.

We can‚Äôt feel love or intimacy when we‚Äôre burning with anger, so we hold back, letting our affection grow cold.

We wait for the anger to pass, but it never does.

Resentment, used as control, slowly erodes power. Demanding compliance and exercising authority‚Äîthese are masculine acts, powers that should be held with care and wielded with a sense of duty, never against the feminine.

Sometimes, in any relationship, a decision must stand firm, and yielding isn‚Äôt an option. Democracies fail with only two people. Wise leadership is superior.

But when a woman uses anger and resentment to shape her man‚Äôs actions, she sucks out his life force, not in his preferred way. Each time he submits, he weakens, browbeaten, pussyfied. Over time, she feels the change, her attraction fading as his power slips away.

And yet, the reverse holds true: a man who stands firm, whose inner strength leads her to follow, draws her closer, keeps the attraction alive.

Caustic Sarcasm
There‚Äôs a line between wit and cruelty. Playful banter, a subtle jab, the kind that‚Äôs laced with affection, playfulness‚Äîthat‚Äôs fun, bonding, the secret code for human chemistry. It‚Äôs a way to tease, to show love with a smile.

But biting sarcasm, the kind that stings and cuts, is something else. It‚Äôs a laugh delivered with a fist, concealing anger, delivering pain.

Each sharp word, each jab masked as a joke, chips away at affection. That bitterness doesn‚Äôt just sting; it saps attraction, leaving the relationship hollow and lifeless.

Caustic sarcasm becomes civil war, particularly if two masculine energies clash for power and control in the relationship.

When I am correctly masculine, women respond with less anger because I never reflect their anger, disarming them. When not a pre-existing propensity of hers, avoiding caustic sarcasm is my responsibility.

Entitlement Undermines Everything
Entitlement kills gratitude, emptying the joy from any gift given freely. When entitlement burdens someone, they greet unmet expectations with frustration, anger, or disappointment, never seeing the kindness behind what they receive.

This feeling of emotional entitlement stands opposed to gratitude, twisting generosity into a transaction, an act done from obligation rather than the heart.

In any relationship where one person feels entitled, the effect is unmistakable. We give generously, hoping for warmth and recognition, but instead feel unseen, our efforts acknowledged only as what‚Äôs ‚Äúowed.‚Äù

No one wants to freely give to someone who feels entitled to the gift, who sees kindness as an expectation, not a choice. Without genuine gratitude, there‚Äôs no return for the effort spent.

For me, the most precious gift a woman can give is the look of genuine thankfulness in her eyes. That‚Äôs the payoff, the reason men try so hard to make women happy.

In my heart, I need to feel that appreciation.

I can‚Äôt thrive in a relationship where my affection and attention are taken as due, where gratitude fades into entitlement.

Living With Passion
I can‚Äôt live in a passionless relationship. My energy flows freely, testosterone is high. I keep myself lean and fit, lifting weights and staying active daily. I may not be twenty anymore, but the fire still burns brightly. I need a relationship with real intimacy, not something platonic or watered down.

And I have my needs and kinks that I won‚Äôt compromise. Some desires are woven too deep. For me, passion has to be part of it, or there‚Äôs no point in the chase.

This is my fight song (hey)
Take back my life song (hey)
Prove I'm alright song (hey)
My power's turned on (hey)
Starting right now, I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song (hey)
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Fight Song‚ÄîRachel Platten

Being my Best Self
I focus on being my best self, refining the basics.

I pay attention to every detail in my dress and care for the sharpness in my appearance.

I push harder in my workouts, lifting with more purpose, and making each session count.

I build friendships and connect with others in my community.

I live a life with intention, one that a feminine woman would want to step into, drawn by the strength and steadiness in the foundation I lay.

I‚Äôm finding myself again, reclaiming what it means to be a man. I saw the problem clearly for the first time; I needed to change. 

My identity is defined by my actions, by pursuing what drives me, keeping my word to live morally and ethically, giving something back to the community around me.

I‚Äôm defining what masculine behavior means to me. My incomplete list includes the following: 

cultivating strength of heart, the courage to love, the resilience to recover from disappointment,

understanding and adapting to the needs of the feminine, always viewing disagreements through her feminine frame,

view the feminine as a helpless dove, protected from masculine resistance, especially my own,

improving self-discipline, the command and control over my body, my mind, and my choices, 

the determination and courage to make decisions and stand firm behind them, and

the thrill of a life lived with passion. 

I‚Äôm learning what it means to be the kind of man a woman would want at her side‚Äînot through new tricks, but by unlearning the false beliefs and habits that had dimmed my spark.

Now, I‚Äôm honest about who I am and what I expect. I make my choices freely, defend them with steady resolve, and feel no shame for what I think, say, and do.

My freedom is mine, and I intend to live it fully, with passion.

What does it take to be a man?

The will to give and not receive
The strength to say what you believe
The heart to feel what others feel inside
To see what they can see

A man is somethin' that's real
It's not what you are
It's what you can feel
It can't be too late
To look through the hate and see
I know that's what a man can be

Be a Man‚ÄîBoston

I‚Äôm building a foundation that won‚Äôt bend. I‚Äôve always been sensitive, maybe too empathic‚Äîa softness that leaned toward the feminine. I let others‚Äô beliefs slip into my own when I was younger, even when they clashed with what I felt was right. It was a weakness, a lack of confidence, allowing another‚Äôs view to replace my own. 

I also wasted energy on my own illusions, tainted by pride and arrogance. I was lost in beliefs that didn‚Äôt serve me.

But a wise man sees through these deceptions, his own and those of others. He grounds himself in what‚Äôs real, refusing to be swayed or reshaped by outside voices, even in conflict, especially in conflict.

That‚Äôs the worldview I‚Äôm forging‚Äîa life built on solid ground, untouched by the shifting world around it.

Compassion Reigns Supreme
I‚Äôm going deeper into my spiritual practice, but this time, I‚Äôm shaping it to strengthen who I am.

Before, it softened me and brought out the gentler, more feminine traits, and that was my mistake, not the practice itself. I‚Äôd let the teachings take a form that dulled my edge, not embracing them properly.

Now, I see it differently. My practice is a well of strength, a source of courage and resilience‚Äîthe marks of a firm, masculine man.

Compassion is the feeling of sadness for the suffering of another, coupled with the desire to relieve their pain. False bravado degrades this as bleeding heart nonsense, a weakness to be avoided.

In truth, feeling deeply the sadness of others takes tremendous strength of heart, the height of masculine power.

Compassion is masculine.

Compassion is the wellspring of Passion, the force of life.

I‚Äôm learning to weave these traits into my life, letting my heart guide me, but with the resolve of a steady hand and a clear mind.

Dating Again
If anyone thought this was a story of reconciliation, it isn‚Äôt. The divorce reasons remain, fixed like rusted iron. Over the past twenty years, we have released each other a piece at a time, painfully, like a slowly pulled bandage.

After the split, I thought I was ready to date. Our marriage had drifted into near indifference, and the slow separation left me emotionally unburdened.

I felt the usual concerns about finding someone new, but I created profiles on dating apps. I was pleased women were interested‚Äîbeautiful women, some of them much younger, even by thirty years, near my son‚Äôs age. Helpful anxiety relief.

Catching a woman‚Äôs attention hasn‚Äôt changed.

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

Sharp Dressed Man‚ÄîZZ Top

I didn‚Äôt turn to the apps out of need but out of curiosity, open to meeting someone compelling, or so I thought.

Yet, as the months passed, aversion crept in. I saw that I didn‚Äôt have to worry about anyone else‚Äôs thoughts or expectations for the first time in over two decades.

I yearned for freedom, not mental and emotional incarceration.

Obviously, I was closed-off and incomplete, not in the right frame for a new relationship, whole, free, open, accepting.

I needed to rediscover myself, my life, and my own vision of who I was and who I wanted to become. 

The work is ongoing. 

I stopped calls, texts, app chats. I froze the dating apps months ago, and they‚Äôve stayed that way. I don‚Äôt feel any urge to look.

When I‚Äôm ready‚Äîwhen I feel that spark‚ÄîI‚Äôll go back.

Until then, I‚Äôm giving myself time.

I have messes to clean up first.

Penance to the Ex-Wife
Burning the sorrow so deeply into my heart had side effects. At the deepest of the sobbing, the determination arose to make amends, manifesting in two desires: cleanse her heart, provide her lifelong security.

Now, I allow her to vent her rage, never defending, absorbing her truth, her pain. It‚Äôs a slow process; I inflicted a deep wound with much residual pain. It will take as long as it takes.

I‚Äôm her social security. If all else fails, I‚Äôll ensure she is taken care of. Even if we severed contact for many years, that obligation is buried deep, certain to arise.

She may ghost me to the degree she can, denying me an opportunity for redemption. She may find another man to provide her care.

I‚Äôll do whatever is reasonable and appropriate to comfort her.

Penance, the road to redemption, has no final destination, no resolution, no release.

I don‚Äôt foresee ever feeling that I did enough.

Future relationships
A future relationship could add something good to my life, but it isn‚Äôt essential.

I don‚Äôt need anyone.

If I‚Äôm mistaken about everything, and women reject me as a knuckle-dragging Luddite, a Neanderthal, so be it.

I‚Äôll let my hair grow. I‚Äôll overcome.

I‚Äôm content being alone, living a single life, and if I never marry again or find another long-term relationship, I‚Äôd be perfectly fine. I don‚Äôt feel any drive to bend myself to fit anyone else‚Äôs world.

It‚Äôs a common mindset among those of us who‚Äôve been through it before. Why tolerate negativity when it‚Äôs not required? I‚Äôve got my life, my peace, and I won‚Äôt compromise that lightly.

In any future relationship, I won‚Äôt tolerate what‚Äôs intolerable. 

I want a rare woman‚Äîspiritually enlightened, steady, a joyous soul living with an open heart.

She‚Äôll have no room for anger or resentment, none of the poisons of jealousy or insecurity.

She‚Äôll live without the chains of attachment, won‚Äôt cling, won‚Äôt control.

She‚Äôll live without haunting ghosts from past relationships, no deception or infidelity, no dangerous foibles.

She‚Äôll be ready to follow a man who proves his leadership daily.

And yes, she‚Äôll be hot, and we will share chemistry, releasing primal energies that defy containment.

I‚Äôm done with power struggles, done with the conflict of masculine energies clashing. She‚Äôs not the one if I‚Äôm forced to pick and choose battles.

And there‚Äôs no room in my life for anyone who can‚Äôt fully accept that my son is a part of it. That‚Äôs non-negotiable.

For the right person, I‚Äôm open‚Äîbut only if she brings the same clarity and strength I display. It‚Äôs a daunting search challenge, but I‚Äôm putting it into the universe here, now.

What will Karma send my way?

For any future relationship, sharing a worldview matters deeply. We know how easily expectations can clash when we cross into different cultures, religions, or political beliefs.

Society thrives on diversity, but at a personal level, it can be a challenge. Much of what we expect in relationships‚Äîgender roles, ways of handling conflict‚Äîcomes from what we absorbed in our upbringing, embedded in us without us even knowing. And when those unspoken expectations don‚Äôt line up, it creates friction.

I‚Äôve seen this before; I‚Äôve lived it.

I acted against my spouse‚Äôs wishes, driven by an underlying worldview that didn‚Äôt match hers. Now, it‚Äôs clear to me that alignment in beliefs about gender roles and conflict resolution is essential.

When couples share this foundation, they encounter fewer conflicts and handle those that arise more easily. However, if the customs and beliefs are further apart, friction becomes a drag, challenging to overcome.

Every person is part gold, part dirt. The richness in a relationship isn‚Äôt just in the gold but in the dirt you can tolerate‚Äîmaybe even learn to value over time.

I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little
Of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere
In sight

One of These Nights ‚Äî The Eagles

One day, I‚Äôll step into a new relationship. When the moon and stars fall into place, I‚Äôll feel fully myself‚Äîstrong, masculine, and ready to meet a woman whose spirit mirrors my own, who‚Äôs just as prepared for what lies ahead. 

Then, it‚Äôs up to Karma, or Fate, or God, to set up that perfect moment, that serendipitous meet-cute that shifts everything.

I hold onto the faith that finding the right person brings rewards beyond words. We‚Äôre social creatures, born with an innate goodness that runs deep, an instinct coded into us. We all want to feel loved, valued, respected, truly seen, appreciated, and wholeheartedly accepted. 

Meeting another brave soul is only a matter of patience, resolve, and the courage to live fully. 

I believe a brave heart always prevails.

I feel optimism in my bones‚Äîfor life, happiness, and the unknown adventures still waiting to unfold."<br>

<i>[11/25/2024, 10:19:24 AM]</i> üëâ <b>ü§ñ Assistant</b>: 

Got it! I'll analyze the provided text according to your outlined instructions. Here's the response:

---

I remember how it began, the search for a mate, raw and instinctual. At first, the desires were basic: sex, looks, the thrill of a partner‚Äôs touch. I took what I could, like a ship docking wherever there was shelter. But as time passed, I gathered disappointments, one by one, building a list‚Äîwhat I needed, what I could do without, and what I could never stand. The crazies, the angry, the wounded‚Äîthose who demanded too much or gave too little.

Some things couldn‚Äôt be ignored. Anger, for one, drained relationships like a bucket with a hole. Eckhart Tolle called it the pain-body, but to me, it felt more like fire: a spark that turned into a blaze, consuming love and leaving ash in its wake. A lover‚Äôs rage, whether explosive or quiet and simmering, blackened the heart, leaving marks impossible to heal. There was no room for kindness when anger burned hotter than affection. I saw it, clear as day, and I knew: if anger lived there, love would die.

Resentment didn‚Äôt lag far behind. It built slowly, like a silent ember, ignited by unmet expectations and unspoken wounds. We‚Äôd punish each other, subtly at first, then with more force. Resentment twisted affection into a tool for control‚Äîa game where someone always lost. I‚Äôd thought I was strong, but those flames weakened me, sapping my resolve until I hardly recognized myself. It wasn‚Äôt love; it was war.

Sarcasm crept in next, sharp and cutting. I‚Äôd always enjoyed playful banter, a little teasing that brought us closer. But this? This was different. Each jab masked as humor chipped away at whatever bond we‚Äôd shared. The cruelty became a weapon, a signal that affection had turned into a fight for dominance.

Entitlement followed, draining gratitude and twisting generosity into a burden. No matter what I gave, it felt expected, as though my kindness was owed, not earned. Without the warmth of gratitude, my heart grew colder. I needed that look in her eyes, the one that said she appreciated me, but instead, I found a void. It wasn‚Äôt enough, and I knew it never would be.

I looked inward. Passion, I realized, mattered more than I‚Äôd admitted. I stayed active, felt the fire in my blood, and knew I couldn‚Äôt live in a relationship without it. I needed the spark, the chemistry, the primal energy that made life worth chasing. Anything less felt hollow.

In the aftermath, I rebuilt. I focused on the basics: my body, my friendships, my spirit. I rediscovered the strength of masculinity‚Äînot arrogance or pride, but the quiet confidence of a man who knows himself. I saw where I‚Äôd gone wrong, where I‚Äôd given away too much, let others shape me into something I wasn‚Äôt. Now, I held firm, building a foundation that wouldn‚Äôt bend.

Compassion took on a new meaning. I once thought it made me soft, but now I saw its strength. It wasn‚Äôt weakness to feel deeply, to care for others‚Äîit was courage, the kind that required resilience and resolve. Compassion, I realized, was the heart of masculinity.

I tried dating again, curious at first, then disillusioned. The apps promised connection but delivered noise. I turned inward, recognizing I wasn‚Äôt ready‚Äînot for someone else, not yet. I needed to clean up my own messes, find clarity, and live fully before I could share my life with another.

I felt penance pulling at me, the need to make things right with my ex-wife. The pain I‚Äôd caused her weighed on me, a debt I couldn‚Äôt repay. I offered her the space to vent, absorbed her anger, and committed to her security, knowing I might never find redemption.

Future relationships no longer felt urgent. I could live alone, content with the life I‚Äôd rebuilt. But if the right woman came along‚Äîenlightened, joyful, unburdened by the past‚ÄîI‚Äôd be ready. She‚Äôd have to match my clarity, my strength, and my refusal to compromise on what mattered.

I believed in fate, in the serendipity of meeting someone who shared my soul‚Äôs rhythm. Until then, I‚Äôd wait, knowing that life, love, and happiness would find me when I stood whole, unshaken, and alive with passion.
