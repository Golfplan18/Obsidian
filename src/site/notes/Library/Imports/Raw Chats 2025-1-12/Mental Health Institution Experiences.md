meta description "I had what could be described as a religious experience in the safety of my home.

Our culture accepts many Christian forms of this experience, revivals, speaking in tongues, and so forth, but if the experience is not Christian, it’s viewed with skepticism.

My experience was facilitated by my 35-year study of Tibetan Buddhism, with the last 7 years being accelerated by many hours in float tanks practicing Lamrim in total sensory deprivation.

This is not a common life experience.

The medical establishment has officially diagnosed me based on three interviews with professionals with various levels of medical training up through a fully licensed psychiatrist.

I am bipolar and prone to mania. I currently suffer from an extreme case of mania.

Apparently, extreme happiness is a sign of a mental disorder. I wouldn’t have guessed that prior to this experience.

I still find that shocking.

It is amusing really, since their opinion means so little to me.

I am working with my personal physician to gather enough data points to establish a new medical definition.

I am bipolar with constant and unrelenting mania of only the positive pole.

The criteria for this particular diagnosis are difficult to meet.

The patient must be jubilantly happy all the time, totally excited to be alive.

The patient must display boundless energy and perfect physical health.

The patient must have at least 20 years of disciplined meditation practice; Buddhist or Indian mysticism is preferred, Tibetan Buddhism being the gold standard.

The patient must be interviewed by other Tibetan Buddhist practitioners (or whatever mystic branch is involved) who provide 3rd party legitimacy.

It’s a high bar.

If enough time passes and the mania fails to subside and the other pole is never even glimpsed, I am convinced the new diagnosis will stick.

You never know; the medical community is very committed to their erroneous point of view.

Trigger Warning

I will use foul language and extremely graphic descriptions that will likely make you feel very, very uncomfortable.

I am not exaggerating in any way, and no statement that follows is fiction.

This writing is non-fiction.

However, if pressed for court testimony, I can’t attest to every single detail as I may be mistaken about a few of the fine details.

However, by and large, what you read is what actually went down.

Chaos and Confusion

The following observations are not in any particular order.

A Mental Health Institution is in chaos due to chronic understaffing by greedy corporate fucks, and the primary emotion of the patients is confusion.

The anecdotes and observations should hit you at random, with no time to absorb what you read.

You should feel the same chaos and confusion as those who must endure these environments daily.

https://youtu.be/_tXVYXs4F-k

The Facility

The facility is Pacific Grove Hospital in Riverside, California.

None of the problems below are the fault of staff.

The staff was remarkable, but they struggled with chronic underfunding because the corporate assholes were maximizing their profits at the expense of patients and staff.

I hope every investor in this facility feels their rightful shame as an enabler and beneficiary of the fruits of evil.

Their money is poisoned.

https://youtu.be/asOQ6UR2R4o

The simple moment that encapsulated all that’s wrong with the system

I had a roommate who snored with a volume so high that I could not sleep easily even with earplugs (which were precious and often unavailable).

I would roam the hallway pacing endlessly to dissipate my energy and induce tiredness so that I could collapse for two hours in my uncomfortable bed before waking again.

It wasn’t really a bed, more of a shelf with a thin surface pad. Both the thin pad and the pillow were plastic-wrapped, which guaranteed night sweats.

On the last night, I was shocked by a patient who followed me 60' down the hallway without my noticing him.

This shocked me because I quickly became hypervigilant about patient attacks from behind — a necessary survival instinct.

More on that later. This environment is dangerous.

The patient I faced was a harmless man.

Man with outstretched arms asking for a hug

He made three simple statements.

I feel anxiety.

I am Christian.

I want a hug.

I was impressed by his clarity of communication in conveying his needs, particularly since he was standing with open arms and visibly shaking. His face bore a look of intense longing and shock at his circumstance.

It broke my heart.

I wanted desperately to reach out and comfort this man.

But providing comforting hugs is against the rules.

(I get that inappropriate touching is a major concern, but the rigidity of this rule is astonishing.)

I led him to the nurse’s station, explaining to him that I was not allowed to hug him, but perhaps we could ask the staff to make an exception if explained clearly and done in front of the staff.

I clearly explained this to the duty nurse and three other staff awake at 3:30 AM, telling them I would like to fulfill his request.

Amy responded:

That’s against the rules.

(to the other patient) Sir, Please go back to bed. Your meds will kick in soon.

We don’t do hugs here.

That pretty much summed it up.

Compassion is truly dead at these establishments — by design.

https://youtu.be/dpscD2vagsA

The Shower

I only took three showers during my five days.

There was only one semi-working shower at the facility. To take a shower, a patient must go to the duty station and request it.

You are then put on a list that nobody checks. No staff member seeks you out when you are at the front of the line.

But if you are persistent and ask every couple of hours, you may hit one of those windows when it’s not in use, and it’s allowed.

There are many periods of time when no showers are permitted.

I missed a group meeting, so I asked if I could use the open shower.

Nope.

Not during group hours.

The shower had a hot-cold mechanism that nobody could understand — even the staff.

(Genevieve, Remember how long you messed with that dial? Don’t feel bad; no one can figure it out. Brett finally realized you needed to align the arrow to the blue dot to make the water lukewarm. I think they connected the pipes backward.)

Cold showers were the rule, but if you were lucky, you could find that one spot on the dial (it was an odd dial) that made the water lukewarm.

I still shivered.

The shower itself is cleaned only once per day. It is not cleaned between each use.

Getting into an uncleaned shower after a dozen Schizophrenics is something that’s difficult to imagine.

Since I did not have my phone, or any contact with the outside world, I could not take a picture to document it.

The stench was foul.

A mixture of vomit, feces, sweat, and the residual cleaning solution smell left over from the cleaner’s valiant effort to clean that shower each day.

The cleaners are amazing women, all women, who see and touch unspeakable filth each day.

The floor of the shower was white, but the perimeter was dusted with pubic hairs of many sizes and colors and loose debris that doesn’t get washed down the drain.

There were food particles and unusual liquids flowing down the walls suggestive of vomit (I’m pretty sure it was vomit, but I chose not to inspect too closely.)

There were towels left in the corner of the shower. They were saturated, and there was a thin brown film that looked like diarrhea, but it was probably just the dissolving feces wrapped up inside.

I tried to position my feet to avoid the streams of vomit and diarrhea.

I believe I succeeded, and my physician confirmed that I have no infections.

Disease transmission must be a problem. They probably cover it up. At a minimum, they fail to explore the cause.

The lukewarm water induced shivering, and I shook violently as I quickly washed my body.

I found the temperature uncomfortable, but the nurse reminded me that cold showers are actually better for you, so I tried to take comfort in that.

The staff knows how bad the situation is.

None of them would ever consider using that shower.

I would very much like to see the corporate brass and investors go shower there.

Something might change.

Have you ever seen Trainspotting? This scene captures my impression of that shower perfectly. It’s hard to watch. Gag warning.

https://youtu.be/P88cV5mFWoI

Chap Stick

Southern California is quite dry. It’s common to apply chapstick almost daily to prevent dry, cracking lips.

When I am at my home, I locate one of the dozen or more sticks I spread around my house, and I apply it.

The time between me noticing my need and my need being met is usually measured in seconds.

Obtaining a chapstick in a mental institution requires a prescription from an overworked doctor.

I asked for chapstick at 6:00 AM.

I finally obtained a small squirt of Carmex (not a full tube) at 10:00 PM, 16 hours later.

Voluntary Check-in For My Family

I checked into the facility voluntarily to assuage my wife’s and my parents’ concerns about my mental health.

I appreciated their concern.

Prior to this event, I was a disturbed husband and son, like most men passing middle age.

I would get angry and defensive if my foibles were pointed out. I would manipulate to get what I wanted, and I didn’t feel much remorse over my bad behavior.

Suddenly, I lost all remaining stains from my heart, I embraced personal responsibility, I found unshakable inner peace, and I discovered a renewed excitement for life.

My wife also witnessed the event where all the changes came together in a manic religious experience.

We didn’t go to a church revival in search of this. Everything occurred at our home.

She was not prepared for what she saw.

She was right to be concerned.

When checking into this facility, I had a good idea of what I was getting into, but they had no clue.

They thought I was spending a few days at Club Med. Or perhaps it was like those Hollywood recovery centers that are basically resorts with some treatment.

This facility wasn’t like that.

When I told them some of these stories, they were heartbroken, and they felt deep regret for ever convincing (demanding) that I go.

It’s actually been more traumatic for them because they don’t have my inner strength.

My family’s experience makes me sad and somewhat passionate about obtaining justice; thus you’re reading this.

Unlockable Doors

By far, the most unsettling thing for me was the complete lack of personal safety.

The doors of patient rooms can’t be locked.

Anyone walking down the hallways, patients and staff included, can freely walk into your personal room at any time of the day or night.

Patient-on-patient violence is an ever-present concern.

And since the facility is chronically understaffed, when staff’s attention is diverted elsewhere (which happens often), the patients are completely unprotected.

Completely Unprotected.

Completely Unprotected.

Completely Unprotected!

https://youtu.be/TuYb6ZNQaZo

And what’s worse is that this situation could easily be corrected with a little technology. Patient doors could be card-locked so that only the patients sleeping there and staff can open the doors.

This isn’t done because security costs money. It’s certainly not because the task is difficult in any way.

As a result, good patients are subject to the whims of deranged and psychotic patients who may be large, young, strong, and impossible to reason with.

I’m in excellent physical condition for a man of my size and age, and I have experience with martial arts training that’s 30 years out of practice.

That doesn’t provide much defense against any large, psychotic young man who can’t distinguish right from wrong.

I ran into two of those.

Attacker #1

Around dinner time on day 3, a new patient appeared.

He was a young man in his early 20s and apparently in full command of his mental abilities (not Schizophrenic or psychotic).

He lacked good judgment, probably due to excessive drug use, but he wasn’t unpredictable.

He began showing other patients, including me, some kind of vaping pen with a flat triangular base and a small tip. He offered it to everyone in the room.

I’m not certain what drug he filled it with, but since we were sitting among many recovering drug users, Steven (a patient) and I reported him to the nurse.

They confiscated his contraband (Staff calls all items patients are forbidden to have contraband), but they didn’t remove him from our unit.

He realized I was responsible for telling on him, but he didn’t realize Steven also was responsible.

He told Steven he planned to attack me from behind and do as much damage to me as possible.

He was foolish to share that information with Steven.

Kill was his exact word, but lacking any weapons, that wasn’t realistic. I don’t wish to exaggerate by calling him a would-be killer.

The violence in his heart failed to match the capabilities of his body, fortunately.

Steven and I played a cat-and-mouse game with him, ensuring to keep Steven between us at all times while looking like it was just regular conversation.

At one point, I approached the nurse’s station and turned my back to the hallway. I could still see him reflected in the glass, but he didn’t realize this.

He came down the hall behind me and was within 5' of me with my back to him.

He saw that there were too many people around, so he chose not to make his move.

I was on a hair trigger so that I would have avoided any assault, but I was anxious to see if he had the Courage to act on his bad intentions.

I managed to avoid him for 3 hours.

Finally, Dr. Chaffee, the psychiatrist made an appearance, and Steven and I told him what happened.

Fortunately, with Steven’s backing, Dr. Chaffee believed us, and immediately removed the assailant from the ward.

https://youtu.be/5pHEizsPuP0

He spent the next 24 hours in the maximum security area of the facility.

I observed that when people emerge from that wing, they seldom cause trouble again.

I can only imagine how awful the conditions are there.

Attacker # 2

My second assailant was not someone who hated me for a reason.

When David arrived at the facility, I greeted him warmly and listened to him intently. Apparently, this is not something he’s accustomed to.

He became very attached to me, and he lacked boundaries, so I finally had to start avoiding him. My avoidance made him more aggressive.

However, I hadn’t seen him for several hours, so I thought he had forgotten about me.

He had not.

At 3:30 AM, my door burst open as he smashed it hard with the base of his open palm (at least, that’s how I speculate he did it. I am uncertain because I didn’t actually see it.)

Fortunately, I was awake due to the stress of the earlier assailant (this was 6 hours after the first one was taken away.)

I jumped up, slammed the door in his face, barely missing him, and I wedged my foot and hand against the door to secure it.

He didn’t push, but he wouldn’t have gotten in if he had tried because I had superior leverage.

After a few minutes, I went down to the nurse’s station to report the incident.

They didn’t do anything about it.

At 6:30 AM, David barged into Dennis’s room.

Dennis is a sweet, completely harmless and helpless man who suffers extreme pain due to a hernia.

Dennis is awaiting a scheduled operation in January, surviving on Percocet and morphine. His condition is very sad.

David became upset with Dennis for reasons unknown.

To express his displeasure, he hocked up a green loogie and spit it onto Dennis’s face.

The slimy spittle rolled down Dennis’s cheek. He did nothing in response.

David was satisfied, and he left Dennis alone.

When Dennis reported what happened, that report got David sedated and removed from the population for about 24 hours.

Interestingly, David, one of my assailants, is one of the patients I call out as a friend.

After the incident, I avoided him.

He finally summoned the courage to politely ask me if he could speak with me, and I agreed.

He humbly offered his apologies and showed genuine regret.

Of course, I forgave him immediately and praised him for his courage.

He showed himself a true spiritual warrior, and I salute him.

Remarkable man."<br>

meta description "What monkeys teach us about grasping after objects of Desire.

I want things.

We all want things.

Perhaps it’s a car, a job, a lover. We all have worldly concerns, and we all pursue or own selfish desires.

Even Buddhist practitioners advanced on the path develop a feeling called Bodhicitta, which is the desire to become personally enlightened for the sake of other people.

Releasing personal, Selfish Desire is the final step on the journey to Enlightenment, or so I’m told.

I haven’t released my Selfish Desire yet.

Desirous Attachment

Desirous Attachment forms when observing a worldly object, feeling it to be attractive, exaggerating its positive qualities, and developing strong feelings toward possession of that worldly object.

When you first came into existence as pure aware consciousness, there was just observation.

In the first moment of self-awareness, consciousness observes itself and realizes “I exist.”

Buddhists call this the primordial error.

In the next moment comes the feeling, “I am important.”

And with it, we give birth to Selfish Desire, our instinct to survive, and other primal forces needed for individual survival.

Selfish Desire is the second item in the consciousness boot-up sequence.

It’s deep.

Let me show you just how deep it is.

The Monkey Trap of Desire

Did you know that you can capture a monkey by exploiting a trap in their mind?

This is an amazing illustration of Grasping at objects of Desire.

https://youtu.be/IpJmpClJi4E

Please, watch and learn. This young man gets it.

All the monkey has to do is release the object of Desire, and the monkey will regain its freedom.

Yet it doesn’t.

It can’t.

That second item on the boot-up sequence is so deeply ingrained that no amount of competing desires can overcome it.

Even the desire for personal freedom, at the risk of death!

Satiation is an Illusion

Satiating Desires is futile.

Another Desire arises in replacement.

Repeatedly.

Perpetually.

The Wheel of Saṃsāra. Spinning like a roulette wheel.

We are balls bouncing, banging, trapped forever inside.

True Satiation is a doorway.

Extinguish desire, the door opens, you exit Samsara and enter Nirvana, the Pure Land of Total Inner Peace.

The First Noble Truth of the Buddha

The First Noble Truth is about our relationship with desire.

Each encounter with objects of desire leaves behind feelings of weakness or a lack of fulfillment.

Life becomes defined by a low-grade sense of dissatisfaction, like everything is “Meh.”

While pursuing Desire, you exist in a constant state of lack, unsatisfied and disappointed.

Lack Sucks.

Lack drains Qi.

It eats you up inside.

It’s Sisyphus from ancient Greece, endlessly pushing that emotional boulder up the hill, tasting brief satisfaction at the peak before tumbling down, repeating the cycle over and over again.

Consumer Society is a Monkey Trap

It’s our empty consumer society promising happiness and fulfillment with a new car, a new house, social status, and conspicuous consumption.

Most people don’t obtain their objects of desire to discover the truth of their emptiness.

Many who obtain everything they want refuse to acknowledge that emptiness because the regret over a wasted lifetime chasing rainbows is too much to bear.

The provided meta description appears to be a summary or introduction to a piece of content that discusses the concept of desire, attachment, and the human condition from a philosophical and Buddhist perspective. It touches on the idea that human desires are deeply ingrained and can lead to suffering, as well as the pursuit of true inner peace through extinguishing desire.

It also makes an analogy with a monkey trap to illustrate how desire can entrap individuals and discusses the cycle of desire and dissatisfaction in consumer society.

Overall, it seems to be a thought-provoking and introspective piece that explores the nature of desire and its impact on human life and happiness.<br>

compose a meta description for the following "Hungry Ghost

Children’s fairy tales contain simple, important lessons. Humpty Dumpty makes me cautious.

Emotions aren’t complex intellectual erector sets of thought.

They're simple.

Basic.

Emotional seeds blossom like flowers to guide your heart.

Buddhist traditions have stories about Hungry Ghosts.

A hungry ghost is the manifestation of unquenchable Desire.

It points to a powerful coalition of feelings that motivates unwise choices and drives foolish behavior.

By identifying that force and noting its impact on your heart, some measure of control is possible.

The Wish Fulfilling Tree captures the powerful and unpredictable nature of craving.

Magic wish-fulfilling tree

The Wish Fulfilling Tree

A weary spiritual seeker sits below a magic wish-fulfilling tree.

He thinks, “It would be nice if I had a drink of water to quench my thirst.” And in the next moment, a cup of water appears. He thinks it odd that such a thing could occur, but he quenches his Thirst without inquiring further.

Then he thinks, “It would be nice if I had food, shelter, and someone to share it with.” And in the next moment, everything appears in front of him. He thinks it odd, but he satisfies his Desires without inquiring further.

Then he thinks, “I’ve roamed the earth looking for satisfaction only to be left wanting. But here at this place, I get everything I desire. How wonderful!” His curiosity satiated for the moment; he dropped that thought without inquiring further.

Then he thinks, “It must be this powerful tree that grants my wishes. I wonder if it creates bad things too? Perhaps it will create a powerful monster that will consume me?”

And it did.

(The end)

Hungry Ghost

Whoa!

Jarring ending.

WTF happened?

I don’t get it. I want more!

Like many Buddhist stories, the meaning isn’t apparent upon first reading, but the lesson I’ve taken from this story is about my relationship with Wanting.

Jack Kornfield, The Roots of Buddhist Psychology was Buddhism 101 for me. I’ve listened to all 9 hours many, many times! Thank you planting seeds of virtue as you showed me my mind. Fabulous!!!

provide a meta description for "When Will We Discuss Special Needs Parenting?
The entire post thus far has been preparing you for what you will read next.

Without the background, you would not trust me, and you wouldn’t have been emotionally primed to feel the more difficult emotions we will encounter next.

I initially excluded this long opening section, and the post lost its power.

You needed to be guided to this point.

We will soon delve into the deepest, darkest place in the human heart.

Without preparation, you wouldn’t be able to take it.

I’ve done my best to prepare you.

Please read on.

Best Boy in the Whole World
If you read my bio, you see that I have an adult son with cognitive disabilities, a diagnosis of autism.

He’s undeniably special in so many ways.

His disability means he lacks sophisticated ego development.

In some ways, his mind is a pure land without some of the strong negative emotions that burden many of us.

In other ways, his mind is unrelenting chaos and confusion, leaving him completely helpless.

He requires 24-hour care.

I still hold his hand when we cross a street.

When my wife and I recognized our Fate, his condition forced a lot of unwanted spiritual growth upon us both.

The Moment We Knew He Was Autistic
We had been noticing our son was unusual since he was a baby. Most notably, we were dismayed by the lack of eye contact.

He refused to look at us.

No matter what we did, he simply wouldn’t hold our gaze.

We were new parents, but we knew that wasn’t right. We carried on, hoping it was a phase he would grow out of.

One day, my wife came across a magazine article that listed the signs of autism. My son checked every box.

My wife immediately knew.

She showed the article to me, and I immediately knew.

We didn’t take it to be good news.

R.E.M. gets it.
The Incipient Error
We didn’t know it at the time, but in that moment of acceptance of his condition, we made a huge mistake that took us about 15 years to correct.

We thought this was terrible news.

It was not.

It certainly wasn’t what we wanted. No parent wants to discover their child has limitations, serious limitations on his ability to contribute to the world or even care for himself.

We had no shortage of friends and family willing to confirm our worst fears that our life was over and we needed to eat a shit sandwich.

We found support groups that further reinforced that we had endured this awful tragedy, and someday if we were lucky, we would develop a taste for shit sandwiches and choke them down as a badge of honor.

That’s fucked up.

This mistaken interpretation of our circumstances was the incipient error.

If I had known then what I know now, 15 years of heartache for my family could have been avoided entirely.

Saving you that 15 years of suffering is why I wrote this.

I hope you learn this lesson sooner.

If you want to really explore the power of incipient ideas, I suggest you watch the movie Inception. It’s incredible, and it makes the point I’m pointing to here better than I ever could.
The Going Gets Tough
Like most parents who discover they have a problem, my wife and I set out to do something about it.

This wasn’t a bad choice.

You wouldn’t ignore your child’s illness and allow it to remain untreated.

It wasn’t our actions; it was the spirit and intention behind our actions that created problems.

Our intention was to “cure” our son. To change him.

We were rejecting who he was in favor of who we wanted him to be.

We still want him to grow and improve, and we make every effort and accommodation for him, but while striving for more, we are entirely content and happy with him, just the way he is.

That was not our initial mindset. At least, I know it was not mine.

This mindset was a toxically poisonous cocktail for my heart.

I rejected my child and insisted that he be someone other than who he is.

Not openly and overtly to his face, but secretly, buried in a dark corner of my heart.

Fighting and Losing
One of the most toxic attitudes I encountered feigns righteous goodness.

The idea is that I would fight for my child no matter what and never rest until he is cured, fixed, made unbroken.

This was a commitment to rejection.

I was setting my intention on fighting a battle against accepting my son for who he was.

I didn’t persist in this notion long, fortunately.

This war couldn’t be won, and the only wise course of action was not to enter the conflict.

Drop the toxic idea that you will cure or fix your special needs child.

Sorry to state this so bluntly, but you will not succeed.

The futility of entering no-win scenarios is the key lesson from the Movie War Games. It’s a short clip. Watch and learn.
Anger, Anger, and More Anger
Whenever most people encounter something they don’t want, they get angry.

This anger may be directed at someone or something or an unfocused rage against God or Fate.

It’s victim thinking, and it distracts from the underlying sadness.

When the parent of a special needs child gets the diagnosis, all their dreams of the future collapse in a heap.

Anger is the most common initial reaction, but if any parent digs deeper, they find an endless reservoir of sadness.

It’s a despair and pain so deep you can’t imagine surviving a plunge into that cold water.

Yet, every parent must go there, cry an ocean of tears, and cleanse the sadness from the heart.

There is no other way.

Tears wash the stains from your heart.

Green Day writes some of the finest and most moving songs I’ve encountered. Masterful. This song aptly captures the death of a parent’s dreams for their child and the despair that follows.
The Soul Death of a Thousand Slights
The experience of most special needs parents when they take their child out into the world is a death of a thousand slights.

When my son was in toddler time, he couldn’t figure out itsy-bitsy-spider. All the other children could. My wife would sit and weep, powerless to do anything about it.

Life is full of millions of those little disappointments.

When my son was 9, we purchased a gumball machine because he liked watching the gumballs circle down the track to where the gumball came out.

He kept clamoring for gumballs, so we thought we might have to get rid of it.

We didn’t need to. I simply covered it with a towel, and it disappeared.

He could walk right up to the large gumball dispenser only disguised by a thin white sheet, and it no longer existed in his world.

That’s sad.

These experiences are repeated over and over and over again.

Each one is a painful reminder of his limitations.

It sucked.

And the main reason it was so painful is because we failed to accept his condition.

Each incident was a reminder of how fucked up our child was.

That was doubly sad because it didn’t need to be that way.

The Lure of Snake Oil
Desperate parents searching for a cure are susceptible to all manner of ripoffs by con artists selling Snake Oil.

This is reinforced by stories such as Lorenzo’s Oil, where a parent really did find a cure for an unusual medical condition through dogged research.

Every special needs parent thinks they will be the lucky one who discovers the cure.

It’s not going to happen.

This scene is gripping. The worst news a parent could possible obtain.
If you have money, there is no shortage of hucksters willing to take your money.

We know a family that purchased a hyperbaric oxygen chamber for their home, thinking it would be a cure.

I installed stereo speakers on each side of my son’s crib so that I could play brainwave entrainment music to influence his brain states.

We sat through a sales pitch from a doctor who was an expert on magnetic resonance therapy. It would have cost us more than a new car.

Many parents go down the diet and nutrition rabbit hole and determine gluten or wheat is their enemy. They embark on mineral chelation therapies.

It’s not that these snake oil treatments provide no benefit, but it’s certainly true that they don’t cure autism, and they never will.

The worst part of the sales pitch is when the huckster says, “What if this was the cure? Wouldn’t you want to try and make sure?”

Playing on the emotions of desperate parents is a ticket straight to Hell. The Passionate Rage I feel, beckons me to facilitate their journey.

Save your money, and don’t purchase snake oil.

Accepting The Awful Truth
Parent support groups and even entire charities devoted to doing something about autism share a common mindset.

Parents must learn to accept their awful fate.

This attitude is slowly changing, at least publicly, but little has changed privately.

For the most part, parents are convinced their child is broken, and they must learn to accept a defective misfit.

That is wrong on many levels.

This will move you. Even misfits want to bring joy to others by simply being themselves. If only their parents could accept that. Sad.
Patient Acceptance
Buddhists call the process of dissipating anger from disappointment Patient Acceptance.

When I was young, if my parents became upset because I wasn’t learning something, their displeasure strongly motivated me to figure things out.

That approach is completely counterproductive, particularly with special needs children.

I developed endless patience, and through accepting him, I learned what acceptance really is.

Love is accepting someone exactly as they are, wholeheartedly, not wanting them to be any different.

That lesson took 15 me years to learn.

I wish I could apply it to my wife. We would have less conflict.

I hope you learn it quicker than I did.

provide a meta description for "It's a long story, but I have a close friend who lives in Nigeria, one of those places where slavers raided when taking free men and enslaving them.

Many African Americans (note the need for ongoing political correctness) descend from free men enslaved out of Nigeria.

My friend, Samuel, feels a kinship toward them.

One day, we were discussing Chattel Slavery, the Heart Stain of the Confederacy, and he said to me:

I understand why my brothers react so strongly to the word “Nigger” since it embodies all the pain of Chattel Slavery, but why don’t they just wear that as a badge of honor?

They are the Strong ones.

They Endured.

That idea absolutely floored me. It resonated with me because it was a great example of turning Darkness into Light.

He went on:

The stains of Chattel Slavery are on the Confederacy and anyone Lording over another.

But if we Niggers allow their stains to justify Hating them, then their stains becomes our stains, and our hearts are poisoned too.

Hatred never ceases by Hatred.

His wisdom was undeniable. Despite the fact Samuel is 25 years my junior, he was 25,000 years ahead of me in seeing into people’s hearts.

But he wasn’t done:

I admire my brothers in America.

I invite my brothers to join me in celebration of being a Nigger.

Nigeria has a long and glorious history of creating communities and doing good. That was Nigeria until it became a colonial pen, an open-air prison like Gaza, only larger.

He really had me excited at this point, but the pain of colonialism hit home. It’s just another form of slavery, just a bit better disguised, dressed up for the public so that we don’t see it for what it is.

I felt his voice rising, passion welling up in him:

If my brothers stood up, together, united, and bellowed at the top of their lungs, “I AM A NIGGER!” And wore that label as a badge of honor, the Haters and the Masters would be defeated. Beaten at their own game!

I felt I needed to share his wisdom.

I hope it touches your heart.

I’ve asked Samuel if I can share his picture. If you see it below, he agreed.

(A humble man, he seeks no fame. The Picture will need to wait.)

Wisdom is NOT Determined by Age

Samuel is 25 years younger than I am, a second son, really (I’m working toward his immigration if he wants to leave). Surprisingly, he’s torn about leaving Nigeria.

He loves his country, but it’s a low-grade prison where corrupt leaders must deal with grinding poverty and ever-present unrest that explodes every so often in a flash of bloodshed.

It’s a difficult place to raise a family. Can you imagine living where there is no 911? No police to save you if thugs pound on the door of your home? I understand why he’s ready to leave now.

But why would he ever have wanted to be there?

The story that changed everything for me

When he was in college, and still single, he demonstrated to me that he is a true spiritual master.

He showed me my own weaknesses and shortcomings.

The Worst of the Worst of the Worst

When Samual graduated college, he volunteered to teach at rural schools for a year, living on whatever pay was offered.

Most people who put themselves into this lottery (something I never would have done) hope for a plumb assignment in a safe and comfortable area (my bare minimum requirement).

By chance, he was assigned to one of the worst schools in a dangerous area run by a woman who didn’t like him, and the pay was barely enough to buy food.

Most people would have recoiled at this.

I certainly would have cried victim tears, which is why his decision and reasoning shocked me and made me realize just how far ahead of me he was.

He said:

If I had not taken that job, it either would have been filled by someone less skilled and caring than me, or it wouldn’t be filled at all, probably the latter. Either way, the young children, innocent and pure, they would have a poor education, or no education at all.

I couldn’t live with that, so I stayed.

Twelve months in hell — by choice.

My Master

Samuel,

With deepest and sincerest thanks, I honor you, my Master. Your wisdom, your choices, and your actions showed me my weaknesses. There is no greater gift.

provide a meta description for the following "https://youtu.be/l482T0yNkeo

Hell is Real

Scholars, philosophers, and theologians enjoy debating the existence of Hell.

Religious people promote the idea. They believe it has utility for controlling people’s bad behavior.

People hurt each other for selfish reasons because they believe they can get away with it.

Most religions and cultures invent a Hell as a catch-all insurance policy against getting-away-with-it while you were alive, hoping perhaps this will motivate a few people to “be good” to avoid eternal damnation.

As a concept, it’s become so burdened by legalese, endless, pointless debates on dogma, and philosophical mental masturbation that it no longer has enough emotional impact to scare people straight, assuming it ever did.

But you don’t need to be religious to see that Hell exists, right now, today.

Have you ever watched true crime dramas?

https://youtu.be/P3KxN1ohiIY

Perhaps you’ve read about the Manson murders in Helter Skelter?

https://youtu.be/XwFGdnNTBnk

Manifestations of Hell abound. We see it in our nightly news.

Does anyone think the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are living in Paradise?

https://youtu.be/PeuNRaNGQr8

Perhaps some astute commenter can share their victim narrative that justifies atrocities like that. It would reveal exactly how and why evil manifests.

See: How to Stop Violence in the Middle East

Wherever you see evil, Hell is manifest for the victims.

Of course, this doesn’t fit our religious sensibilities about hell; mostly, we see hapless victims being crushed under the jackboot of avarice, invisibly due to apathy and stone-cold indifference.

In many ways, that makes it worse. The evil that men do isn’t confined to those who deserve it.

Evil Lurks Inside Each of Us

When most people observe manifest evil in the world, they solace themselves with the delusion that says:

I would never do that.

It’s a comforting lie.

One that allows us to keep our self-image of a good person, Saintly even, for those with delusions of righteousness.

I’ve peered into the evil in my own heart.

I looked at my life circumstances and asked myself, “How bad could bad get?”

The answer is below.

Before you pat yourself on the back and think you are better than me, or that you are incapable of such terrible thoughts, please consider this:

YOU ARE LYING TO YOURSELF!

If you don’t face the evil in your own heart, you will never be a force for good in the world.

Trigger Alert

Here is where everything gets difficult.

Really difficult.

What you are about to read will tear at your heart.

Brace yourself for pain, evil, the darkest of Dark.

Absorb this next section with an open heart, and you earn an A+ in Compassion.

You’ve been trigger warned.

1 in 10,000

My son is diagnosed with autism.

I once sat in an Individualized Education Program meeting where I was given a report detailing my son’s cognitive ability.

It was measured as less than the <0.01% percentile.

Let that sink in.

If you are a parent with aspirations for your child, you should feel that one easily.

I felt the deepest, darkest black hole in the entire universe consume my soul in that moment.

There was little pleasure in it.

In fact, I recall no pleasure at all.

Have you ever experienced 100% pain in every fiber of your Being?

It sucks.

Hard.

My son and I were the test subject for a cruel joke of an evil demon.

I was pissed off, and I wanted to do something about this mistake.

The Evil Demon

I chose to enter the black hole to confront the Evil Demon:

WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SEND ME A FUCKED-UP KID LIKE THAT?

I was decidedly unhappy.

The demon embraced his experiment with enthusiasm.

He felt my Qi transfer to him, sucking my life force for his consumption, like an emotional parasite, but worse.

Because he felt my presence an unexpected bonus, he told me what he did, believing it would be more painful that way — tastier, nourishing for him, but never fulfilling; that’s the demon’s paradox.

The evil of his intentions absorbed my anger and strengthened it. He was feeding on me.

Experiments to Maximize Suffering

He said,

“I created two Beings. I took the allocation of smarts for both of you, and for the lulz, I gave you all of it and left none for him.

Both conditions are rife with suffering, so both lives should generate enormous pain and rejection of life itself.

You will become a prideful and arrogant prick, in case you didn’t already notice that, and he will be toxically shamed believing his life isn’t worth living at all.

I have high hopes that you will turn completely evil.

I knew you would completely surrender life to me in a firestorm of anger and hate, and your Qi would feed me.

How do you feel about that?”

I was triggered.

The angry tirade of expletives from my anger and hatred burst forth, raging with intense searing fire.

That motherfucker was going to die, and I was going to kill him.

I was going to crush his soul — make him pay for doing this to ME.

I felt my Selfish Desire rise up, infused with heat and hate, and flood my Qi with power.

I took action.

I directed this fury toward him in a ferocious energy beam that would have melted an ice giant.

He absorbed my initial volley and laughed.

The Choice

He said,

That’s not good enough. I want more. Let me give you a choice.

I would prefer you live to continue to torturing yourself and your son.

You probably didn’t realize this, but when he looks at you, hoping to feel love, connection and warmth, instead he sees contempt in your eyes, it sends him the message he’s broken, defective, a complete reject unworthy of Life.

The world would be better off if he were gone.

It’s toxic shame, the worst, most painful sense of personal disgust imaginable.

He feels lower than low when you do that, and you do it hundreds of times a day.

Every day.

Day in, day out.

Torture, and toxic, searing pain.

I love it!

I absorb that pain, revel in it. It’s bliss, on steroids. And what’s better, the more you do it, the stronger I get, and the pain gets worse and worse.

The Power and the Glory are Mine!!!

Ahhh. That felt wonderful, just thinking about it, but I said I would offer you a choice, so here it is:

If you want, I can destroy your son, make it like he was never born. I can extinguish him from existence if you like. I can even remove the memories so it never even happened.

It would end your pain. That’s what you want, right?

That’s why you’re here!

With him gone, you won’t have anything to disturb your mind.

You will be able to leave this place in peace and have the life you were previously entitled to — you know, 2.4 kids and all.

What is your choice?

I thought about that.

In my angry state, it wasn’t a difficult choice.

Is my personal happiness more important than my son’s life?

I chose.

It was the right choice for ME.

I said, “Fuck yeah, take away this pain. Erase his defective ass and hit the fucking reset button.”

The demon dutifully complied, and my son, and everything he represents was gone.

The demon paused, and looked at me, and asked, “How do you feel?”

I checked my feelings and noted, “Good. Relieved, my burden is gone. Thank you.”

He said,

Congratulations! You just committed cold-blooded murder!

And you chose it!

You wanted him to die — and you got your wish.

Your heart is twisted with Selfish Desire, and you harnessed it to commit an egregious, unforgivable act.

You‘ve proven you’re an able apprentice.

I said, “Why can I still remember? You said you would erase the memories.”

He replied, “I erased everyone else’s memory of him, so he has no existence outside of your mind.

But I can’t remove the heart stain of Your Choices entirely, so you must live with it.”

I said, “If I’d known that was the deal, I wouldn’t have made that choice.”

He laughed,

You can’t lie to me. You would have made the same choice either way.

You’re just upset that your desires weren’t satiated.

And why would you trust a demon anyway?

Pray I don’t alter the deal further.

Feeling the betrayal, I exploded again.

This time, he was going down!

My adrenals opened, and every fiber of my being rose up for one final assault.

One decisive battle.

I sustained this hatred, beaming it intensely at him, channeling all my frustrations and waves of anger until it reached a fever pitch, and I could no longer do battle.

My Qi ran out.

He won.

He glowed with a red aura while he absorbed my Qi, bathing in it, reveling in the power I surrendered to him.

As I lay there spent, in crushed defeat, I thought, perhaps, it was over.

And end to suffering.

But no.

Then he gives me one more fact to chew on:

I’m trapped in Saṃsāra.

I need to go back and do it all over again in my next life.

And the next one, and the next one.

Endlessly.

Now, my failure was complete.

Hell is Inside, not Outside

When my heart felt the Evil Demon, I sensed his hotline to Hell.

In that moment, I realized Hell need not be a physical location.

True Hell — the worst place to exist — lies buried in the deepest region of the human heart, and you need not wait for death to experience it.

Cruelty of the Demon

Cruelty is an advanced achievement on the Dark path, synthesizing indifference (absence of love) and malice (evil intention).

I find the feeling so painful, so toxic, I know it only to know it; I never linger there.

I hope you don’t see it in your heart.

Evil lurks in the shadows.

Scrolls of the Dark Arts for Scholars

Dark Arts Instruction Manuals:

One: The Prince, by Niccolò Machiavelli. Amoral statecraft.

Two: The Art of War, by Sun Tzu, Statecraft and organized violence.

Three: The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene, who probably thought this was good literature.

Read them for knowledge, not instruction.

Unless you read them as a “What-Not-to-Do-Manual.” Then, they become virtuous.

Funny how that works.

I don’t want to leave you feeling down and dark.

Relax a moment with this video. You will feel better.

provide a meta description for "Being smart isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. It provides many advantages, but it also provides many roadblocks to success.

I always excelled at standardized tests, generally scoring in the highest 99th percentile for each category.

When I arrived at college, I set the benchmark curb in subjects including chemistry, political science, mathematics, and history, none of which were subjects that interested me that much.

I was on the dean’s list with a perfect 4.0 for 5 semesters.

I scored two 800s and a 780 on the GRE for admission to graduate school.

Do you know what that gave me?

A colossal ego and a sense of superiority that elevated me above every mere mortal I came into contact with.

I embodied asshole, like Ted Cruz.

Hell, I thought I was smarter than a guy like that.

I was simply the Best, better than all the rest. G.O.A.T. Greatest of All Time!!!

https://youtu.be/GC5E8ie2pdM

Pride over Pride can elevate you above anyone.

Never compete with another person’s ego. It’s a game of dick-measuring you can never win.

Would it surprise you that my relationships suffered, and nobody liked me very much?

It shouldn’t.

I wouldn’t have liked me either, not that I realized that. I thought I was great!

I scored in the 99th percentile on Pride

I studied with a gentlemen who obtained a perfect score on the GRE. I failed to achieve that.

He was smart; I am not, and I could immediately tell the difference.

Standardized tests only measure to a certain level. When you meet someone who goes beyond, you see just how smart people can be.

But by then, I was supremely arrogant, and set in my ways, so even that humbling setback didn’t change my lofty self evaluation.

I told myself I was probably still in the top 10. Right?

I could blow smoke up my ass with the best of them.

That was a competition I wanted to win!

It felt lovely!!!

I struggled with excessive self-esteem.

My body too

I got into powerlifting in my 20s, and in my early 30s, I got into bodybuilding.

I was never really close to being buff for a competition, but I still managed to propel my vanity into the clouds.

I was too sexy.

https://youtu.be/92NIDBiWlrY

Career Failure

Most of my professional career has been one setback after another.

I blamed everyone else of course, but I had no ability to put together teams or work toward common goals because I felt I was the only one capable of anything.

The only successes I had were things I accomplished completely on my own, which wasn’t very much.

This was entirely due to my pride and arrogance.

My amazing gifts went largely to waste due to my foibles.

I have no Desire, Right?

Not just was I supremely arrogant about my intelligence, I also believed I was more spiritually evolved that everyone else.

I cultivated a self image of an angel with no selfish thoughts, a truly “enlightened” being.

I was deluding myself.

Holy Beings worshiped me. Mere mortals were lucky to be in my presence, and I expected them to be dutifully thankful for my missives from God.

Reverence to Holy Being

It was apparent to everyone except me.

Their opinions didn’t matter much, thanks to my arrogance.

And worse, I was ignoring the signals from a force, my Selfish Desire, that pushed me to do bad things.

When I bothered to examine how I set conditions in motion to create my problems — a rare occurrence at best — I couldn’t figure out why I was doing bad things, lying to myself and others about it, and becoming upset that nobody would aid my victim story by agreeing with it.

I lived in a perpetual state of woe-is-me.

It was unpleasant.

Willful Ignorance is no solution to managing your Desires.

When I denied my selfish feelings, I put on the appearance of a Buddhist, learned some of the lingo, and practiced breath meditation a few times.

I extrapolated my few experiences to expert status and climbed to the peak of Mount Stupid, with a healthy dose of arrogance to tingle my root chakra to propel my liftoff.

Have you ever met someone like that?

Look up Jim and Tammy Bakker.

My desire and I do not exist, right?

I didn’t give up on Buddhism. I felt something was there for me, but I needed to dig a bit deeper — actually a lot deeper.

I had a book. I needed to open the cover and read it.

And start practicing.

I figured I would take a big whack at negating the “I” entirely. I read somewhere that the self is an illusion and does not exist.

Okay. If the self doesn’t exist, then that voice of Desire must be an illusion. I can merely ignore it, and it will go away.

Bumper Sticker Wisdom.

https://youtu.be/5iusMCeYTro

Let me try that and see what happens.

Unsurprisingly, It didn’t work out well.

It’s really not that much different to cast a spell on yourself to remain oblivious to Selfish Desire as it is to be aware of Selfish Desire and try to ignore it.

And realistically, Desire’s voice is hard to ignore. Like being haunted.

Hearing the signals of Selfish Desire is not enough.

I needed to manage it.

Surprisingly, I actually found a way that worked.

I promoted him to Court Jester.

https://youtu.be/dNS7wMR3kyU

Cutting a Deal

My ego, the manifestation of Selfish Desire, delights in self-serving bullshit.

I reasoned with my selfish desire. I’ll trade something I want for something he wants.

I will agree to listen to him if he agrees not to take control of the ship.

Let me make the decisions.

Consciousness.

The ringleader, cat herder, prime minister of the Parliament in my mind.

My Court Jester

I promoted him to court jester after years of failure trying to kill him, ignore him, or pretend he didn’t exist.

The voice of my ego or selfish desire, my court jester, seems content in his role.

At least he isn’t bothered, and I listen.

We established Détente.

We were no longer at war. My mind became more peaceful.

Quite honestly, I’m surprised at how well that little mental game works.

Inside out is very close to the mark. Great Movie!

https://youtu.be/k1oXx4delIY

That’s Funny!

He has a voice in the chorus, so I react to him as my court jester.

Even when he’s serious, I take his advice as humor.

Strangely enough, he doesn’t mind.

He has little or no power to motivate me, which is the purpose of the mental gymnastics to manage him.

He’s actually quite entertaining. For better or worse, he’s taken control of my sense of humor.

He’s basic.

He’s crass, rude to pretense, brutal in his honesty.

He uses candor like a knife to cut through bullshit.

I’ve learned to appreciate him.

He’s changed my laugh. It’s got a slight hint of maniacal devilishness to it.

https://youtu.be/jNWshZG9Xpc

Contemplate this: How do you keep a fool in suspense?

Have you figured it out yet?

Pride is the Jester’s Playground

I discovered “Court Jester” technique accidentally when I was working with Pride.

Pride is the playground of the ego.

My Court Jester’s fiefdom.

As worked with Pride, when I heard my own self-aggrandizing self-talk as humor rather than who I was, It was explosively funny, at least to me.

I’ve battled pride enough to identify that smoke-up-my-ass, uplifting feeling announcing his arrival.

Your Great!

Flattery will get you everywhere with Pride.

I played video games to study Pride.

I found that whenever I played skillfully I could hear the peanut gallery congratulating me particularly loudly.

As I learned to listen more closely, I heard these little scripts run with quips like.

You’re Great!

You’re Awesome!

Unbelievable. Best Ever!

You’re the MAN!!!

And I felt these feelings with great enthusiasm.

When I first noticed it, I agreed with the sentiment. Hell, yeah, I am the man!

I felt a big rush of energy near my root chakra so close to my ass that….

I’ll stop there.

That feeling. Blowing smoke up my ass. That is my signal of pride.

Ying and Yang

I don’t know why it feels that way, but I have a theory.

My root chakra is nearby between my ying and my yang — if you know what I mean.

The root chakra points straight down, connects to the earth, and to reality itself.

When I elevate myself with aggrandizing self-talk, my body loses connection to my earthen reality, lifting me up off the ground.

That tingly feeling is my body informing my mind that something is amiss.

I am emotionally blowing smoke up my ass, and the tingles feel that flow.

Wedge Salads

Despite my lofty self-evaluation, my wife found a way to penetrate my delusions and get helpful information to me.

Both sides of this little interaction are aptly captured in Season 2, episode 16 of Modern Family.

This upset my wife for years.

Because I believed I was so much smarter than everyone else, you couldn’t just tell me something.

That wouldn’t penetrate my shield of superiority.

My pride rejects all information, not directly sustaining my lofty self-opinion.

My wife’s information came from a faulty, lowly mortal who doesn’t check her facts, so I didn’t hear her words.

But the words got in, subconsciously, through the back door.

Even if I had known she was the source of information originally, I most certainly would have cast a spell upon myself to forget it.

Then, later, when this new, utterly original idea emerged from my mind, it was washed clean of its association with my wife.

Then I was a genius!

More smoke!

When Wedge Salad incidents occurred, my wife used to go bananas.

Who could blame her?

After a while, my wife stopped becoming upset.

She used to mumble “wedge salad” under her breath and giggle — which was cool with me because I could remain prideful and enjoy the smoke.

She found the wisdom to see what was happening and use it to her advantage.

She planted Wedge Salads on purpose and waited for them to ripen.

When they did, she obtained the delightful satisfaction of outwitting the master.

She beat me at my own game!

Kudos to her!!!

I admit defeat.

I bow in honor to the superior mind.

Screw you and your “holier than thou” bullshit.

I can be preachy and self-aggrandizing, particularly when my pride and arrogance grab attention.

I actually used the “smoke up my ass” test to edit this writing.

If I felt any amount of self-aggrandizement in any statement, it was removed.

My apologies if the Court Jester made it past my filter.

He’s sneaky.

There is a Season

When answers to my questions include that wonderfully uplifting feeling of smoke blown up my ass, I quickly deduce that I need to ask better questions.

I recently had an intense emotional awakening.

When the empowerment came, I asked myself: “Why did this happen now and not some other time?”

I got decent answers.

Funny ones, anyway.

Trigger Warning

What follows will appeal to men more than women, except for those rare few who can laugh at extreme male stupidity on full display.

It’s crass.

It’s totally male.

It’s totally heterosexually male in raw detail.

You’ve been warned.

Poolside Harem

The Court Jester really wanted to show that picture again, so here it is.

The Court Jester secretly hopes everyone on earth discovers through this viral post and admires Him with flattering, racy comments.

He is self-important, proud, and vain.

He also complains that Humility is overrated.

I let him show his ignorant ass, just for the giggles.

He is my court jester.

You can get away with crap like that when you write anonymously!

Realistically, if I had become empowered as a younger man, I wouldn’t have survived the hedonistic binge that would have followed.

Pardon my digression, but my court jester did entertain me with some fantastic ideas that I would have implemented as an over-empowered, testosterone-pumped young man.

I’m confident that I would have employed a harem of stunning nude call girls to inhabit my pool.

Yeah, realistically, if I really didn’t have any reason to stop myself.

I would have.

Perhaps I have them catcall to me, call me “Big Boy,” and say, “You’re the man.”

That would be fun.

The La Quinta Cove Cock demonstrates that the desire for a big cock manifests in unusual ways.

G.O.A.T.

I might even take it one step further.

Why not?

I have the money. I only live once.

I would GO for it, in a big way.

Think of the Qi flow.

Wow!

My private harem of stunning nudes (their objects, not people) would have been extremely well paid to convince me — using all feminine charms at her disposal — the following Immutable Truths:

My monstrous member goes waaaay deep and feels ecstatically overwhelming, stimulating orgasms on contact. My Wand is magic!

As a lover, I am GOAT, the greatest of all time; not just her time, not just her best, I am the best lover that any woman ever had the privilege to pleasure. (That last part mandates deep digging for a strong performance. Method actors preferred.)

She eagerly enjoys my pleasures, no matter how bizarre; if she really doesn’t like it, she must fake it perfectly every time, forever, or until I tire of her and desire a replacement. A melon softens with too many squeezes.

She gushes excitedly for her good fortune and the honor of pleasing me. She is entirely selflessly devoted to my selfish pleasure — a true religious devotee willing to worship my manhood.

I would have expected Academy Award performances, and internally, I would have fostered the illusion and lived in that warped reality.

That really shouldn’t be surprising to anyone.

If any heterosexual male denies the above, I call bullshit.

Women, men, swap parts. Imagine the characters as you please. If the image appeals, the lover is believable, and they react to you by those four principles, you would like that.

It would be something you want.

There is a reason Leonardo DiCaprio has a cult of devotees who habitually spit-polish his knob.

He likes it.

Leo, My Court Jester thinks you RULE! He wants to throw a party and invite my favorite rock bands from the 80s. It will be GLORIOUS!!!

https://youtu.be/FMbl1ntpIXQ

Leo, Seriously, my apologies for any offense. The performances you and Johnny Depp delivered in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. That’s G.O.A.T. I didn’t see you. I only saw Arnie. Remarkable. That movie deeply touched my heart.

Johnny, My wife was tempted to stuff you into the trunk of her car when you consulted a map for directions in a parking lot in Las Vegas 30 years ago. She still tells the story. She’s says your hot.

Living an illusion is very tempting. With enough money, you can afford an entourage of hangers-on, like Elvis did.

You can create the illusion of who you want to be, arrange your environment to reinforce your delusions, surround yourself with “yes” men (and women, of course), and live the dream.

Sort of.

Paying the Piper

Unfortunately, reality bats last.

Karma is inescapable.

Faking a life is a pathway to extreme suffering when the illusion can’t be sustained.

The emotional fall can be nasty, the impact hard.

Work in my house while writing. Did the Buddha in the background move this guy’s ladder?

Consequences Smonsequences

When I was young, I partied hard, drove fast, climbed dangerous mountains, and explored uncharted caves.

If financially enabled, I would have endangered myself more often, bought a motorcycle, gone skydiving, base jumping, or other adrenaline-inducing activities without regard to the risks and potential consequences.

My life was saved by financial limits on my hedonistic urges and sense of adventure at a time when I lacked the wisdom to know better.

Even past the age of recklessness, I was still a self-important, self-serving, typical young adult with no spiritual practice.

I would have squandered my power doing bad things to people — not the tiny slights of ordinary mortals — but supercharged major pain inflictors made possible by money and driven by an entitled, I-don’t-give-a-shit attitude and a sense of impunity.

I might have become president.

https://youtu.be/YqrkyXMsAjw

I would not have been ready if I had obtained power even as recently as a couple of years ago.

I can’t say I was ready when it happened, but ready or not, the fundamental practice of a Buddhist is to accept reality as it is.

I have lots of money now.

I accepted it.

It’s sweet.

It went down easy.

Still an Ass?

I won’t waste wind trying to convince you I’ve overcome my pride and arrogance.

If I have not, that would be part of the show.

If I have, then no further explanation is required."<br>

write a meta description for "If you struggle with acceptance of your Special Needs child, I strongly suggest you read that post. It will change your life.

Wherever you find darkness, the light is only one choice away.

I Hit the Lottery!

How likely is it to have a special child. Well, they measure that.

Mine is 1 in 10,000.

Talk about hitting the lottery!

Check out what I got in this deal!

Wow! I am Lucky!!!

My son never talks back to me with defiant anger.

Thankfully, he has speech, though content is limited.

It’s not content; it’s connection!

But he never angers me with willful disobedience or back-talk, so our household is peaceful.

Plus.

My son enjoys endless play and fun.

It’s like living with Peter Pan.

We play Mario Kart, Wii Golf, real Golf, we hike, walk the dog together, whatever I want, and whatever pleases him we do as a team.

We share the same interests and activities. He’s a playmate for life.

Who wouldn’t want that?

Plus. Plus.

My son can’t be spoiled.

He never becomes indulgent and entitled like a typical child would.

I can give him everything I have emotionally, and he just accepts it with gratitude and lives a happy life.

I can practice Giving, on steroids, and there are no negative consequences.

Plus. Plus. Plus.

My son loves me.

He loves me openly and completely with no reservations, doubts, or fears of abandonment.

He feels his challenges and knows he needs help.

I see the gratitude in his eyes, I feel the gratitude in his heart.

I know the Pure Love of another Being.

Plus. Plus. Plus. Plus.

Wow! Four of them!

Who wouldn’t want a son like that?

And this isn’t merely “looking at the bright side.”

There is no dark side. He and his love are entirely pure.

Exchanging Self with Other

My son is my Holy Spiritual Guide.

Every spiritual realization I have is from working with him.

I practice complete Exchanging Self with Other, abandoning my own will to fulfill his.

I don’t merely try to “put myself in his shoes,” that’s only part way.

I don’t imagine what he wants, weigh it against what I want, and try to compromise. That’s half-assed.

While consideration is essential for Kindness, a virtue, but it falls short of the mark I set for this practice.

I ignore what I Want as useless information. (Difficulty 10) This never gets easier… well, maybe a little, but you never master it.

I give him 100% of my undivided attention for as long as I can. Completely undivided. (Difficulty 5) It’s just focused concentration, something you should always practice.

I determine what he wants, exercising my wisdom on appropriateness, and then I practice Giving. (Difficulty: Currently 0, Previously 10). This area improves dramatically with practice. It’s also just good parenting.

This practice is both easy and challenging, exhausting and exhilarating if you do it moment-by-moment.

I don’t exchange once for a moment, go watch a movie, and come back to see what’s going on. That’s not it.

It takes focused concentration until I permit him to practice Mario Kart or engage in some other activity by himself briefly while I recharge.

As a side benefit, he demonstrates the Qi value of Play, warming my heart.

I find the practice so rewarding, Qi inducing, that I find the times of recharge are fewer and shorter.

That happens with practice. Everything gets better.

I can’t spoil him, so I can practice whenever I want.

He likes it.

How Love Transforms the World

Love is a Choice.

Why did the deepest darkest night consume my soul?

I chose no.

I didn’t want an autistic child.

The Heart of Evil, the Darkest of Dark

Why did feelings of elation arise, like I won the lottery?

I chose yes,

I wanted an autistic child.

I encountered the fact about my child: He is 1 in 10,000.

I had a choice to make about how to interpret that fact and weave it into the narrative of my life.

I could choose to reject my child, and go to the Dark Side, assisted by victim-enabling groups confirming my life-sucks narrative.

I could choose to accept my child, completely and wholeheartedly exactly as he is, not wanting him to be any different, and I go to the Light Side.

Neither interpretation is being forced upon me.

I have the power to choose.

And so do you.

Which would you choose?

Love empowers you to choose how you see the World.

Everything else follows.

That’s Power!

Choose a World of Love, and you Live in a World of Love.

Choose Love!!!

It’s Glorious!

Fundamental Truth of the Mind

Every belief in your head begins as a seed planted in Body Reality.

Some information in the outside world enters your awareness.

Philosophers call these Brute Facts or, more simply, Data.

From there, you have complete control to interpret the meaning of that fact.

write a meta description for "Lamrim Meditations

Practicing Lamrim Meditations changed my life. It can change yours, too.

The New Meditation Handbook from Tharpa Publications, production of the New Kadampa Tradition:

The New Meditation Handbook is a practical guide to meditation that teaches us how to make ourself and others happy by developing inner peace, and in this way making our lives more meaningful. Without inner peace there is no real happiness at all. Problems, suffering and unhappiness do not exist outside the mind; they are feelings and thus part of our mind. Therefore, it is only by controlling our mind that we can permanently stop our problems and make ourself and others truly happy. The twenty-one Buddhist meditation practices presented in this book are actual methods to control our mind and experience lasting inner peace. This extremely practical guide is an indispensable handbook for those seeking happiness and meaning in their lives.

This one book, more than any other, is responsible for changing my life.

I also own the three-volume set The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, an extended study on Lamrim.

I’m into it.

https://youtu.be/6A7J3-VacLo

The books are merely a guide. It’s the practice, it’s doing the meditations that changes your heart and your life.

Practice, practice, practice.

Buying the book merely for intellectual knowledge is a waste of time.

Understanding gets you nowhere.

Feelings lead to your destination.

The original Lamrim sequence was prepared by the Buddhist Master Atisha (982–1054). It was later updated by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) and translated by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso (1931–2022).

https://youtu.be/kdZQzPSNppw

Geshe Kelsang Gyatso- 1931–2022, RIP. You were the bridge between our cultures. I owe you everything. I felt your Love. Thank you.

I request one last Blessing: Please, find me in the Bardo and guide me on my journey. I will navigate by the Power of your Radiant Light.

https://youtu.be/rcs13D7uLHA

The Void

Several years ago, I arranged my life to spend several hundred hours in float tanks practicing Lamrim in total sensory deprivation.

I learned to hear the distant streams in my mind through years of meditation practice.

The voices and forces I animate dramatically are both the raging rivers and the quiet voices, barely noticeable, difficult to tune.

I had time to meditate in sensory isolation — lots of time. I developed a sensitive radio dial.

It’s a practiced skill, nothing more.

Like hitting golf balls.

https://youtu.be/qV8A49GvqMw

I marvel at the Power of the mind. Anyone who devotes time to practice can achieve this.

I’m not the first. The Buddha achieved this 2,500 years ago and went way, way beyond.

He taught meditation.

The monks who’ve been following his footsteps ever since, same thing.

You are more powerful than you realize.

Much more powerful.

Enter Zen from There

An apt analogy comes from a Zen Buddhist story.

Master and disciple sit in meditation. The Master was calm, peaceful, and open to life. The disciple was uneasy, his mind aflutter.

The disciple asks, “Master, How do I enter Zen?”

The Master sits and listens. Meanwhile, the disciple’s mind is agitated by impatience for an answer.

Photo by Carlo Trolese on Unsplash

The Master finally says, “Do you hear the mountain stream?”

The disciple turned his attention away from his disturbing thoughts and listened for the distant, faint sounds of cascading water.

He observed.

He became peaceful.

His mind fell silent as he focused on observation.

After some time and focused concentration, the disciple heard the stream.

Excited, the disciple exclaims, “Yes! Master, I can hear the stream.”

The master replied. “Enter Zen from there.”

(the end)

Jack Kornfield, The Roots of Buddhist Psychology was Buddhism 101 for me. I’ve listened to all 9 hours many, many times!

My Most Challenging Meditation

One of the virtues you meditate on is called Equanimity. Scholars come up with all manner of odd interpretations, but it’s basically about balance.

Ideally, you want to hold all people in your heart Equally.

No favoritism.

It sounds like an admirable goal to aspire to, but when you get down to the mechanics of it, it’s really, really hard.

My Most Hated Enemy

I no longer have enemies, but I did at one time.

Many people collect enemies like marbles they can use to weigh down their Hearts.

When I thought about this person, all manner of hatred and bile would spring forth, flooding me with negativity, and that sickly stench of Death would poison my heart.

I would meditate on my victim story, beating this person mercilessly in my mind.

Over and over until my heart turned to stone.

It wasn’t wise.

No, No, a Thousand Times No

My Equanimity meditations prompted me to examine this behavior and try to turn Darkness into Light.

I decided to meditate on my enemies' good qualities and accomplishments and look for admirable items.

HOLY CRAP! NO WAY!!!

Well, my mind did provide some resistance to the process.

A little.

For a second or two.

Okay, maybe for months….

War was raging in my heart.

The Lynchpin

When I won that battle, my heart cracked open, like it broke free from its chains.

I released that enemy and all my other enemies ran to the door.

Yes, I still had work to do, calling up each one, admiring them, and setting them free.

There is no get-out-of-jail-free card. You still have to do the work.

But once it’s done, a pure heart, no longer dragged down by those marbles of hate, is Life’s greatest reward.

provide a meta description "The Flow of Power

I need to engage your imagination to establish a shared vocabulary to help you feel what I feel. If I fail at this, I will lose you, and I don’t want that.

Imagine your body is a conduit for energy flow. Perhaps it’s a pipe that water flows through.

I often imagine it like a copper electrical wire with many individual strands, each flowing with electrical power, wrapped and intertwined.

The Tibetan Buddhists invested 1,500 years and the lives of countless monks to develop highest yoga tantra visualizations, far more intricate — and delightful to engage in.

See: Mahamudra Tantra.

Imagine the flow of energy through this conduit — Qi, if you like — as the sum of all your personal power that makes you want to do something.

The emphasis is on the doing.

Qi = Do.

It’s passion.

It’s Go energy, the feeling that pushes you to chase your dreams.

The source may be love, relationships, your religious beliefs, your committed intentions, and of course, money.

While it’s possible to have strongly flowing Qi without money (monks do it), for many of us, money is a huge component of the flow of life.

Concepts of fairness of distribution aside, it is what it is.

Pink Floyd is always worth a minute or two of your time.

https://youtu.be/-0kcet4aPpQ

Money is a Pecker Pump

Particularly for men, when I feel flush with cash, I feel strong, vibrant, and fully alive; when I’m broke, I feel weak, deflated, and, dare I say, flaccid.

Rich men are attractive to women for multiple reasons.

Selfish Desire for unlimited spending money is certainly part of it, but the more powerful reason is that rich men often have powerfully flowing Qi.

These men are vibrant, fun-loving, charismatic people magnets.

Who wouldn’t want to be around that?

Another Brick in the Wall

We all experience some baseline level of Qi based on personality, experiences, and life circumstances.

Before my change, my Qi was normal and as healthy as one can expect in a capitalist system that drains worker’s souls.

I didn’t struggle to get out of bed, I enjoyed some entertainments and pleasures, and I sustained good health. I was a standard brick in the wall.

Low Qi me, prior to empowerment, probably after stuffing myself at a Las Vegas Buffet. Love those jowls and six-pack abs. I believe I looked better when I was younger. Oh, how the Mighty have fallen.

Pink Floyd again.

https://youtu.be/5IpYOF4Hi6Q

My Qi was on a life-sustaining trickle.

When I got the news of my good fortune, my 20 amp wire got hit with 100 amps of power.

I touched a live wire, and I lit up.

Euphoria.

The Body is a Qi Conduit

Unfortunately, if you pull 100 amps of current through a 20 amp wire, it melts.

Physical effects accompany the increased energy flow.

A strongly flowing Qi, or any sustained strong emotion, also has physical effects.

My heart-rate sped up, which wasn’t surprising at first, prompting me to stop all caffeine intake, but in the weeks and months since, it still races with increased adrenaline.

I like it.

Abandonment of Financial Distress

My adrenals were accustomed to frequent pounding by fearful thoughts from financial stress. That is the fate of every struggling worker in a capitalist system (except in Socialist Europe, where they don’t.)

Financial fear thoughts arose out of habit, but since I stopped energizing fear with a feeling of truth or certainty, my mind dismissed the thoughts as meaningless information.

Without the energy to bring the thoughts to conscious attention, they slowly faded away.

I no longer hear or feel the Siren’s Song of financial distress.

That’s a plus.

Great!

My adrenals didn’t get a break though.

As the stress thoughts faded, every latent thought of fun, newly energized with intense Qi flow, began dominating my mind.

When my mind serves up non-stop thoughts of fun and excitement — and the only thing stopping me from acting is the doing — then my body responds with a constant flow of adrenaline.

It feels great!

https://youtu.be/X9gYkLX53L4

Recapturing my Youth

I started craving higher-energy foods in smaller amounts, and I lost about 20% of my body weight over a four-month span.

I look and feel like a young man again.

Even now, I struggle to eat enough. I don’t like feeling weighed down and slowed up.

Previously, I didn’t mind a Friday evening gut-buster with a 14-ounce rib-eye eased down by cheesecake, coffee, and ice cream (lubricate the slopes, right?)

If it weighed me down, so what? It isn’t like I had anything else to do or the Qi to do it. (See results in body photo above.)

Now, I recoil at the thought of a 2,500+ calorie blowout. That would stop me from having fun afterward.

Screw that.

The Beatles were popular when I was born. I’m old.

Home scale extremes 194 to 152

Diet and Nutrition

The internet is a cesspool of misinformation on health and diet.

Let me share a few simple observations that don’t require complex bullshit to understand.

Calories in minus Waste (defecation) equals calories available for Consumption (burning) in metabolic processes.

If Consumption does not equal calories available, the body will store some as fat and expel the rest as waste.

If consumption exceeds the calories available, the body will first try to be more efficient with what comes in, reducing waste. This is why restricted calorie diets often fail.

If the body can no longer extract useful calories from food, it will burn fat.

If you eat carbohydrates, your body produces a host of different digestive enzymes than if you consume fat and protein. Changing gears from carbohydrate digestion to fat digestion is very uncomfortable, which causes most people to abandon their diet. Staying in fat-burning mode all the time is preferred, even if all the fat comes from food.

Once you start burning fat, you don’t want to eat much food, particularly if stored fat burning is what you are attempting. Every calorie you consume is a calorie not taken out of your stored fat.

Fasting is good for the body. It burns fat and allows the body to remove toxins, generally through urine if you drink a lot of water, but sweating happens too.

Excessive fasting causes muscular degeneration, but that is way, way down the road. You won’t lose much muscle on a 5-day fast. I’ve done several. Don’t fear fasting because you believe you will lose your muscle mass.

You can’t drink too much water. You will pee it out.

Electrolyte depletion is a thing. Add salts to your water occasionally. It’s not as big of a thing as diet gurus make it out to be.

Hunger is a signal from the body that the stomach has finished digesting the last meal. How that signal is interpreted is completely up to you. Appetite is a phantom of the imagination.

A Hunger signal can be safely ignored.

Fear of Death shouldn’t be part of it.

How and What I eat now

When I was started college, the four food groups were candy, Coke, alcohol, and caffeine. I consume none of those today.

I east mostly eggs, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and greens, olives of all kinds, and yogurt. That’s it.

I love foods with natural water. Eighty Percent of my foods are found in the produce section of the supermarket.

Hat Tip Tony Robbins.

Fruits and vegetables provide more energy than proteins. I’m biased toward energy since my heart races much faster than before.

Bread and grains always make me drowsy. I refuse to eat them.

Basmati rice is okay, but starchy rices or raw starches of any kind put me to sleep.

Sugar, or foods loaded with processed sugars and fats cause flushing and sometimes nausea. I avoid those like the plague.

I eat 6 or more times per day, often in 100–500 calorie bursts. Rarely do I eat more than 500 calories at one time.

I only schedule eating if it’s with my family.

I never eat out of habit.

I never struggle with portion control.

Sorry, I think I will pass….

Feel the Body

My body improved because I was strongly motivated to improve it.

I maintained a disciplined habit of exercise for most of my adult life, but I needed to rely on reminders of health or vanity to motivate myself to continue — at least, I knew that much about self-direction.

But when motivation is weak, the results are similarly weak, but it was better than nothing at all.

When this change came, I suddenly found a thousand reasons to go to the gym and work out.

The workouts became painless and energizing.

I had to be wary of pushing myself beyond my aging body’s limits.

The mind was willing.

It was fun again!

I remembered those intense sessions doing heavy squats with my workout partner from 30 years ago.

I craved that feeling of complete physical exhaustion and deep personal satisfaction caused by pushing my physical limits.

Pink Floyd reminds us that making yourself Comfortably Numb through drugs or emotional eating is literally a dead end.

https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog

Chakra Flow

I did notice several unusual physical effects that I can best explain using the concepts of Chakras, the language developed by Indian mystics from antiquity to communicate their internal subjective states.

I hope I don’t lose you here. Chakra’s aren’t something you either believe in or you don’t.

There is a detectable physical phenomenon that begs for an explanation.

If you don’t like this one, I’m open to hearing yours.

Failure to believe in Chakras doesn’t wish away the effect.

I assure you I feel everything I describe.

The Chakra system provides a useful framework for conveying these internal subjective feelings.

I use Chakras to tell you where to look and why for certain feelings or signs you should pay careful attention to.

There is no other way to cross the Ultimate Divide.

Qi Cleanse

When the intense Qi burst hit me, I lost my appetite. I attribute it to the extreme activation of the chakra in my solar plexus, pointing right at my stomach.

Over a few weeks, I had episodes of nausea and night sweats as my body expelled every flesh toxin I had accumulated over the years.

I changed sheets a lot.

I scheduled a checkup, but the symptoms, which weren’t in any way painful, had subsided. My GI doctor gave me a clean bill of health.

Prior to this experience, I had no idea that powerful Qi flow could, in and of itself, cleanse the body.

Good to know.

Give yourself a reason to live, and you will live a longer, healthier life.

Another valuable fact.

Simple.

Cool!

I am thankful for the years of heart meditations to prepare my body for the new flow, or it might have killed me.

My heart rate is higher, a necessity to fuel the body to execute on the Go energy coming from the Qi flow.

My blood pressure is low. The moment-to-moment experience of my body is stronger, like the pumped-up feeling after a workout, but all the time.

I feel young again.

Pink Floyd again. Careful, I should be locked away. The Lunatic is in my head.

https://youtu.be/BhYKN21olBw

Fever!

Since my visions of the future were activated so strongly, the chakra in my forehead heated up, and it still runs a bit hot.

For weeks, I reveled in the relief of cold compresses on my forehead.

WTF is that?

A stress reaction of mine is to contract the muscles of my forehead and face.

Frowny face, with 11s.

=:(

It's frustrating because people react to what they see, and my forehead says, “He’s unhappy.”

People think I’m upset when I’m jubilant, bouncing off-the-walls happy.

As I coped with the tingly sensations and the heat from the forehead chakra activation, I secretly hoped it would flatten those 11s.

No dice.

Did you notice I just attempted to justify my desire for botox to the world?

Vanity.

~~Giggles~~

In truth, the center of chakra burn is actually about 1" higher than my brow, so it’s just off the top of the image above.

Fortunately, no discoloration or skin irritation.

It can happen.

Stigmata Burns

From a Christian perspective, I might interpret this one as a sign of my Jesus Juice.

Since empowerment, I’ve had notable tingling and discoloration in the center of my favored right hand, similar to those who experience Christian Stigmata.

Except that mine wasn’t caused by an extreme empathetic reaction to the Christ story — near as I can tell.

Their experience is valid, their Compassion Flowing so strongly through their Hearts, that their Empathy for Christ becomes complete.

They are Christ. They experience His pain.

It manifests in the real world.

They are spiritual Masters.

Pink Floyd again. Hey You, Can you feel what Christ felt?

Your Guess is as Good as Mine.

For mine, which thankfully don’t bleed, I don’t actually have a clue. No ability to run an experiment, gather data, interpret results.

I don’t produce this on demand.

I observed four things:

No previous discoloration.

Coincidental arising implies cause and effect.

Persistence for long periods (It’s been months).

An ongoing phenomenon.

The sensation is so strong it warps and discolors the skin.

Prescription medications help with the symptoms, and it doesn’t bother me or my doctor.

It’s just one of those odd things that makes you go, hmmm…

Image of author’s right hand. Does anyone want to palm-read me? Ignore the index finger cut that’s healing. That was a moment of foolish inattention.

Of course, I do have my own theory about it.

I’m right-handed.

My right hand directs my Qi in the physical world.

I suddenly channel an outsized power to influence events in the world, and that Qi power flows out of me through the palm of my hand.

Interesting only to me: My golf short game, which relies on feel in my right hand, has been particularly sharp since Empowerment. Of course, I practice a bit more too.

A spot on the outside of my left foot was delayed by a few weeks. Do you have a theory on this one?

Left foot stigmata burn

Here’s what I chose to believe.

Chakras exit through the palms and the soles and in your Erogenous zones. ~~Giggles~~

The burn shouldn’t be on top. It should be underneath.

Perhaps this is all a delusion, and I have a skin rash that’s spreading.

Computer says no.

https://youtu.be/0n_Ty_72Qds

David Walliams, Matt Lucas, You are comic geniuses! I’ve loved every moment of every performance you’ve ever done. The scene of Desire for a Senior Citizen is nearly too painful to watch I laugh so hard.

My doctor says no, too. I cover all my bases.

Louise Hay provided me with a clue.

The empowerment I feel moves through my family.

My left foot is my least coordinated, least-used appendage. Therefore, it is the weakest and needs the most support.

My wife’s Qi flow is also vital.

In the weeks following the initial empowerment, the connection between us manifested.

She is pouring her Qi into me.

It enters me through the burn in the photo, connecting to my weakest limb, where I need the most support.

I’m witnessing the initial burn of connection. When my body adjusts, it may go away. (Since I began this draft weeks ago, it has nearly cleared up.)

She supports me.

It’s great!

On second thought, since our connection can’t be severed, the mark may never go away.

Isn’t that a lovely way to look at it?

So, is my theory correct?

I don’t know. I’m spitballing here.

Consider this.

Believing it’s True pleases me; it doesn’t hurt anyone, it makes me closer to my wife, and nobody can prove otherwise.

Why shouldn’t I believe that?

It’s like believing in angels or fairies.

It pleases me.

Dry Mouth, Tingly Throat

This work (and the related one I linked to at the beginning) gestated in my mind for several weeks — I let my subconscious take care of that. I fed it the books it wanted but let it do its own thing.

Your subconscious mind can become your servant if you read the user’s manual.

You can decode the green gibberish in the Matrix.

Eventually, the physical symptoms of dry mouth and tingly throat told me that my expression chakra was fully opened.

It was time for the written Emergence.

I arranged life to allow the inspiration and craft to cycle without interruption until the first full draft was complete.

I left my house rarely. I did nothing else.

I drank a lot of water.

During the most intense week, channeling the deepest emotional pieces, I lost another 3 pounds because my stomach was upset and my Adam’s apple felt swollen.

I’m not a particular fan of this feeling, but I gladly pay the Polyhymnia’s fee.

Polyhymnia’s voice is fresh, but she recoils at any trace of ego and falls silent.

Introvert to Extrovert

I’ve noticed significant changes in my personality since my empowerment.

The most notable is that I am no longer a devoted introvert. Previously, I was a loner, probably due to the fact I was an insufferably arrogant asshole.

Since I woke up, I suddenly found I want to be around people and Give to them. Not money but time, attention, Love.

Unsurprisingly, people respond well to that!

It’s making me an extrovert.

Not something I expected.

Precision of Dress

Previously, I didn’t care what people thought about me or my appearance. I paid no attention to fashion or my dress.

I wasn’t awkwardly dressed (most of the time), but I just didn’t care.

After my experience, I suddenly had a strong desire to see precision when I looked in the mirror.

Not for anyone else but for myself.

My mind feels very ordered and sharp, and I feel compelled to express that on the outside to reflect what’s happening on the inside.

Again, it was not something that I expected.

Of course, precision dress with a snappy style appeals to people, which feeds into my becoming more of an extrovert.

Funny how that happens.

Richard Prior (1940–2005) RIP. Loved your Work!

Brewster’s Millions

Richard Prior made a hilarious movie in 1985 about a poor man who stood to inherit a large fortune, but for one task: he had to spend a huge fortune without acquiring any assets in a short period of time.

By the movie's end, he has lost all desire to spend money, which puts the remaining fortune in good hands.

In short, he needed to be emotionally prepared for the financial windfall to manage it properly.

No Money, No Problem

I contemplated that movie’s lesson often after Empowerment, and believe it or not, no spending spree.

Yes, more spending occurred than before, but we mainly acquired what my family previously wanted with immediacy. No deferring ductwork or removing grass from my yard.

We didn’t go on an aggressive program of lifestyle upgrades.

That was key.

Like most people, I previously managed my finances by spending everything that came in to create a lifestyle.

Post Empowerment, the inevitable and unending pull to spend and up our lifestyle concerned me.

I committed to no purchases over $10,000 to curb the urge. Of course, I violated that almost immediately when I bought my wife the Jeep she’s been wanting for several years, but that’s it. No more.

So far…

I still drive my white low-mileage 2003 Lexus LS worth less than $10,000.

Everyone else’s car is more expensive, which makes them cool.

I’m invisible to Pride. Cool owners don’t see me.

I cherish my car. Her name is Pearl.

She’s cute.

She brings joy to my heart.

I don’t want a new Bentley. I don’t want attention.

I’m not motivated by conspicuous consumption.

Marie Kondo I salute you!

https://youtu.be/rAC4sprfqgU

It’s all about my son

So where does all that money go?

Simple. It pays for anything and everything my special needs son wants to do.

All of it.

Where would it be better spent?

Attachment to Power

The clearest and most obvious sign that I am not enlightened is the fact that I am attached to my newfound power.

If, by some disaster, the annuity which empowers my Qi was lost — I think that would suck.

It would suck comprehensively, in every way, swallowing my Qi in the process. (It wouldn’t be that bad, but I certainly don’t want to lose it.)

I like feeling empowered. I do not wish to go back to feeling un-empowered.

I have a preference.

My preference would be to keep getting the firehose of cash sprayed on me for life, like I do now.

That preference. That is my attachment.

How strong is my preference? How much do I want to suffer?

They come in equal measures.

Enlightened, I am not.

Time is the Ultimate Limitation

When you overcome your issues with money, you come to see that Time is the limitation you can never overcome.

You only have so much time, and you never know when yours is up.

One of the most hauntingly beautiful songs about time comes from Jim Croce. Don’t go look up the lyrics. Listen to the music.

Of course, any fans of Pink Floyd will remember that they addressed this issue too.

provide meta description "Mommy Dearest

For much of the twentieth century, mommies were demonized in American Culture.

https://youtu.be/tUkE9qaVgmo

Perhaps it’s deserved, perhaps not.

Hating on mommy has certainly become popular. 

And anywhere you find sad stories of parental abuse, particularly about mothers, you will find a mass fandom of mommy-haters piling on.

I had issues, like everyone else

I didn’t always get along with my own mother. Like all teens, I went from completely dependent at age 14 to completely independent at age 18.

That transition is not without conflict and lingering hard feelings.

Difficulties with parents are universal. Creating a victim narrative in which mommy was terrible has become far too common.

https://youtu.be/39zOZ8ET9rc

My mother was a gem compared to others.

The worst mommy story I’ve heard

I spent about two years attending a therapy group starting at age 30. One of the women in that group had a particularly disturbing parent experience.

From the age of 4 up through about 12, her father would abuse her sexually.

She remembered one night when she was perhaps 4 or 5; her father led her down the hallway to her bedroom for what she knew was going to be abuse.

On her way past the master bedroom, she caught her mother’s eyes.

At that moment, she realized her mother knew what was going on and chose not to stop it.

She speculated on her mother’s reasons, and none of the answers she came up with were pleasing or comforting.

Her father was abusing her with the full knowledge and consent of her mother.

That’s a lot to digest.

She forgave her mother

The reason this woman was in therapy was ostensibly to find a way to accept what happened to her in her youth.

She could have taken many tacks.

She chose to work toward complete forgiveness because she realized anything less would leave a stain on her own heart, and she didn’t want that.

Over the course of 18 months, I witnessed a lot of yelling, crying, and intense emotional release.

But she made it.

She completely forgave her mother in her heart. She even forgave her father.

She came to believe that despite all her mother’s mistakes, he mother was still her mother, and she owed her life to her, and if for no other reason, that was enough to forgive her for everything.

How bad can bad get?

Is your story worse than that?

Did your mother do something even worse?

Do you want to be in competition with others to see if yours is the worst possible trauma that any mother could ever inflict on a child?

Sorry, but you will not win that competition.

https://youtu.be/XLQpTp2_u-U

Trauma stories are not competitions.

Whatever happened to you, it was undoubtedly bad. 

It’s also not important.

Are you aghast at that statement?

Are you rushing to the comments to tell me that I don’t understand?

That indignation is what’s keeping you trapped in anger, resentment, and despair.

It’s hurting your mother. If she’s still alive, she knows you carry this anger and resentment.

But it’s hurting you even more in ways you may not be aware of.

Whatever your mother did to you, it pales in comparison to what you are doing to yourself.

Why should you forgive your mother?

When I met the woman I described previously, I was doing group therapy work to deal with my own past traumas.

I had far less to forgive, and mostly it was nonsense I blew out of proportion.

Much of what I believed happened to me was my own interpretation of events rather than anything objectively bad.

I spun a yarn of victim nonsense, lived in that narrative, and made myself unhappy.

It was my own doing.

When I stopped attending this group, I correctly surmised that I had forgiven my mother for everything.

I even asked her forgiveness for my bad behavior.

Imagine that.

https://youtu.be/wEoUAlxQlgM

This came to serve me later when I began practicing Tibetan Buddhism and working with Lamrim.

In The New Meditation Handbook from Tharpa Publications, meditation number eight is Recognizing That All Living Beings Are Our Mothers.

It’s a foundational meditation, as most of the subsequent meditations build on the realizations and feelings generated by thinking about the love of your mother.

Lamrim is the stages on the path to enlightenment. No advanced Buddhist practitioner maintains animus toward their mother.

Any practitioner who has mommy issues overcomes them because it’s essential to moving forward on the journey.

This isn’t only true for Buddhists.

If you want to grow and mature emotionally and spiritually, you need to forgive your mother—not halfway, not conditionally, not with reservations.

Complete and total forgiveness.

You will know you are there when you feel compelled to tell your mother and ask her to forgive you for being angry all these years.

Your mother’s Love for you

When your mother realized she was pregnant with you, she could have evicted you at the cost of your life.

Laws on the matter notwithstanding, aborting fetuses has been a practice since antiquity, and your mother could have aborted you.

Photo by Aditya Romansa on Unsplash

You were a guest that she allowed to stay in her own body, despite the pains and the problems a developing baby entails.

If she had made a different choice, you would not be reading these words now.

That isn’t conjecture; it’s a fact.

If you were homeless and destitute and someone invited you into their home and provided you with food and shelter, you would consider that person kind and generous.

Your mother is due the same consideration.

Absent your victim story, you would feel the need to express gratitude for your very existence.

When you were in your mother’s womb, she protected you more carefully than a precious jewel. In every situation, she thought about your safety.

She consulted doctors, exercised, at special foods, and nurtured you for nine months.

She was careful not to do anything that would have damaged the development of your physical and mental faculties.

And even if she fell short in some regard, she made sure you survived.

Photo by Nathan Dumlao on Unsplash

At the time of your birth, your mother experienced great pain, and even during childbirth, your well-being was foremost on her mind.

When you were born, you looked wretched, but she saw only beauty and loved you dearly.

You were born completely helpless, unable to understand language or even recognize your mother. Without her devotion and care, you would have perished in agony in a matter of hours or days.

She fed you, bathed you, clothed you, responded to your tears, and comforted you.

She wiped the filth from your body. Have you ever changed a diaper? Do you think she did that for fun?

Even when your mother had problems, she always showed you loving expressions, called you sweet names, and sang lullabies to put you to sleep.

If she had forgotten you even for a short time, you might have died or been disabled for life.

Each day of your life, your mother was there to rescue you from disaster, and she always considered circumstances from the point of view of your safety and well-being.

When you were small, your mother would not sleep well, vigilant and ready to awaken at the slighted sound of your crying.

As you grew older, your mother taught you how to eat, drink, speak, sit, and walk.

She sent you to school and encouraged you to do good things in life.

Whatever you’ve attained in your life is due to the foundation of goodness she provided you.

https://youtu.be/FwqXzkf6gcE

Your mother’s foibles

Your mother was not perfect.

Neither are you.

Are you holding her to a standard you don’t meet? Many people do.

If you have an entrenched victim story, your mind has already flooded with objections.

Your mother did terrible things to you.

“My mother did [insert your trauma here].”

You have impugned her motives.

“My mother was terrible because [insert your nefarious reasons here].”

You have negative characterizations of her.

“My mother is an awful person because [insert your list of her flaws here].”

You might even get others to agree with all your points. Your mother may even be in jail, found guilty by a jury of her peers.

No matter how justified your victim story is, if you cling to it, you will suffer.

It’s really that simple.

Anger, Resentment, Spite, and Retaliation

The following is adapted from How to Solve Our Human Problems by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.

Anger is a disturbed mind that identifies an animate or inanimate object, finds it unattractive, exaggerates its bad qualities, and wishes to harm it.

You’ve identified your mother as the problem.

You don’t want to be around her, so you find her unattractive.

You focus exclusively on what you perceive as her bad traits and qualities.

You feel your mother deserves the emotional pain your negativity inflicts upon her. You may even wish bad things were to happen to her because you feel she deserves it.

You are angry at your mother.

Spite is when anger has hardened into Resentment, and the person wishes to speak harshly.

Do you speak harshly about your mother to others? Is your spite an admirable trait?

Resentment is formed when anger is sustained without forgetting it.

You resent your mother.

If resentment is sustained for long periods, the desire to retaliate arises.

Anger and resentment prompt people to retaliate against those perceived to be the cause of harm; in your case, you want to hurt your mother.

The desire to retaliate often causes people to expose themselves to unnecessary troubles merely for petty revenge.

Have you done anything to get back at your mother? Do you want to? Do you feel good about that?

Anger is Destructive

Anger makes everyone afflicted engage in bad actions that lead to untold suffering.

Anger blocks any progress on the path to spiritual liberation, leading to unhappiness or depression.

Anger is a painful state of mind.

Anger makes everyone tense and uncomfortable.

Anger makes it difficult to sleep, and even when sleep comes, it isn’t restful or refreshing.

Anger makes it difficult to enjoy activities, other than cruelty, inflicting pain on your mother for its own delight.

Anger motivates action without deliberation. Angry people often lose their freedom of choice, driven to action without concern for consequence.

Angry people often die alone, having pushed away everyone who was close to them.

Are you so angry at your mother that you want her to die alone, thinking you hate her?

Be careful what you wish for because it might happen to you.

Rage and Aggression

Anger is like fire. It starts as a spark, and if fed with confirming thoughts, and given enough time, it grows into an inferno.

Anger becomes rage, and like large fires in nature, it can grow out of control and consume everything and everyone in its path.

Rage is uncontrolled anger.

Aggression is an increase in anger that motivates the desire to harm others either physically or verbally.

Rage and aggression lead to violence.

How far are you willing to let your anger go?

Do you like the portrait of who you have become due to your anger against your mother?

Maybe you hide it well on the outside but on the inside…

Perhaps it’s time for a change, don’t you think?

How to forgive your mother

To forgive your mother, you must want to. You must see some advantage in it.

The last several sections of this writing were intended to provide you with motivation in that regard.

If you still don’t want to forgive your mother, I suggest you read it again.

If you wish to burn your insides in the fire of anger until you embody the evil you detest, then that is your choice.

Stop reading here.

You will never know the joy of your mother’s love again.

Even if your mother is deceased, if you forgive her, she will love you from Heaven.

Stop feeding the anger beast

The first step is to stop adding to your anger and resentment by reminding yourself of all the things you perceive wrong with your mother.

Stop telling yourself your victim story.

If you do tell yourself your victim story, don’t blindly agree with it and reinforce its certainty.

Learn to undermine the certainty of your victim story.

Ask questions like:

“Is that a fact, or just my opinion?” Recognize that it’s an opinion, something you can change.

“Even if that’s true, is it worth the pain I cause myself?” Recognize that it is not.

“Is there another way to view the situation?” There is always another way to interpret what happened. Your current interpretation is the most negative one possible. That’s why you chose to believe it.

“What would my mother’s point of view be?” Have you ever pondered this? Most people don’t.

Would your mother agree with your woe-is-me narrative? If so, then she is sorry and wants your forgiveness. If not, then you should consider how she might view things.

Even if she is crazy or delusional, at least you would demonstrate empathy with her point of view.

Otherwise, that beast of anger will eat you from the inside out.

Put out the fire of anger when it’s a spark

Buddhist practitioners learn the value of squelching anger at the earliest possible moment before it becomes a raging fire.

Watch your mind. As soon as it becomes disturbed, you should remind yourself of the many faults of anger as described above.

Whenever you start ruminating on your mother’s faults and blaming her for your problems, you should remember that fault-finding, blaming, and anger only create more suffering for yourself and those around you.

You should divert your attention to something else—anything else, but preferably a list of your mother’s good traits.

Create a list of your mother’s good and admirable traits

She doesn’t have any, right?

Did I just read your mind?

Anger creates mental barriers to anything that extinguishes the flames.

Anger far prefers to go through the list of your mother’s faults, the terrible things you blame her for, and anything else negative you can heap on her.

Thoughts about your mother’s good or admirable traits would be a wet blanket extinguishing the flame.

But that’s what you need—and should be what you want.

Once you have your list, meditate on it.

Keep the list handy, and read it multiple times per day.

Add to it as you think of more admirable traits. Anything, no matter how small, is worthy of writing down and remembering—like you did with your list of her foibles.

(In case you didn’t notice, this is also how to rid your mind of enemies of all kinds in your family and outside. Read the post linked below for more info.)

https://youtu.be/3V4PM1oL7Xs

Make anger your enemy, not your mother

Since you have much anger inside you bottled up as resentment, you need to detach this anger from your mother and direct it onto itself.

This way, you can fight fire with fire, setting a backfire in your heart to prevent further damage.

This has the side benefit of awakening the desire to rid yourself of the anger as quickly as possible.

If you ingested poison, you would act immediately to rid your body of it. The emotional poison of anger shouldn’t be treated any differently.

Admit that you want your mother’s love

Anger arises whenever you don’t get what you want or find yourself in an undesirable situation.

You are angry at your mother because you want something from her you don’t feel you are getting.

The reality of life is that you can’t always get what you want. Getting angry about that won’t help. In fact, it makes it less likely you will obtain what you desire.

You want your mother’s love and support, like she provided you as a baby.

Maybe you will never obtain that. Perhaps she is angry at you, mentally ill, or deceased.

But admitting that you want your mother’s love opens a doorway.

It allows you to move past your anger to the sadness that underlies it.

Most of your anger toward your mother is a smokescreen that hides an enormous reservoir of sadness beneath.

It’s a despair and pain so deep you can’t imagine surviving a plunge into that cold water.

Yet, every hurting child must go there, cry an ocean of tears, and cleanse the sadness from their heart.

There is no other way.

Tears wash the stains from your heart.

https://youtu.be/zxSTzSEiZ2c

Cultivate a mind of patience

Emotional work takes time. Even if you go deep and sob from your depths, you won’t only cry once, not with your deepest pain.

You will feel sad and cry, then you will come out of it for a time—days, weeks, or months even—and then you will feel sad again and cry more.

If you cried constantly for days or weeks, you would become depressed and endure other problems.

Mourning and recovery from trauma takes time. How much? As much as it takes.

Patience is a mind that is able to accept whatever occurs fully and happily.

Patience is not bearing the pain with a feigned smile.

Patience means welcoming wholeheartedly whatever occurs without wanting things to be any different.

Nothing your mother did is so bad that it can’t be accepted patiently, with an open, accommodating, and peaceful heart—despite the objections your mind is offering right now.

If you cultivate the mind of patience, your victim story won’t find a ready listener willing to agree with certainty that your mother is terrible, an irredeemable bitch who deserves to die.

When you think about it, you’ve already demonstrated tremendous patience—for sustaining the negative.

You’ve clung to your victim story for many years, with the clouds getting darker and darker, knowing full well you will sustain that negativity until you die.

You can cultivate a mind of patience for forgiveness as well.

It will take as long as it takes, but if you stay the course, the rewards will be a clear mind, a clean heart, and a happy life.

The wish to repay your mother’s kindness

The sign you have completely forgiven your mother is when the spontaneous desire to repay her for her kindness arises.

Impossible?

Perhaps it feels that way today, but if you are committed to forgiveness, this feeling is your signpost letting you know you’ve arrived.

Why do I believe this?

Earlier in this writing, I said that in The New Meditation Handbook from Tharpa Publications, meditation number eight is Recognizing That All Living Beings Are Our Mothers.

Well, meditation number nine is Remembering the Kindness of All Living Beings. The meditator is invited to extrapolate the love of your mother to all living beings and revel in their kindness.

The only way to get there is to have genuine feelings of kindness toward your mother.

If you recognize the many ways your mother was kind to you, the desire to reciprocate that kindness arises naturally.

I know it seems impossible today, but you can get there.

Don’t do it for your mother. That won’t motivate you to even start.

Do it for yourself. A clean heart is its own reward.

meta description "Karma

Whenever something happens I didn’t want or foresee, I still feel an initial burst of anger.

How dare Fate, Karma, God, (insert anyone other than me) make this awful thing happen?

Am I a victim?

After giggling at my foolishness momentarily, a nanosecond later, I cut that bullshit off by reminding myself that whatever occurs, it happens because of actions I took in the past, even if it was lifetimes ago.

Reincarnation is Useful Bullshit

Do I actually believe, as ontological Body reality, that I have actually existed through endless lifetimes?

No. I don’t.

But I don’t need to.

I don’t need to believe in magnetism to use a compass.

Karma still works when I act as if I’ve lived an infinite number of lifetimes, and more importantly, I have a great many more lives yet to go.

When something bad happens to me that doesn’t appear to be in any way connected to anything I’ve ever done in my life, my first reaction is, “Why me God?”

That question opens a doorway to suffering.

Enter Karma.

Instead, if I accept that whatever happened was due to something I did wrong in a previous life, it has two positive effects.

First, it cuts off the “why me” victim nonsense that makes me feel like shit.

Second, it makes me even more confident that my actions have consequences, which is what I want.

Third, and most importantly, when I consider my future lives, I know that anything I do will come back on me at some point, even if it takes thousands of lifetimes.

There is no escape from responsibility.

Moral Compass

People hurt each other for selfish reasons because they believe they can get away with it.

If my actions have no consequences, I would pretty much do what I want.

Most religions and cultures invent a Hell as a catch-all insurance policy against getting-away-with-it while you are alive, hoping perhaps this will motivate a few people to “be good” to avoid eternal damnation.

As a concept, it’s become so burdened by legalese, pointless debates on dogma, and philosophical mental masturbation that it no longer has enough emotional impact to scare people straight, assuming it ever did.

Karma is the shackle of personal responsibility every ego wants to avoid.

Yet, it must be chosen.

People have been imposing their Gods on each other since antiquity, forcing them to see the Light by using Dark, usually extinguishing the flames of heathens and heretics if they refused to accept someone else’s Salvation.

It was never about them, the people supposedly being Saved.

How fucked up is that?

Buddhism is different: It’s a path of choice.

You either choose to feel Karma’s navigating field or you don’t.

Here’s how it works.

If I truly believed my actions were absolutely going to come back to me in some form or fashion, and there was no escape, none, no dodging responsibility — when I felt that hit my heart — I didn’t want to inflict my selfish desires on anyone.

The Power of Karma is its ability to prevent me from hurting others.

I use it as a mind hack.

A useful tool to drive my motivation toward virtue.

When you learn to navigate by it Karma is an excellent moral compass, a needle aligning your heart True North, pointing you down the Proper Path.

(Taylor Swift, Your words are beautiful. Your every action proves your authenticity. You obviously “Get It.” I feel your heart!

Swifties, Disciples of Taylor Swift, you sit at the feet of a Master. You are in good hands.)

100% Responsible

Once I started navigating by Karma, I took 100% responsibility for everything that occurred to me.

Why? Because if I act unwisely, hurt people, or do bad things, it’s all going to come back to bite me in the ass.

I don’t want that.

There is no pleading for mercy. Directing consequence to another. Offering rationalizations and hoping the verdict goes my way.

Potential outcomes down the dark path are unpredictable and undesirable.

Perhaps a rival takes revenge. Perhaps a fraud perpetrated years ago is uncovered. Secrets haunt you at night, disturbing your mind.

Emotionally, you’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I don’t want that.

Regret: What Responsibility Feels Like

Live-with-no-regrets is the anthem of Desire. It’s not wise spiritual advice.

A life without regrets represents a failure to learn from mistakes.

For many years, I would seduce my wife, subtly coercing her into pleasing me when she really didn’t want to.

It isn’t a virtuous behavior. I put my selfish desire over her needs and wants.

I would not have been happy if the roles had been reversed.

For many years, I continually inflicted subtle emotional pain on my life partner.

I didn’t feel that pain because I didn’t consider her experience, and I likely would have convinced myself I wasn’t responsible for her reaction.

I felt no regret.

When I looked honestly at the behavior, an unpleasant feeling of revulsion arose.

The deeper I dug, the more intense I felt that pain.

Most people recoil when they feel the unpleasant feelings of remorse.

I use it as a warning sign.

It’s telling me that I am considering a behavior that has caused others pain in the past.

If I continue down this path, I am likely to do something that will make me feel that pain with more intensity.

Don’t do it.

Just say no.

Meta description: A minor incident in line at Costco turns into a deadly bloodbath.

Imagine you are standing in line at Costco waiting to get rotisserie chicken.

You are there with your spouse, and your special needs child, now a grown adult.

Your adult child is upset by the crying from a toddler being held by his father, and in a fit, he whacks the man in the back of the head.

You try to apologize, but the man is upset, so he pulls out a gun and shoots you and your spouse as you try to protect your son.

And when you have fallen, he unloads his weapon on your son and kills him dead right in front of you.

As you lie on the floor in agony, you watch your son take his last breath.

It could have been me and my family

My son is a young man, and at the time of this writing, he is approximately the same age as the victim, Kenneth French.

My son often goes to the local Costco with me and my wife. The only thing separating my family from the French family is luck—nothing more.

If you are the parent of a special needs child who is a grown adult living with you, this could also have happened to you.

What happened?

For reasons unknown, Kenneth French struck Salvador Sanchez while he was carrying his 18-month-old son.

Salvador Sanchez fell to the ground. He sustained a minor head injury. It’s unclear if this injury occurred as a result of his fall to the ground or Kenneth French’s blow.

When Salvador Sanchez regained his footing, he drew a weapon on the French family. The family pleaded with Mr. Sanchez, got between Mr. Sanchez and Kenneth French, and moved away from Mr. Sanchez

Salvador Sanchez, an off-duty LAPD officer, shot all three members of the retreating French family, killing their special needs son Kenneth, and shooting him in the back.

Salvador Sanchez admits he fired his gun and killed or wounded the French family. This was captured on video.

The video below details the story.

https://youtu.be/EzeHEK4usLo

The claims and motive

According to the officer's attorney, David Winslow, Sanchez briefly lost consciousness, and when he awoke, he was on the ground, and his 18-month-old son was next to him screaming. Winslow said the officer "had no choice but to use deadly force.''

Russell and Paola French said they pleaded with Sanchez not to shoot, telling the officer that their son, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was largely nonverbal, was ill.

Store security surveillance tapes showed the victims backing away from Sanchez when he fired.

Apparently, Salvador Sanchez had “no choice” but to shoot a retreating man with his back turned to him being shielded and led away by concerned parents.

Winslow said. "Sal was not acting as a police officer when he was attacked. He was off duty, acting as a father in self-defense and protecting his child.''

Again, he was protecting himself and his child from a retreating attacker who was restrained by two others.

The shooter claims he believed he was shot in the head and that he saw a weapon.

It doesn’t seem likely that a disabled man with his parents was carrying a deadly weapon, and after an exhaustive search that included drones to view the top of shelves and display cases, no weapon—or anything resembling a weapon—was ever found.

It’s unclear how someone would mistakenly believe they were shot in the head, given that there were no wounds or bleeding, which would have been profuse from a head wound.

I speculate that he felt he and his son were threatened, and the blow to his head from falling to the floor impacted his judgment. He didn’t consider his actions or his condition, and as a result, he killed a special needs man and permanently disabled both parents.

https://youtu.be/VGvWgvXibvc

Usually, the fraternal order of police will whitewash abuse by one of their own. It’s extremely rare to see any misconduct punished.

Even Derek Chauvin was protected at first. Early police reports described Floyd's death as a "medical incident" and failed to mention the officers' use of force.

While it’s possible better people oversee the LAPD, it’s more likely that former officer Sanchez’s conduct was so bad that nobody could even offer a plausible excuse.

In 2020, the Los Angeles Police Commission determined that the shooting was an unjustifiable use of force, leading to Sanchez's dismissal from the LAPD.

Mike Hestrin, Riverside County District Attorney

In the video above, the Riverside County District Attorney stands by his decision not to bring charges against the man who killed Kenneth French.

By standing by his decision, he fully accepts the consequences for his inaction. I trust the voters in Riverside County will seek a replacement.

I know I will never vote for him again.

Apparently, he presented the case to a grand jury, and they voted not to bring charges.

I can only speculate on this since I was not part of that grand jury, but it must have been the worst presentation of all time.

Did he fail to mention that Kenneth French was retreating and restrained and posed no further danger to Mr. Sanchez?

Perhaps his campaigns are funded by the police union?

Perhaps he is incompetent?

Or perhaps he doesn’t care about the lives of special needs persons?

Whatever his motivations were, his conduct was deplorable, and he demonstrated his lack of fitness for the job he was elected to.

I want to see him lose his next election. I will donate to his opponent's campaign.

Paola and Russel French

Paola and Russel French

The French family filed a lawsuit against the LAPD, the City of Los Angeles, and Sanchez, alleging negligence and civil rights violations.

In November 2021, a jury awarded the French family $17 million in damages, finding that Sanchez had used excessive and unreasonable force.

A casual reader might conclude that $17 million is a lot of money and provides a measure of justice to the family.

That’s wrong.

If the family were asked, they would undoubtedly say they would rather have their son back and their wounds healed instead of $17 million.

As the parent of a special needs adult just like Kenneth French, I can say that no amount of financial compensation would ever feel like justice.

https://youtu.be/0Gjvu7AjBkQ

California Attorney General Rob Bonta

Fortunately, justice is not denied because one man lacks the courage or ability to advocate for the French family.

In August of 2021, the State Attorney’s General Office filed charges and arrested Salvador Sanchez.

"Where there's reason to believe a crime has been committed, we will seek justice,'' Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. "That's exactly what these charges are about: pursuing justice after an independent and thorough review of the evidence and the law. Ultimately, any loss of life is a tragedy and being licensed to carry a gun doesn't mean you're not accountable for how you use it. No matter who you are, nobody is above the law.''

Justice Delayed or denied?

Salvador Sanchez is charged with voluntary manslaughter and two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm resulting in great bodily injury.

The trial began in early December 2023 at the Larson Justice Center in Indio, California, more than four years after the incident occurred.

As of the time of this writing, the trial has not concluded, no plea deal has been accepted, and no verdict has been returned.

Deputy State Attorney General Mike Murphy told a jury, "This case is about a deadly overreaction."

Murphy acknowledged that Kenneth French struck Salvador Sanchez, but he noted that Russel French immediately pushed Kenneth back—like I would have—and begged Mr. Sanchez not to hurt his special needs son.

He said he told the gunman: "He's sick, don't shoot."

"The defendant ignored their pleas, " Murphy said. "Without hesitation and without a warning, the defendant aimed his gun at the French family and pulled the trigger ten times."

Salvador Sanchez inaccurately discharged ten bullets in a busy Costco in a few seconds. Everyone is fortunate that the stray bullets that struck the food coolers didn’t injure or kill other people. Apparently, Mr. Sanchez's weapons training did not improve his aim.

"Bang, bang, bang. It was like a warzone," Russell French testified.

Out of fear of a police coverup—or a District Attorney’s inaction—Russel French stated, "I needed to survive unless this guy becomes a hero. That's what happens in countries like this."

Murphy, the prosecutor, asked Paola French if she knew she had been shot.

"I was certain," she said.

Murphy then asked her if she knew Kenneth French had been shot.

"Killed. That is the reality we live through," she said.

The courtroom fell silent as Paola French sobbed. Russell French turned to the defense table, looked Salvador Sanchez in the eyes, and exclaimed: "This guy is a cold-blooded murderer, man."

I’ll let the jury decide that.

I’ve been following this case for four years. There is no way to undo what has been done, but perhaps justice will be served, and Salvador Sanchez will never again be in a position to harm another family touched by special needs—a family like mine.

meta description "My mind is unknowable to you, despite what you might feel when reading.

Private Language is impossible, and you can’t know What it’s like to be a bat.

An Ultimate Divide exists between your subjective experience and the outside, objective world.

It’s like the information event horizon of a black hole; data only goes one way.

At the information event horizon of a black hole, whatever enters never returns.

We have no possible way of testing what happens beyond this barrier because no matter what test we run, no information to gather and analyze is ever forthcoming from the other side.

A bit like death.

Any speculation of what lies beyond is mental masturbation.

Philosophers still get off on it.

It’s funny.

Now consider this.

My body’s central nervous system sends signals to my brain where it’s brought together as a real-time simulation of conditions in the outside world.

It feels like the Inner Theater, but no Homunculus spoils the party.

That perceptual field is me.

Your perceptual field is you.

When that information goes in and generates that perceptual field, the information flow is only one way.

You and I can’t share perceptual fields. I can’t directly know your experience.

There is an Ultimate Divide between us that can’t be crossed: subjective experience.

This fact isolates us, terribly.

But humanity comes equipped with brain modules to assist with crossing this divide, including language, allowing us to communicate and making us feel less alone.

That’s why talking and listening is so soothing, at least when it’s heart-to-heart. Data exchange conversations, typical of men, fail.

I prefer not wasting wind, blowing meaningless farts of intellect at people.

However, If you want to smell one, I am a bit of a Mysterian, if you like labeling these things.

Language is cool.

That was weird, I know.

Take a break and reflect on it.

Understanding will seep in if you pause and reflect.

One more tug on that thread.

God Needs You

God is envisioned as Omniscient, meaning he knows everything.

But how can God know isolation, loneliness, separation from God?

Prior to the flowering of consciousness, God could not do this, making Him, less than all-Powerful, less than all-Knowing, less than Whole, incomplete.

God created separate conscious beings — you and me — so that He can Live though us, and incorporate those things into Himself, making Him fully Omniscient, by adding the human experience to Himself.

God Needs You to Be Whole.

Does that make you feel special and important?

Body Reality and Mind Reality

Body reality is the objective reality within which we must interact.

It’s the reality of material reductionism, the mechanics of how things work.

The Mind reality is the subjective reality imbuing us with the ability to construct reality as we wish, as long as it doesn’t contradict Body Reality.

If Mind Reality and Body Reality clash, a condition called Schizophrenia arises.

You can’t just live in your head and make it all up.

Fundamental Truth of the Mind

Every belief in your head begins as a seed planted in Body Reality.

Some information in the outside world enters your awareness.

Philosophers call these Brute Facts or, more simply, Data.

From there, you have complete control to interpret the meaning of that fact.

This is the key insight from Victor Frankl’s Man Search for Meaning.

Wedge Salads

Despite my lofty self-evaluation, my wife found a way to penetrate my delusions and get helpful information to me.

Both sides of this little interaction are aptly captured in Season 2, episode 16 of Modern Family.

This upset my wife for years.

Because I believed I was so much smarter than everyone else, no one could tell me anything. I always knew best, particularly when I didn’t.

Simply telling me things wouldn’t have penetrated my shield of arrogant superiority.

Shield of Arrogant Superiority

My pride rejected all information, not directly sustaining my lofty self-opinion.

My wife’s information came from a faulty, lowly mortal who doesn’t check her facts, so I didn’t hear her words.

But the words sunk in, subconsciously, through the back door.

Even if I had known she was the source of information originally, I most certainly would have cast a spell upon myself to forget it.

Then, later, when this new, utterly original idea emerged from my mind, it was washed clean of its association with my wife.

Then I was a genius!

When Wedge Salad incidents occurred, my wife used to go bananas.

Who could blame her?

After a while, my wife stopped becoming upset.

She used to mumble “wedge salad” under her breath and giggle — which was cool with me because I could remain prideful and enjoy the smoke.

She found the wisdom to see what was happening and use it to her advantage.

She planted Wedge Salads on purpose and waited for them to ripen.

When they did, she obtained the delightful satisfaction of outwitting the master.

meta description "What is the Self?

What do Buddhists mean when they say the self is an illusion?

The term is Anattā, my namesake.

Buddhists aren’t saying the self does not exist.

Buddhists aren’t saying you can ignore the self like it’s unreal.

Buddhists are saying that the self does not exist intrinsically, as a substantial and independent entity, independent of the mind and body that generates it.

Buddhists are saying you don’t have a soul, at least not in the way nearly everyone conceives of the idea.

There is no everlasting “you” that will carry on eternally after your body dies, certainly not one that carries your personal narrative identity from this life.

Awareness, Consciousness, and the Substantial Self.

At some point, while you were in your mother’s womb, an awareness came into existence. At first, this awareness was unfocused, but at some later point, this awareness perceived its own existence.

When raw awareness became aware of itself, consciousness came into existence. It was “Self” conscious.

In the moment consciousness perceived itself, it concluded, “I exist. I am real and substantial.

This feeling of being a substance and existing in the “real” world is intrinsic existence, and Buddhists consider this the primordial error.

The primary focus of all Buddhist practice is to correct this misperception.

This writing is intended to give you an intellectual understanding of this phenomenon.

If you can move that intellectual understanding down to your heart, or deeply into your mind, if you prefer that analogy, then you will experience enlightenment.

Bold claim?

Perhaps, but if you study and practice Buddhism, you will find that a recurring theme throughout.

Correcting the Primordial Error (Śūnyatā) is the entirety of Hinayana Buddhism.

Modern Neuroscience meets Ancient Buddhism

Prior to the late twentieth century’s advancements in Neuroscience, the concept of the self as an illusion with dependent arising was confined to Buddhist texts, generally mistranslated in the West.

Essentially, no one outside of a Buddhist monastery was even exposed to the idea and all its nuances.

Some Western Philosophers, starting with David Hume, discussed the basic concept, but it gained no credibility outside of a few academics who thought the idea was cool or figured they could make a name for themselves by popularizing it.

No Westerner actually embraced the idea or tried to live by it.

As Neuroscience progressed, particularly in the early twenty-first century, the idea became more mainstream.

In particular, the work of Anil Seth demonstrated that the self exists exactly as Buddhists posited.

Modern neuroscience confirms what the Buddha figured out 2,500 years ago.

Please watch at least the first two minutes of this video, five minutes even better.

https://youtu.be/z7_LwuuPsAE

(Anil Seth, I salute you! Everything I understand about neuroscience I owe to you. You are a Giant who’s shoulders I stand on.

So we have an ancient religion and modern neuroscience converging on an idea regarding the self.

But how can this be made more tangible?

Is this something you can experience for yourself?

Actually, yes, it is.

You can make this more than intellectual knowledge given to you by someone else.

You can know it in your own experience, and thereby really know it.

Let me show you how I learned the deepest truth of the self, firsthand.

Altered States: A Personal Exploration

Guided by my adventurous spirit, and inspired by the movie Altered States, I arranged my lifestyle so that I could spend an hour each day in a float tank, simply to experience complete sensory deprivation. 

Yes, I really did that.

I had no idea what I was getting into.

After pushing through the distractions of Monkey Mind, I found a space of quiet where I could detach from the thoughts and observe them from afar.

A higher level of consciousness

I could observe a thought, like a cloud passing across the sky. In that state of observation, I realized I did nothing to generate that thought. 

I couldn’t start it, stop it, or control it. 

It seemed to think itself. 

I wondered if this phenomenon doesn’t behave as if I am doing it, then perhaps, these thoughts are not me. 

What did that make me then? 

I didn’t know, but knew it made me something other than my thoughts.

I had found a higher level of consciousness. Not in an intellectual, conceptual way, but in my direct experience.

I found other interesting things too. 

Supported by modern neuroscience, let me take you on a brief tour of the deepest recesses of your mind. 

Parallel versus Serial processing

Your brain is a powerful parallel processor.

It processes thousands upon thousands of feelings and thoughts simultaneously, all day, and all night when you are not in Delta sleep.

Your consciousness is a serial processor working on top of the parallel one.

Consciousness presents the most important (highly emotionally charged) of these parallel ideas to the perceptual field that “You” identify with.

This presentation is sequential; thus you experience a “stream of consciousness.”

https://youtu.be/XIiq7LUX7uo

Why is this important?

Because 99% or more of your mental activity is happening behind the scenes, beneath the level of your conscious awareness.

These feelings and thoughts motivate most of your behavior and determine your moods.

It’s perilous to ignore what’s happening in your subconscious mind.

Moody Blues

Your mood is the sum total of the feelings being generated by your mind’s processing every thought, simultaneously, all the time. 

If your mind is full of negative thoughts generating disturbing feelings, it drags down your mood. 

It can make you feel terrible.

Have you ever been in a funk where you seem to emotionally vacillate between feeling a bit down and feeling really depressed?

Woody Allen said, “Most of the time I don’t have much fun. The rest of the time I don’t have any fun at all.”

That pretty much sums it up. 

That is the ordinary existence for anyone who doesn’t employ mental rituals to alter their mood.

Weeding the garden of my mind

When I first started meditating in the float tank, I had no particular agenda other than to see what would happen, similar to John C. Lilly, the inventor of the float tank.

What I discovered frightened me.

There is an unfathomable amount of garbage fermenting in the subconscious mind.

When I discovered the reality of my own mind, I suddenly became highly motivated to clean it up.

Once I realized I had thousands of poisonous thoughts taking root in my mind, I knew I had to do something.

Fortunately, I had been previously exposed to Lamrim, so I knew of a method for weeding my mental garden.

I devoted several hundred hours to practicing it.

It works.

The Voices in My Head

In the many, many hours of practice and focused awareness, I learned to parse the feelings in my subconscious mind and hear their voices. A casual reader might conclude I am psychotic, hallucinating my reality.

I am.

The consensus of modern neuroscience says I’m hallucinating Me.

This video is worth watching all the way through, many times over to absorb it’s Truth.

https://youtu.be/lyu7v7nWzfo

When you read my descriptions of voices in my mind, these aren’t the loud, insistent voices of schizophrenia.

The mind processes feelings more than thoughts.

These feelings can be associated with voice, but often, it takes concentration on aptness to match voice to feeling.

Side note: Broca’s area of the brain is your aptness processor, your brain’s thesaurus. I learned that observing my austistic son, and confirmed it in my meditations. Broca’s area allows you to match any symbolic language to the feelings in your subconscious mind.

I can give voice to feelings if I can parse their effect from the chorus of feelings and thoughts in my mind.

It takes careful, mindful observation.

But I have no special gift. Anyone can learn this with enough time and focused concentration.

Existing as a disembodied mind in a float tank free from distractions certainly helps.

Me, Myself, and I

I no longer identified with my feelings and thoughts, but this realization only took me so far.

I knew what I was not, and that’s helpful information, but it didn’t really show me who or what I feel I am.

What made me, me, and not someone else?

https://youtu.be/fajfkO_X0l0

The Act of Selfing

This is an area where the conventions of English fail us. Our minds are taught to instinctively think in terms of actors and actions, nouns and verbs. 

For every act, there is an actor; for every effect, there is a cause; so the mind conceives of the “I” as something real and substantial, a detectable nugget that might show up in a science experiment.

That isn’t how I exist. There is no substantial self.

This may come as a shock to you, but you don’t exist in a substantive, “real” way at all.

In English, when we refer to an action as an actor, we use Gerunds.

We take an action, a verb, and we press it into service as an object, a noun.

That’s what you are: an action, a process, a construct of your mind.

You’re a Gerund.

You’re Selfing.

This video is quite long, but it will explain to you exactly how you exist, grounded in modern neuroscience.

https://youtu.be/xRel1JKOEbI

You and I exist as a field of perceptual awareness created by our brains and bodies.

Our body’s central nervous system sends signals to our brains, where it’s brought together as a real-time simulation, or best guess at conditions in the outside world.

It feels like the Inner Theater, but no Homunculus spoils the party.

Binding Action in the Brain

In an evolutionary environment where split-second decisions determine life and death, the mind can’t take time to hold a committee meeting to determine a course of action all our senses can agree upon. 

If you were a mouse that needed to avoid a silent owl gliding through the sky, it would be life-ending to have the mind get a signal from the eyes that says “run” and a signal from the ears that says “no worries, keep eating” with no way to sort out what to do.

A creature without binding action would constantly respond to false signals from every sense, expending needless energy.

The calorie cost would likely result in starvation and death.

The perceptual field of awareness

The binding action in the brain creates a perceptual field of awareness that encompasses all your sense data, with the gaps filled in by your mind’s expectations.

https://youtu.be/EWEwpS8L5Cw

Most people identify with their perceptual field as the self.

My perceptual field is me.

Your perceptual field is you.

When that information goes in and generates that perceptual field, the information flow is only one way.

You and I can’t share perceptual fields. I can’t directly know your experience.

My mind is unknowable to you. An Ultimate Divide exists between your subjective experience and the outside, objective world.

Subjective experience can never be shared. You can’t know What it’s like to be a bat or another human being.

It’s like the information event horizon of a black hole; data only goes one way.

At the information event horizon of a black hole, whatever enters never returns.

We have no possible way of testing what happens beyond this barrier because no matter what test we run, no information to gather and analyze is ever forthcoming from the other side.

A bit like death.

Stop Selfing. Game Over.

You are in every way dependent upon your brain and body for your existence. Without them, no perceptual field is generated, and no selfing occurs.

Buddhists call this dependant arising.

This has a profound implication: Selfing doesn’t occur forever.

Selfing requires a brain and body in order to exist. When your body and brain fail, you cease to exist.

For an afterlife to be real, the ghost in our bio-machine must persist in some form that simulates body consciousness after death.

Which body do you get? A healthy, robust one of your youth? A decrepit and deteriorated body of old age?

Your perception of reality depends on the brain and body, and at death, you no longer have either one.

This idea frightens some people, but if you reflect on it more deeply, it shouldn’t be so troubling on a personal level.

When my brain no longer generates consciousness, I am dead — but I won’t know it.

If it’s cold in the grave, I won’t be there to feel its sting.

I will no longer exist.

Selfing stops.

There won’t be lasting weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

Some people become really distressed about this, believing it is contrary to their spiritual or religious beliefs, but I find it comforting. 

Very comforting.

There is an end to suffering—at least in this life.

I hope you find comfort in that too.

Buddhist Afterlife

Some schools of Buddhism posit an afterlife. Pure Land Buddhism imagines a place of pure mind where people are reborn without any mental impurities.

Of course, in order to get there, the practitioner must achieve a pure mind in this life, which is rewarding in itself.

Mahayana Buddhism, as practiced in Tibet posits a Very Subtle Mind as the repository of Karma, a useful convention for explaining natural differences we are born with.

The self, the narrative experience encompassing everything an individual thinks and believes, does not pass from one life to the next.

One master joked, “What continues from one life to the next is mostly our bad habits.”

https://youtu.be/peyvXUSbNVk

Realistically, any speculation of what lies beyond is mental masturbation, the favorite pastime of philosophers.

It’s both pointless and funny.

https://youtu.be/xjlBobj0iSA

Fundamental Truth of the Mind

You are free to believe whatever you want, assuming it doesn’t contradict some verifiable objective reality (and sometimes even if it does.)

Every belief in your head begins as a seed planted in objective body reality.

Sense information from the outside world enters your awareness as data.

From there, you have complete control to interpret the meaning of that fact.

There is no intrinsic meaning—no one correct interpretation that you must accept.

This is what Buddhists refer to as Emptiness of Meaning, also part of Anattā or Śūnyatā. Enlightened masters realize the empty nature of both the self and all phenomena.

For Western thinkers, this is the key insight from Victor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning.

Victor Frankl (1905–1997), You came first. Your Clear Vision Shines in Man’s Search for Meaning. Your Wisdom Guides me.

The Self Is a Narrative.

So what am I, and what are you?

A bundle of thoughts.

You are your life’s narrative, a story.

You are an evolving narrative. Each day you write a new chapter, add to yourself, and refine your beliefs.

Nothing in your mind is cast in stone. Nothing in your narrative can’t be rewritten. You can reinterpret any event at any time, change your narrative, and change who you are.

This process continues day after day until it doesn’t.

The end.

Earlier in this post, I said you were a perceptual field, but that isn’t accurate either. That is grasping at consciousness.

Anything you identify with is not you.

You are no self, Anattā. And so am I.

meta description "Overcome anger by recognizing its many faults and practicing patient acceptance.

Whenever I get angry, I recognize it immediately. Most people do. Anger leaves little doubt when it arises, and it manifests in obvious ways.

Many people become angry, but then do little or nothing to manage it, believing it’s a natural reaction that should be allowed to run its course.

Unfortunately, anger behaves like fire, and a wiser choice is to put out the flame when it’s merely a spark.

Anger grows and spreads like fire, and once it becomes a raging inferno, it’s much harder to extinguish.

Most people erroneously believe anger is caused by other people or events as if they are helpless victims of their own reactions. In truth, anger is always a reaction, and the angry person has the ability to choose not to be angry—if they learn how to control their own anger.

What is anger?

The following is adapted from How to Solve Our Human Problems by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.

Anger is a focused mind that identifies an animate or inanimate object, finds it unattractive, exaggerates its bad qualities, and wishes to harm it.

Whenever people become angry, they instinctively meditate upon it.

They think about who or what they believe makes them angry.

They find other confirming thoughts and feelings that strengthen and reinforce their anger.

They negatively characterize the (incorrectly perceived) outside source of their anger.

And they want to do something about it—usually something bad.

For example, if a driver cuts me off, I get angry.

I find that driver’s behavior unacceptable because he or she endangered me.

I imagine they are a rude, careless, and inconsiderate ass.

I want to let them know how awful they are, even at the risk of escalating the incident to violence.

Actually, I used to react that way, but I don’t behave that way anymore.

With proper mental discipline, I cut off the angry thoughts, and remind myself to feel compassion for the driver who is suffering due to their selfish behavior. That simple technique works quite well.

My anger subsides.

I’ve become so well-practiced due to my frequent commuter traffic experiences, that the entire process happens in a nanosecond. The spark of anger finds no dry tinder to ignite.

Why does anger arise?

Have you ever wanted something and not obtained it?

Anger arises.

Have you ever obtained something you did not want?

Anger arises.

Have you ever lost something you valued?

Anger arises.

As should be obvious, the above conditions happen thousands of times per day with things both large and small.

Anger has little concern for scale or magnitude.

There is always ample opportunity to become angry, and many people are angry nearly all of the time. Their only respite is in the brief moment when they obtain exactly what they want, exactly when they want it, and they don’t lose it.

Of course, that satisfaction is fleeting as their mind will naturally move on to obtaining the next object of their desire.

In addition to the major causes identified above, several additional factors contribute to the emergence of anger:

Ego-Centrism: The strong identification with one's self or ego can lead to anger when one perceives a threat or challenge to their self-importance or self-image.

Grasping at Permanence: The misconception that things should remain fixed or permanent can lead to frustration and anger when confronted with the impermanence and change inherent in life.

Judgment and Criticism: Holding harsh judgments or criticizing oneself or others can generate anger, as it creates an environment of negativity and hostility.

Impatience: Impatience and a lack of tolerance for delays or obstacles can trigger anger when one's desires are not immediately fulfilled.

Unrealistic Expectations: Unrealistic or overly high expectations of oneself or others can set the stage for anger when these expectations are not met.

Fear and Insecurity: Fear and insecurity can underlie anger, as individuals may use anger as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from perceived threats.

Anger serves a purpose—or so people think

Many people form habitual patterns of responding to challenges or frustrations with anger, often due to past conditioning or learned behaviors.

People are prone to form resentments and keep anger alive because they believe expressing their anger gets them what they want. This is the dark art of manipulation.

People sometimes express anger when their lover doesn’t please them, especially if their anger coerces their lover into doing what they want.

People sometimes turn their anger into determination to get what they want, no matter the effort or the consequences involved.

If people are continually rewarded for their anger, it becomes a hammer they use to bludgeon their way through life.

Anger is a scorched-earth approach that ruins interpersonal relationships.

Anger is often simply clueless

A lack of mindfulness or awareness can prevent individuals from recognizing the arising of anger in themselves, allowing it to escalate unchecked.

Even professional psychologists recommend techniques like distraction, humor, or exercise to manage anger rather than actually stopping it.

This merely allows anger to run unchecked in your subconscious mind. When the humor comes out, it often takes the form of biting sarcasm with the hidden intention of inflicting emotional pain.

Sometimes, individuals may find it challenging to identify and express their emotions accurately. They may use anger as a catch-all emotion to cover various underlying feelings, including sadness.

Anger masks sadness

Anger can often mask underlying feelings of sadness.

Anger can function as a defense mechanism to protect individuals from the vulnerability of experiencing sadness.

Anger can be a more immediate and outwardly directed response to a distressing situation.

Some people perceive anger as a sign of strength or control, whereas sadness may be associated with weakness or loss of control. While this may be true in military combat, it’s a poor strategy for frustrations in their interpersonal relationships.

Societal and cultural norms often encourage the expression of anger over sadness. This is the herd mentality of weakness disguised as strength. Strong men cry when they are sad.

Anger can serve as a mask or protective layer over underlying sadness, making it less apparent to others. This can be especially true in situations where individuals want to avoid appearing weak or dependent on others for support.

Why no one should become angry

Anger is a destructive emotion. Buddhist practitioners are instructed to stop anger the moment it starts. It’s wise for anyone to consider doing the same.

The primary technique Buddhists employ is to remember the many bad qualities of anger and the regrets caused by acting with an angry mind.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV2Ecd7m6Tc

The faults of anger can be broadly categorized into spiritual, psychological, and social consequences.

Relationship Consequences:

Distorted Perception: Anger clouds judgment and leads to distorted perceptions, causing individuals to see situations and people in an overly negative or hostile light. Anger narrows one's perspective and makes it difficult to empathize with others' suffering or show compassion.

Impedes Rational Thinking: Anger impairs rational thinking and problem-solving abilities, making it difficult to find constructive solutions to conflicts.

Interferes with Communication: Angry outbursts hinder effective communication, preventing individuals from understanding and resolving issues with others.

Destructive Actions: Anger often leads to impulsive and harmful actions, both in thought and behavior, which can have serious consequences for oneself and others.

Damages Relationships: Anger erodes trust and damages relationships, as it creates an environment of fear, resentment, and hostility.

Leads to Regret: After the anger subsides, individuals often regret their actions and words, causing guilt and remorse.

Cycles of Suffering: Anger perpetuates cycles of suffering by leading to more conflict and negative emotions.

Individual Consequences:

Harm to Health: Chronic anger and hostility are linked to various health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and weakened immune function. Tibetan Buddhism recognizes the interconnection of mind and body, and thus views anger as harmful to physical well-being.

Waste of Energy: Anger consumes mental and emotional energy that could be better used for positive purposes.

Reinforces Ego: It strengthens the sense of ego and self-importance, as individuals often believe their anger is justified.

Obstacle to Inner Peace: It obstructs the cultivation of inner peace, which is a central goal in Buddhism.

Obstruction to Spiritual Progress: Anger is seen as a major obstacle on the path to enlightenment. It directly opposes the cultivation of compassion and loving-kindness, which are central to Buddhist practice. Anger can destroy the merit accumulated over long periods of spiritual practice in just a moment of intense rage.

Reputational Damage: When one frequently succumbs to anger, it can harm their reputation and how others perceive them. It might lead others to see the individual as unstable, untrustworthy, or dangerous.

Creation of Negative Karma: In the Buddhist view, actions driven by anger create negative karma, leading to future suffering. This is particularly significant in the context of the belief in rebirth, where the consequences of one's actions can affect future lifetimes.

Impairment of Wisdom: Anger clouds judgment and impairs wisdom. It can lead to impulsive, irrational decisions and actions that one might later regret.

In summary, anger is a deeply harmful emotion that affects one's spiritual journey, mental and physical health, social relationships, and moral integrity.

Whenever anger arises, Buddhist practitioners remind themselves of the many problems of anger as outlined above. Usually, that is sufficient to prevent anger from growing stronger and leading to rage, spite, resentment, aggression, or harmfulness.

Practice patient acceptance

Overcoming anger fully involves the practice of patient acceptance, an attitude that allows individuals to navigate life's challenges with grace and equanimity.

Patient acceptance involves embracing reality completely and wholeheartedly, exactly as it is, and not wanting anything to be different.

Instead of resisting or rejecting anger, patient acceptance encourages individuals to face it directly. It involves not struggling against life's difficulties but learning to coexist with them.

Equanimity is a mental state of balance and calmness, regardless of external circumstances. It requires mindfulness, the practice of being fully present in the moment and observing thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without judgment.

Patient acceptance involves refraining from reacting impulsively to difficult situations. Instead, individuals are encouraged to pause, reflect, and respond with wisdom and compassion rather than reacting with anger or aggression.

Patient acceptance involves recognizing that difficult situations, like all things, are temporary and subject to change.

Patient acceptance encourages letting go of rigid attachments and allowing things to unfold naturally.

Like the Serenity Prayer, patient acceptance involves acknowledging that some things cannot be changed and learning to work with the circumstances as they are.

Ultimately, the practice of patient acceptance leads to inner transformation. It allows individuals to develop resilience, emotional stability, and a deeper understanding of themselves and the nature of existence.

With patient acceptance, even the most challenging circumstances need not lead to anger and its many harmful consequences.

Nancy and Ronald Reagan felt strongly about eliminating the scourge of drugs from our society.

They were mistaken that only the defined illegal drugs of the era were bad. Further, the policies they advocated were an abject failure that has since been abandoned.

However, their hearts were in the right place.

We need to defeat the enemy: The Pharmaceutical industry.

Cory Doctorow documented how We Paid to Develop Merck’s Covid Pill, and now they’re charging us a 4,000% markup on it.

Merck really sucks.

But they are hardly the worst.

That honor goes to Purdue Pharma.

Purdue Pharma is majority owned by the Sacklers, a multigenerational billionaire crime family of mass-murdering dope-peddlers, who basically invented modern, legal dope peddling.

Cory Doctorow documented how The Sacklers woulda gotten away with it if it wasn’t for those darned meddling feds.

Purdue Pharma really sucks.

What respectable killers look like.

Just Say No to Drugs — All of Them

I’ve never taken a prescription drug longer than a few weeks.

I’ve never taken over-the-counter drugs for more than a few months, and those were antihistamines.

I have taken illegal drugs for extended periods; at least they were illegal. Cannabis was my drug of choice.

I liked to smoke small amounts of Sativa leaf to “take the edge off.” I avoided Indicas when possible due to the mental blanking side effect.

I found that Sativa Cannabis was effective at getting me out of my head and into my heart.

I take no drugs today.

My 103-year-old grandfather

My grandfather lived to be 103 years old. The only medication he ever took was niacin for his high cholesterol.

He only took that briefly because the flushing was an unwelcome side effect.

Also, it runs in the family, and the high levels do not result in artery buildup; at least, that’s what my Cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) Scan revealed to me.

In my opinion, my grandfather lived to be 103 and sustained mental clarity for nearly all of that time because he didn’t take Pharmaceutical Drugs.

Pharmacists just say No

One of my closest friends from High School is a pharmacist. So is his wife.

They occasionally take ibuprofen, but nothing else.

I’ve known other pharmacists who have told me the same thing.

The reason they give is that these drugs are very powerful and they have many deleterious side effects.

Unless they really, really needed them, they would never consider taking them.

Senior Citizens just say Yes

I recently spoke to an 82-year old gentleman who told me that he is on about 15 different medications. He says he just does what the doctor tells him.

Apparently, that means taking a multitude of prescription drugs.

Have you ever spent time talking with retired people?

What do most of their conversations revolve around?

Seniors discuss their ailments, the meds they are on, their difficulties with insurance, and their need for these drugs for their survival. I’ve witnessed and participated in those conversations.

These talks are not uplifting.

The mindset that must die

Western culture believes that all diseases have a physical cause. It’s the nasty extension of materialism.

Physical causes must have physical remedies.

Therefore, some drug is the fix or the cure for disease.

Perhaps we haven’t discovered the magic drug yet, but we have a panoply of existing drugs to address ailments both big and small.

Apparently, we are all born with drug deficiencies.

We lack sufficient caffeine, so we must consume coffee, soda, or various powders to correct this problem.

Apparently, countless years of evolution did not provide us with a body capable of sustaining itself without infusions of exotic chemicals.

Our natural immune system requires constant infusions of drugs to sustain its operation.

It’s a miracle we made it this far.

Thank goodness for pharmaceuticals, right?

The Slippery Slope to Polypharmacy

Polypharmacy is taking many drugs at the same time.

The Pharmaceutical industry thrives on polypharmacy, so to them, it’s a necessary condition to be managed, preferably with even more drugs.

Polypharmacy happens for a simple reason.

When a single drug is prescribed, it will often have side effects.

A second drug will be prescribed to deal with the side effects.

That will induce even more prescriptions.

Eventually, the cocktail of these drugs interact and produce even more side effects, resulting in even more prescriptions.

A completely clean person like me can devolve into Polypharmacy in a matter of weeks.

Special Needs Polypharmacy

I am particularly close to the Special Needs community.

I have a 22-year-old son diagnosed with autism.

He is the only one I know who is not on a Polypharmacy regimen.

Special Needs people often don’t have the capacity to make decisions for themselves. My son doesn’t.

Thus, they are subject to the whims of their caregivers, who generally load them up with drugs.

It makes me sad to see so many drugged without their understanding or consent.

Photo by Matteo Badini on Unsplash

Drugs have their place

I am not completely against all Pharmaceutical Drugs.

As I documented in (Some) Schizophrenics are Enlightened, Minus Proper Body Anchoring, Schizophrenics often need drugs to remain safe.

But the need for drugs and the applications that drugs are applied to is a chasm so vast that a trillion-dollar industry of leaches and murders exists there.

If I were convinced a particular drug was essential to my survival — a really tough sell — I would take it.

Although, I would explore every possible natural remedy first.

Just Say No

When in doubt, just say no.

Pharmaceutical Drugs do more harm than good.

<i>[12/26/2023, 3:30:22 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The history of Christian contemplative meditation can be summarized as follows:

1. Early Christian Roots: Christian contemplative meditation has its origins in the early Christian Church, drawing from Jewish and Greco-Roman traditions of meditation and prayer. Early Christian ascetics and monastics practiced forms of contemplation and silent prayer as a means of seeking a deeper connection with God.
2. Desert Fathers and Mothers: In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Desert Fathers and Mothers, such as St. Anthony and St. Macarius, retreated to the Egyptian desert to live a life of solitude and contemplation. They developed contemplative practices, emphasizing silence, solitude, and inner prayer as ways to encounter the divine.
3. Mystical Traditions: Throughout the Middle Ages, various Christian mystics, including St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Ávila, contributed to the development of Christian contemplative practices. They wrote extensively on the mystical experiences of encountering God through prayer and contemplation.
4. The Cloud of Unknowing: Written in the 14th century, "The Cloud of Unknowing" is an anonymous Christian mystical text that introduced the concept of contemplative prayer as a way to transcend the intellect and reach a direct experience of God through love and devotion.
5. The Renaissance and Reformation: During the Renaissance and Reformation, there was a renewed interest in Christian contemplative meditation. Figures like St. Ignatius of Loyola developed structured methods of contemplative prayer, while others, like Martin Luther, emphasized the importance of personal, direct encounters with God.
6. Modern Revival: In the 20th century, there was a revival of interest in Christian contemplative meditation, often associated with figures like Thomas Merton and John Main. They adapted and popularized contemplative practices, particularly the use of a single word or phrase (mantra) for meditation, drawing from the Christian tradition's rich history.
7. Contemporary Varieties: Today, Christian contemplative meditation encompasses a variety of approaches and practices, including Centering Prayer, Lectio Divina, and Christian meditation groups. These practices aim to foster a deeper relationship with God, inner peace, and spiritual growth through silent contemplation.

In summary, Christian contemplative meditation has a long history rooted in early Christian asceticism and mysticism. It has evolved and adapted over the centuries, with various figures contributing to its development and resurgence in the modern era, making it a significant aspect of Christian spirituality today.<br>

<i>[12/26/2023, 3:31:28 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

"The Cloud of Unknowing" is a 14th-century Christian mystical text, written anonymously, that emphasizes the importance of contemplative prayer and direct experience of God. The main themes and teachings of "The Cloud of Unknowing" can be summarized as follows:

1. Contemplative Prayer: The text encourages individuals to engage in contemplative prayer as a means of deepening their connection with God. It emphasizes that this form of prayer transcends intellectual understanding and relies on love and devotion to God.
2. The Cloud of Unknowing: The title refers to the cloud of unknowing that separates human understanding from the divine. The text encourages individuals to enter this cloud of unknowing through silent contemplation, letting go of thoughts and concepts in order to encounter God beyond human comprehension.
3. Apophatic Theology: "The Cloud of Unknowing" promotes apophatic or negative theology, which involves describing God by what God is not. It suggests that God cannot be fully grasped by human intellect and is beyond all human attributes and concepts.
4. Simplicity and Humility: The text advises simplicity and humility in one's approach to contemplative prayer. It encourages individuals to set aside their intellectual pride and to approach God with a humble and pure heart.
5. Divine Love: Love is considered the primary means of connecting with God in contemplative prayer. The text emphasizes that the love of God is more important than any specific prayers or practices and that God's love is freely given to all who seek it.
6. The Role of a Spiritual Director: "The Cloud of Unknowing" suggests that individuals may benefit from the guidance of a spiritual director who can provide instruction and support in their contemplative journey.
7. Practical Instructions: The text provides practical instructions on how to engage in contemplative prayer, including the use of a "prayer word" or mantra to anchor one's focus and the practice of remaining in silence and stillness before God.
8. Spiritual Growth: The ultimate goal of contemplative prayer, as outlined in the text, is spiritual growth, union with God, and the transformation of the individual's inner being.

In summary, "The Cloud of Unknowing" is a profound Christian mystical text that encourages individuals to engage in contemplative prayer, transcending intellectual understanding to encounter God through the cloud of unknowing.

<i>[12/26/2023, 3:43:47 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

To "take something for granted" means to assume or expect that something will always be available or present without appreciating or recognizing its value, significance, or the effort that went into it. It implies not fully realizing or acknowledging the importance of something until it is no longer available or until it is threatened or lost.

For example, someone might take their good health for granted until they become ill, or they might take their loving family for granted until they experience a period of separation or difficulty. It often involves a lack of gratitude or awareness of the blessings or privileges one enjoys in life. Recognizing and appreciating what one might have taken for granted can lead to a greater sense of gratitude and a deeper appreciation for life's gifts.<br>

meta description "Tibetan Buddhist Lamrim: Your Precious Human Life
The Lamrim teachings in Tibetan Buddhism place great importance on recognizing the value of a precious human life on the spiritual path.
DEC 26, 2023
Most people take their lives for granted and fail to recognize its significance. Since none of us can stop being human, and each day we wake up, we are human, it’s understandable why few bother to appreciate it. As Popeye the Sailor Man noted, “I yam what I yam.”

Tibetan Buddhist Lamrim invites us to pause and reflect on the meaning and unique opportunities a human life begets.

There are billions of conscious life forms on planet Earth. Each one of them has a subjective experience.

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be a bat? It’s not a childish daydream; it’s a deep philosophical question.

Buddhists focus attention on the preciousness of human life because it motivates practitioners not to waste their time and effort on frivolity or worldly concerns.

A concise explanation from the Dalai Lama.
Why human life is precious
I believe life is an adventure. Not every experience is pleasant or joyful, but every moment is fresh and new, and full of possibility. Zen Buddhists call this Shoshin, a feeling of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions.

Every experience in life, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, is a wonderful gift. Perhaps from God, or Fate, or whatever belief feels right to you.

Seeing life as a gift, particularly human life, is an essential attitude for living meaningfully, mindfully, and with an open heart.

Contemplate these teachings from Lamrim:

Rare and Precious: A precious human life is regarded as exceptionally rare in the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsara).

Potential for Enlightenment: A human life offers a unique opportunity to progress on the path to enlightenment (Buddhahood). It is a platform for realizing one's spiritual potential.

Impermanence: The impermanence of life and the uncertainty of death make it essential to utilize this opportunity while it lasts.

Freedom and Opportunity: Having a human life provides the freedom and opportunity to engage in spiritual practices, and be a force for good in the world.

Helping Others: Another aspect of your precious human life is the potential to benefit others through practicing altruism and helping others on their spiritual journeys.

Purposeful Living: Only humans have the potential to lead a meaningful life by cultivating positive qualities such as compassion, loving-kindness, wisdom, and ethical conduct. This involves avoiding negative actions and negative states of mind.

Mind Training: To unlock the full potential of human life, Lamrim teaches practitioners techniques for training the mind, such as contemplation, mindfulness, and virtue meditation. Only human beings can do this.

Lamrim, the lamp on the path to enlightenment
Many people enjoy lives of opulence, fame, and hedonistic pleasure. At times, these people find life enjoyable, perhaps even special. However, worldly pursuits are fickle, and the pleasure is ephemeral.

Contemplating virtue and holding those feelings in the heart is the essence of Lamrim, the stages in the complete path to enlightenment as taught by Buddha."<br>

<i>[12/26/2023, 5:31:31 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: provide more detail on Anitya<br>
<i>[12/26/2023, 5:31:39 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Anitya, also known as "impermanence," is a fundamental concept in Buddhist philosophy and spirituality. It refers to the universal truth that all conditioned phenomena, whether material objects, feelings, thoughts, or experiences, are transient and constantly changing. Anitya is one of the Three Marks of Existence in Buddhism, along with Dukkha (suffering) and Anatta (no-self).

Key aspects of Anitya in Buddhism include:

1. Transience: Anitya teaches that nothing in the phenomenal world is permanent. Everything arises, exists for a time, and eventually passes away. This impermanence applies to both physical entities and mental states.
2. Change: Anitya emphasizes that change is an inherent quality of existence. Even the most stable-seeming entities, such as mountains or celestial bodies, undergo subtle changes over vast periods of time. Human experiences, relationships, and emotions are also in a constant state of flux.
3. Suffering (Dukkha): The impermanence of all things is closely related to the concept of suffering (Dukkha). When individuals become attached to or cling to impermanent phenomena, they experience suffering because they inevitably face separation or loss. Understanding Anitya is crucial to alleviating suffering.
4. Mindfulness: The recognition of impermanence is a central theme in Buddhist mindfulness practices. By being fully aware of the ever-changing nature of their experiences, practitioners can cultivate greater wisdom and equanimity.
5. Liberation: In Buddhism, the ultimate goal is liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara). Understanding and accepting impermanence is a crucial step toward this liberation because it leads to a detachment from worldly attachments and desires.
6. Dependent Origination: Anitya is closely linked to the concept of dependent origination (Pratityasamutpada), which explains how all things arise in dependence on causes and conditions. Impermanence is a key aspect of this interdependent nature of reality.
7. Meditation: Many Buddhist meditation practices involve contemplation of impermanence. Meditators may focus on observing the arising and passing away of thoughts, sensations, or breath to gain insight into the nature of Anitya.

Overall, Anitya is a profound teaching that encourages individuals to embrace the impermanent nature of life and to cultivate a deep understanding of reality. It serves as a foundational concept in Buddhist philosophy and practice, guiding practitioners toward wisdom, compassion, and ultimately, spiritual liberation.<br>

<i>[12/26/2023, 6:58:31 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: summarize the philosophical argument that time is merely change<br>
<i>[12/26/2023, 6:58:38 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The philosophical argument that time is merely change can be summarized as follows:

1. Time as a Concept: Philosophers argue that time is a human concept created to understand and measure the sequence of events and changes in the world. It is a mental construct that helps us make sense of our experiences.
2. Change as the Basis: According to this view, change is the fundamental reality, and time is a byproduct of change. All events, processes, and phenomena involve some form of change, whether it's the motion of objects, the aging of living beings, or the unfolding of historical events.
3. Absence of Time Without Change: Proponents of this argument contend that in the absence of any change or events, time would have no meaning or existence. Time relies on the existence of changes or events to be meaningful.
4. Time Measurement: Time is measured by comparing one change or event to another. For example, we measure time by observing the regular motion of celestial bodies (e.g., the Earth's rotation) or by tracking changes in physical systems (e.g., the swinging of a pendulum). These measurements are used to create units of time, such as seconds, minutes, and hours.
5. Subjectivity of Time: Time is subjective because it varies depending on one's perspective and experiences. The experience of time can feel different under various circumstances or states of mind. This subjectivity reinforces the idea that time is intimately linked to individual perceptions of change.
6. Relativity and Physics: Modern physics, particularly Einstein's theory of relativity, supports the idea that time is intertwined with change. In relativistic physics, time is not an absolute and uniform entity but varies relative to the motion and gravitational field of an observer.
7. Implications: The argument that time is merely change has philosophical implications for how we understand the nature of reality. It challenges the traditional view of time as a fixed, independent dimension and suggests that it is a dynamic concept rooted in the ever-changing nature of the universe.

In essence, proponents of this philosophical argument emphasize that time emerges from our need to make sense of change and that without change, time loses its significance. It invites contemplation on the deep relationship between time and the evolving nature of the cosmos.<br>

meta description "

Intellectually, we all know we are going to die. Our instinct is to survive, so the fact of certain death makes most people uncomfortable, and they push it away. Death is considered a downer.

Western culture shields us from death. We only face death when we visit a funeral home, or perhaps drive by a cemetery. Dead bodies are mostly shielded from our sight, to aid in our denial of its inevitability.

The tendency to shun death is unfortunate because meditating on death can be very motivating. When I deeply internalized the reality of death, it gave me a deeper appreciation of my precious human life, and it motivated me not to waste it.

Death

The Tibetan Buddhist Lamrim teachings on death and impermanence are fundamental aspects of the spiritual path. People who deny death and believe their wealth, status, and possessions are permanent suffer due to their attachments.

Death is something to embrace, not deny.

The summary below is based on Lamrim’s teachings with an emphasis on why these teachings are important and how we could apply them to our lives.

Impermanence (Anitya): Everything in the phenomenal world is impermanent. Nothing lasts forever, and all things, including ourselves, undergo constant change. Recognizing impermanence helps us avoid attachment to fleeting pleasures and possessions.

The Time of Death is Uncertain: Death could happen at any moment, and we have no control over it. Contemplating this uncertainty motivates us to make the most of our time and prioritize that which is most important.

Death as a Natural Process: Tibetan Buddhism views death as a natural process, not an endpoint but a transition. Christians believe the transition is from life to heaven (hopefully not hell). Understanding that the process is natural and transitions to something new can reduce the fear of death and help us face it with equanimity and peace of mind.

Life's Shortness: The teachings emphasize the brevity of life in the grand scheme of things. Our existence is like a fleeting moment in the vastness of time. This realization encourages us to use our time wisely.

Karma and Rebirth: Lamrim's teachings connect the concept of death to the law of karma (cause and effect) and the cycle of rebirth. Our actions in this life influence our future lives, motivating believers to engage in virtuous actions and purify negative karma. Christians have concepts of heaven and hell to motivate virtuous behavior in this life, too.

Spiritual Preparation: Knowing that death is inevitable, we should prepare for it spiritually. This involves cultivating positive qualities, such as compassion, wisdom, and loving-kindness, and purifying negativities through practices like meditation and confession.

Moment of Death: Contemplating the process of dying and the moment of death is a common practice in Lamrim. It encourages us to face our fears of mortality with awareness and inner peace.

Living Mindfully: Practicing mindfulness of death and impermanence in our daily lives helps us stay grounded and make conscious choices. It reminds us not to take life for granted and to cherish the present moment.

Compassion and Help for Others: Lamrim's teachings also emphasize the importance of helping others prepare for death, providing comfort and guidance to those who are dying, and practicing compassion in the face of mortality.

In summary, the Tibetan Buddhist Lamrim teachings on death and impermanence highlight the ephemeral nature of life, encouraging us to live mindfully, prepare for death, and prioritize spiritual growth. These teachings serve as a reminder to make the most of our precious human life by cultivating positive qualities and letting go of attachments to worldly concerns.

Impermanence

Anitya, also known as "impermanence," is a fundamental concept in Buddhist philosophy and spirituality. It refers to the universal truth that all things arise in dependence on causes and conditions. 

Everything arises, exists for a time, and eventually passes away. This impermanence applies to both physical entities and mental states.

Change is the fundamental reality, and time is a byproduct of change. All events, processes, and phenomena involve some form of change, whether it's the motion of objects, the aging of living beings, human relationships, or the unfolding of historical events.

When individuals become attached to or cling to impermanent phenomena, they experience suffering because they inevitably face separation or loss. 

By being fully aware of the ever-changing nature of their experiences, practitioners can cultivate greater wisdom and equanimity.

Understanding and accepting impermanence is a crucial step toward this liberation because it leads to a detachment from worldly attachments and desires.

A musical meditation on death and impermanence

I close my eyesOnly for a moment and the moment's goneAll my dreamsPass before my eyes, a curiosity[Refrain]Dust in the windAll they are is dust in the wind[Verse 2]Same old songJust a drop of water in an endless seaAll we doCrumbles to the ground though we refuse to see[Refrain]Dust in the windAll we are is dust in the wind[Verse 3]Now, don't hang onNothing lasts forever but the earth and skyIt slips awayAnd all your money won't another minute buy

meta description "Each parent has a unique experience when they realize their child is different. For most people, it isn’t a time of rejoicing.

It usually starts with suspicions because the child’s behavior isn’t typical. 

These suspicions lead to a period of consideration and denial, perhaps with doctor’s visits, or discussions with other parents. 

The emphasis is on denial because an autism diagnosis is considered the end of the world, or at least the end of parental dreams.

The Moment We Knew He Was Autistic

We had been noticing our son was unusual since he was a baby. Most notably, we were dismayed by the lack of eye contact.

He refused to look at us.

No matter what we did, he wouldn’t hold our gaze.

We were new parents, but we knew that wasn’t right. We carried on, hoping it was a phase he would grow out of.

One day, my wife came across a magazine article that listed the signs of autism. My son checked every box.

My wife immediately knew.

She showed the article to me, and I immediately knew.

We didn’t take it to be good news.

R.E.M. gets it.

My wife and I didn’t spend much time in denial about his condition, only because his condition was simply undeniable.

When didn’t get a formal diagnosis for almost a year, by which time, it was just a formality. We already knew.

Diagnosis Shopping

Many parents get second, third, or more opinions because they hold out hope some doctor will confirm their denial story.

We know of one family that received three diagnoses of autism. The fourth doctor saw the pattern and gave them a diagnosis of Ausperger’s Syndrome with Autism-like Tendencies, whatever that means. 

This placated them because, in their minds, it meant their child wasn’t autistic.

The lengths to which people go to sustain denial amazes me.

The Incipient Error

We didn’t know it at the time, but in that moment of acceptance of his condition, we made a huge mistake that took us about 15 years to correct.

We thought this was terrible news.

It was not.

It certainly wasn’t what we wanted. No parent wants to discover their child has limitations, serious limitations on his ability to contribute to the world or even care for himself.

We had no shortage of friends and family willing to confirm our worst fears that our life was over and we needed to eat a turd.

We found support groups that further reinforced that we had endured this awful tragedy, and someday if we were lucky, we would develop a taste for turds and choke them down as a badge of honor.

I couldn’t get myself to do that. I figured there must be another way.

This mistaken interpretation of our circumstances was an incipient error.

If I had known then what I know now, 15 years of heartache for my family could have been avoided entirely.

If you want to really explore the power of incipient ideas, I suggest you watch the movie Inception. It’s incredible, and it makes the point I’m pointing to here better than I ever could.

When some special needs parents read the post above, they react angrily. They protest indignantly that their experience is different, and that I don’t understand their challenges.

Of course, that is true. I don’t know their experience. I only know mine, and it wasn’t an easy journey. 

You choose how you feel about your special needs child

But I do know that they have control over the interpretation of their experience, and if they choose to apply a strongly negative interpretation, then they will endure the inevitable suffering.

It’s simply not the choice I make, and neither does my wife. And no, we are not in denial. There is no awful interpretation of reality we must embrace.

I’ve seen it argued that parents should process all of their emotions honestly as if a positive interpretation were dishonest or even harmful. Total nonsense.

Some believe it’s dangerous to minimize the grief for our lost dreams. Was there some value in the attachment to a parental fantasy? What’s the danger here?

Should we also cling to our worries about the future? Is there value in that?

A positive interpretation of your child’s condition is essential for your emotional health and for your child’s.

Grief should be minimized, as should attachments of all kinds. Denying reality serves no one.

Welcome to Holland

Like most special needs parents, I was sent the writing Welcome to Holland. It’s beautiful writing that helps put things in proper perspective.

It provides an interpretation that isn’t negative, which is a plus.

It’s been criticized: The trouble with “Welcome to Holland”

In different ways: Why I hate "Welcome to Holland"

For different reasons: What “Welcome to Holland” Gets Wrong

Many times: Autism Is Nothing Like Going to Holland

But its basic message has stood the test of time and unending criticism. Just because you didn’t get the parenting experience you dreamed of, doesn’t mean your experience can’t be beautiful in its own way.

Discover the beauty, and the problems become less challenging, joyful even.

<i>[12/27/2023, 4:02:32 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as a treatment for autism is a controversial and unproven approach that is not widely accepted by the medical community. The theoretical basis for using HBOT in autism treatment is rooted in several proposed mechanisms:

1. Inflammation Reduction: Some proponents suggest that HBOT may reduce inflammation in the brain, as autism has been associated with neuroinflammatory markers. The increased oxygen levels in the chamber are believed to have anti-inflammatory effects.
2. Improved Oxygen Delivery: HBOT involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which can potentially increase the delivery of oxygen to tissues, including the brain. Proponents argue that improved oxygen supply might enhance brain function and alleviate autism symptoms.
3. Neuroprotection: It is theorized that HBOT might offer neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress and protecting neurons from damage, which could benefit individuals with autism.
4. Enhanced Blood Flow: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is thought to improve blood flow, which could potentially enhance nutrient and oxygen delivery to brain cells, aiding in neurological function.
5. Detoxification: Some advocates suggest that HBOT may help remove toxins from the body, including heavy metals, which are believed by some to be linked to autism. They propose that the increased oxygen pressure can facilitate toxin elimination.
6. Cellular Energy: Proponents claim that HBOT can enhance cellular energy production, potentially aiding brain cells and cognitive function.

Despite these theoretical mechanisms, it's important to note that the use of HBOT for autism remains highly controversial. Most medical experts and organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, do not recommend HBOT as a standard or evidence-based treatment for autism. Research on its effectiveness and safety is limited and inconclusive. Parents considering HBOT for their child with autism should consult with qualified healthcare professionals and consider evidence-based interventions supported by scientific research.<br>

<i>[12/27/2023, 4:47:22 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The psychology behind snake oil treatments, or pseudoscientific therapies, can be understood through various psychological mechanisms:

1. Placebo Effect: Snake oil treatments often rely on the placebo effect, where individuals experience perceived improvements in their condition due to their belief in the treatment's efficacy. The mind's powerful influence over the body can lead to temporary symptom relief.
2. Confirmation Bias: People tend to seek out and remember information that confirms their preexisting beliefs. Individuals who believe in snake oil treatments may focus on anecdotes and testimonials that support their beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.
3. Desperation and Hope: People facing serious health issues or chronic conditions may feel desperate for relief and hope. Snake oil treatments often exploit this vulnerability by offering false promises of cures or relief, providing a sense of hope in challenging situations.
4. Cognitive Dissonance: When individuals invest time, money, or effort into a particular treatment, they may experience cognitive dissonance if they later question its effectiveness. To reduce this discomfort, they may convince themselves that the treatment is working or ignore evidence to the contrary.
5. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Fear of missing out on a potential miracle cure can drive individuals to try unproven treatments. They may feel that if they don't try the treatment, they might miss the one solution that could help them.
6. Authority and Trust: Some snake oil treatments use persuasive tactics, endorsements, or testimonials from seemingly credible sources to gain trust and credibility. People may be more likely to believe in the treatment if it appears to have endorsements from experts or authorities.
7. Anecdotal Evidence: Personal stories and anecdotes can be compelling, even when lacking scientific validity. Individuals may be swayed by hearing about others' positive experiences with a particular treatment, even if these anecdotes are not representative or reliable.
8. Lack of Scientific Literacy: Limited understanding of scientific principles and critical thinking can make individuals more susceptible to snake oil treatments. They may not have the tools to evaluate the scientific validity of a treatment.
9. Emotional Appeal: Snake oil treatments often employ emotional appeals, promising not only physical relief but also emotional well-being, happiness, and a sense of belonging to a supportive community.
10. Stigmatization of Conventional Medicine: Skepticism or distrust of conventional medicine and pharmaceuticals can make people more receptive to alternative or pseudoscientific treatments.

Understanding these psychological factors can help individuals critically evaluate healthcare and treatment options, making informed decisions based on scientific evidence and expert guidance rather than falling prey to snake oil treatments.<br>

<i>[12/27/2023, 5:04:06 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

The primary difference between a cure for a disease and therapy for symptoms lies in their respective objectives and outcomes:

1. Cure for a Disease:
   - Objective: The main goal of a cure is to eliminate the root cause of the disease, leading to the complete eradication of the condition from the body.
   - Outcome: When a cure is successful, the patient is typically free from the disease, and there is no longer a need for ongoing medical treatment or intervention.
   - Examples: Antibiotics for bacterial infections, antiviral medications for some viral infections, surgery to remove a tumor, and vaccination to prevent specific diseases.

2. Therapy for Symptoms:
   - Objective: The primary aim of therapy for symptoms is to alleviate or manage the signs and symptoms of a disease or medical condition, rather than curing the underlying cause.
   - Outcome: While therapy for symptoms can significantly improve a patient's quality of life and provide relief, it does not eliminate the disease itself. Patients often require ongoing treatment to manage their symptoms effectively.
   - Examples: Pain management for chronic conditions like arthritis, insulin therapy for diabetes, physical therapy for musculoskeletal issues, and medications to control symptoms in conditions like asthma or allergies.

In summary, a cure for a disease aims to eliminate the disease's root cause, resulting in the complete recovery of the patient. In contrast, therapy for symptoms focuses on managing and alleviating the signs and symptoms of a disease or condition without necessarily eliminating the underlying cause. Therapy often provides relief and improved quality of life but may require ongoing treatment.<br>
