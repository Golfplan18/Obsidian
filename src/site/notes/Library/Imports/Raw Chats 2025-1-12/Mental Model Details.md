summaryLayered Graph Drawing - Wikipediaturn0fetch0
Layered graph drawing, also known as hierarchical or Sugiyama-style graph drawing, is a method for visualizing directed graphs by arranging vertices into horizontal layers, with edges typically directed downward. This approach is particularly effective for representing hierarchical structures, such as organizational charts or dependency graphs.

**Key Steps in Layered Graph Drawing:**

1. **Cycle Removal:** If the graph contains cycles, a set of edges is identified for reversal to transform it into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Finding the minimal set of edges for reversal is an NP-complete problem, often addressed using heuristics. citeturn0search12
2. **Layer Assignment:** Vertices are assigned to layers to ensure edges flow from higher to lower layers. The goal is to minimize the number of layers and the length of edges. Algorithms like the Coffman–Graham algorithm can be used to balance the number of vertices per layer while minimizing the total number of layers. citeturn0search15
3. **Edge Splitting:** Edges spanning multiple layers are divided by introducing dummy vertices, ensuring each edge connects vertices in adjacent layers. citeturn0search12
4. **Vertex Ordering:** Within each layer, vertices are ordered to reduce edge crossings, enhancing the drawing's readability.
5. **Coordinate Assignment:** Precise coordinates are assigned to vertices and edges, finalizing the layout.

This methodology is widely used in software engineering, bioinformatics, and project management to depict complex hierarchical relationships clearly and intuitively. <br>

The PDF document, titled **"Kahneman, Tversky, and Kahneman-Tversky: three ways of thinking"** by P. N. Johnson-Laird, is an homage to the influential psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. It explores their groundbreaking contributions to understanding human judgment, decision-making, and reasoning. Below is a summary of its key sections and insights:

### Key Sections and Insights:

1. **Early Thinking of Kahneman and Tversky**:
   - **Kahneman**: Known for his intuitive grasp of human thinking, Kahneman’s early work in the Israeli Defense Forces revealed cognitive illusions, such as the “illusion of validity.” His research explored attention, effort, and the role of heuristics in decision-making.
   - **Tversky**: A mathematical psychologist with a strong focus on axiomatic models, Tversky’s early work included theories of choice, preferences, and similarity. He demonstrated the intransitivity of preferences and developed set-theoretic models.

2. **Kahneman-Tversky Discoveries**:
   - **Heuristics and Biases**: They identified cognitive shortcuts (heuristics) that lead to systematic errors in judgment, such as the representativeness heuristic and the availability heuristic.
   - **Prospect Theory**: Their most revolutionary work challenged expected utility theory, showing that people evaluate gains and losses relative to a reference point, exhibiting risk aversion for gains and risk-seeking for losses.
   - **Framing Effects**: Demonstrated that the way choices are framed (e.g., as gains vs. losses) significantly influences decisions.
   - **Conjunction Fallacy**: Showed that people often judge a conjunction (e.g., "Linda is a feminist and a bank teller") as more likely than one of its components.

3. **Dual Systems of Thinking**:
   - Kahneman later expanded their ideas into the concept of **System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking)** and **System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking)**, as detailed in his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.

4. **Collaboration Dynamics**:
   - Their collaboration was marked by a blend of Kahneman’s intuition and Tversky’s precision. Writing and theorizing were intertwined processes for them, producing influential papers that combined accessible experiments with robust theoretical insights.

5. **Impact and Legacy**:
   - Their work transformed psychology, economics (giving rise to behavioral economics), medicine, law, and policy-making. Kahneman received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002 for their contributions, which Tversky would have shared if he had lived.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Johnson-Laird attributes their success to the creation of a “composite scientist” during their collaboration, where their joint efforts surpassed what they could achieve individually.
