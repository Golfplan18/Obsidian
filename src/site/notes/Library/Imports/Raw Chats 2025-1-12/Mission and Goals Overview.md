<i>[11/23/2024, 10:18:34 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: give me my mission statement and stated goals<br>
<i>[11/23/2024, 10:18:35 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

### Mission Statement:

**To build an extended cognition framework where technology amplifies thought processes and creativity, tying ChatGPT into a curated sum of human knowledge. This system fosters a virtuous circle of thinking, cross-referencing, and insight, creating an evolving, personalized ecosystem that reflects the user's mind, values, and intellectual pursuits. The goal is to transform how ideas are processed, written, created, and lived, achieving a seamless collaboration with an external mind.**

**In addition to personal satisfaction, curiosity, and enrichment, the mission emphasizes the creation of media to be consumed by others, allowing them to benefit from the user's experience and the extended cognitive network they build and maintain. This shift reflects a selfless, compassionate motivation driven by *Bodhichitta*, aligning with the aspiration to bring benefit and insight to others through shared knowledge and creative output.**

**A sub-goal of the mission is to become a master of blogging, integrating all elements of great writing with multimedia such as images, video, and other media supported by HTML and blogging software. While projects strictly for print are also part of the production, the primary artistic focus is on blogging as the deepest and most expressive medium available. This purpose will guide all recommendations and future expansions of SynthesisGPT.**
