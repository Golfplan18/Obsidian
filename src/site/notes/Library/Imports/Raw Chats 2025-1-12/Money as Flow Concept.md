The Leading Edge

The Real Value of Money
How a viral tweet, a bonkers book and a breakthrough conversation gave me a totally new perspective on money.

Tom Morgan

[This article has a 7.5/10 woo rating]

Money is interesting. But most writing about money is boring. So I recently asked my Twitter followers: ‚Äúhave you ever read anything that changed the way you thought about money?‚Äù My question went viral and got over 3 million views.

One of the answers led to a breakthrough in the way I understand the true value of money.

A dark and terrifying depiction of a futuristic video game scene inspired by Dark Souls. The towering, humanoid end boss, constructed entirely from jagged, tarnished gold coins and shredded dollar bills, now features a bull's head with glowing red eyes and sharp, metallic horns, symbolizing power and ferocity. At the center of the boss's chest, a massive, glowing dollar sign pulses with radiant green energy, representing its greed-infused core. Glowing cracks radiate eerie light across its body, adding to its menacing presence. The boss wields a massive, corrupted weapon resembling a twisted treasure scepter. Surrounding the boss are holographic dollar signs and currency symbols, floating ominously and glowing faintly. In the foreground, a small, determined hero clad in futuristic armor wields a glowing blade, standing defiantly before the colossal creature. Hovering in the background near the boss's core, a radiant, power-up item shaped like a treasure coin promises immense power if the hero prevails. The atmosphere is tense and dramatic, with dynamic lighting highlighting the epic confrontation.
Bosses drop power-ups
By far the most popular response was from writer and technologist Siddharth Sharma:

I am yet to find anything written about money that expresses the epiphany I had some years ago. Money is electricity, not coal. Its power is in the flow. If you try and hoard it, it degrades. It has to be kept moving. And then the mindset shifts from asking how do I acquire it to asking how do I step into this flow of trillions and trillions of dollars changing hands every day? This then makes it much easier to also spend money - when you see yourself as an ephemeral steward of it as it passes through you.

There are few who feel joy when they pay others but this shift has changed everything about how I have set up my business. I want to pay people and increase the flow rather than sequester as much of it for myself and dam the flow as a result.1 Lastly, money is energy. Large quantities of it will not get you peace and relaxation any more than a hundred barrels of gasoline in your house will. This is why you don‚Äôt want to hoard it.

Somewhat coincidentally, I‚Äôve been reading the book Busting Loose From the Money Game by Robert Scheinfeld. It‚Äôs definitely the most bonkers thing I‚Äôve ever read about money.2 He makes an almost identical point that money is more of an energy flow. One of the most woo concepts is what he calls ‚ÄúCosmic Overdraft Protection.‚Äù Scheinfeld argues that once we start operating from the perspective that money is an unlimited energetic flow, a creation of consciousness itself, we effectively never run out.

Even with my new higher woo threshold, this idea triggered me. The fear of running out of money is a primary limitation on the choices I make with my life.

I soon realised the real value of money was in revealing this trigger itself.

Breaking the Spell
Nadja Taranczewski is a coach and psychologist that specialises in money. We had a short conversation specially for The Leading Edge. She led me to a personal breakthrough live on camera. And it might have a similar effect on you (Spotify/Apple podcasts links).

One of her simplest and most powerful questions is simply ask you to complete the question ‚ÄúMoney is‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Try it yourself now.

She hears three broad kinds of answers: negative, positive and mixed.3 People with negative projections would say something like ‚Äúmoney is dirty.‚Äù Somebody with positive projections would say ‚Äúmoney is freedom, self-confidence, luxury or power.‚Äù

People who hold positive projections can suffer from the illusion that they must earn money to deserve their existence, and that running out of money makes them worthless. These projections often have deeply personal causes.

The real value of money is in showing you where your shadow is. Where the parts of you that need to be integrated are.

In our conversation, Nadja tells the pretty harrowing story of a client of hers who was operated on without anaesthetic as a child (this was shockingly done until well into the 1980s4). This led her to feeling that she was ‚Äúa worthless piece of meat.‚Äù This left her reluctant to write invoices for her own business. Once she became aware of this neglected shadow, she reclaimed it by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a worthless piece of meat. And that‚Äôs O.K..‚Äù Not only did her money issues resolve, she also gained the much greater prize of a more integrated consciousness. The result of successful money work is what Nadja calls the priceless ‚Äúfeeling of being more carried by life.‚Äù

Of course, this fuzzy feeling is somewhat less valuable if you and your family then starve to death. But Nadja also believes in the possibility of what I‚Äôve called ‚Äúthe most heretical idea in Western civilization.‚Äù If we follow the right path, we will be held by life. That ‚ÄúCosmic Overdraft Protection‚Äù is in some strange way a reality. This is because there‚Äôs an energy flow that‚Äôs more powerful than money. This is the creative force of consciousness and love.5

It‚Äôs not that money isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù (whatever that means), it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs a force that‚Äôs more powerful than money that can influence the flow of everything including money.

We evolve our consciousness by walking the path, the Tao. If we do what we love in service of love, unexpected abundance will follow. The flow of love then matters more than the flow of money. But we can then only give as much as we can receive. As Rumi said ‚Äúyour task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.‚Äù This is the value of shadow work like Nadja‚Äôs; you can‚Äôt fully receive love if there‚Äôs a part you‚Äôre rejecting or blind to. Money tends to be one of the biggest barriers on our path to love, therefore money triggers are critical indicators of precisely where we need to integrate our consciousness.

In Busting Loose, Scheinfeld describes these money triggers as ‚ÄúEaster Eggs.‚Äù He suggests that every time you feel discomfort around money you allow yourself to experience the full intensity of the emotion. You then reframe that emotion as a creation of your own soul to show you where your power is hidden. You then simply say something to the effect of ‚ÄúI reclaim my power from this creation NOW!‚Äù

When you beat a boss in a video game, they drop power ups. For many people, money concerns represent the biggest bosses.

The problem is that living in money scarcity represents a more disconnected level of consciousness than living in loving, creative abundance. So it‚Äôs hard to even comprehend the possibility of a force more powerful than money. Transcending beyond this limitation is going to be a central feature of a broader societal shift.6

But we can still start by acting as if it‚Äôs true. This is faith as action not passive belief. If there‚Äôs an intelligent benign force that helps guide our evolution, it might use money triggers to help reveal where our power-ups are. Once you start deliberately noticing this, the the universe will then test your newfound awareness. I received a blatantly obvious money test within a day of my breakthrough with Nadja. How do we know how to respond to each test? At least that answer is relatively easy. As Neale Donald Walsch puts it:

What would love do now? No other question is relevant, no other question is meaningful, no other question has any importance to your soul.

This immediately made me think of Earth Elder Mindahi Bastida‚Äôs remark that, ‚Äúwater that doesn‚Äôt flow starts to stink.‚Äù

It has a few problematic aspects in my opinion. I detected a little of the "everything is just a dream and ultimately means nothing" vibe, which always strikes me as somewhat avoidant. Likewise there‚Äôs a lack of directionality to the evolution of consciousness. It seems to ignore the whole point of soul lessons and responsive reality: that the aim is in service of love or becoming more source-like, rather than simply the creation of whatever we want. This may be unfair criticism or a misreading, but reflects my gut feel.

Nadja‚Äôs two-part article on this topic is really worth reading. ‚ÄúIf money in principle has a hard time finding its way to you and you often fight for resources, you probably have unconscious negative projections (Type 1) onto money. If you have money but are often worried about losing it or concerned about how to acquire more, you probably have unconscious positive projections (Type 2) onto money. And if you earn money but somehow never have any money, if you are often plagued by feelings of guilt and then voluntarily and involuntarily find ways to get rid of money as quickly as possible, then it is likely that you are wavering between the projections of both types, between disgust and greed (Type 3).‚Äù

Source: Newsweek: ‚ÄúThe belief that babies' nervous systems were undeveloped and they therefore could not feel pain meant they were not provided with anesthesia as standard practice. Instead, babies were administered muscle relaxants to stop them from moving during invasive procedures‚Ä¶. surveys of medical professionals conducted as recently as 1986 indicated that infants younger than 15 months were still receiving no pain relief during surgery in many hospitals across the U.S.‚Äù Sometimes the prevailing materialist scientific paradigm is wrong guys.

5
Shadow work also prevents us from wanting the wrong things. If consciousness is in fact more creative and impactful than materialist science currently accepts, that‚Äôs a lot of responsibility. Essentially: we can ‚Äúmanifest‚Äù our desires in reality to a greater degree than scientific materialism currently accepts. New Age manifestation doctrines like The Secret give me the heebie jeebies not because they are false, but because they might be right. Since humans could talk we‚Äôve been telling a variant of the ‚Äúbe careful what you wish for myth.‚Äù We ask the witch for a spell or the genie for a wish unaware of unintended consequences. This is how our blinkered, egoic intellect messes with complex adaptive systems.

My friend Steve Sanduski recommended one of his favourite Barron‚Äôs interviews with Lynne Twist. She tells the story of meeting the prophetic genius Buckminster Fuller in 1976. He said that the world was moving from a zero-sum structure to positive sum. ‚ÄúIt would take 50 years because humanity‚Äôs institutions were rooted in a you OR me scarcity paradigm and we‚Äôd need 50 years for them to become so dysfunctional that they will no longer be repairable. And from the demise of this old paradigm would spring a new paradigm, a you AND me paradigm where there is enough for everyone everywhere to have a healthy and productive life.‚Äù 50 years from 1976 is 2026; the same timeframe I‚Äôm hearing in an increasingly bizarre number of places currently.

So, what keeps us stuck in the money bubble, rather than the greater consciousness, the tao? Or in other words - what lies beyond money? Or: how do we burst the bubble/pierce the veil?

I have found burning money to be a particularly effective form of Psychomagic to answer the question, what happens when we get rid of money. As recommended by Jon Harris and his Church of Burn, it's important to not expect or ask for anything back with the act - to not be intending to 'buy' anything, but purely giving it back to spirit (or tao...).

He has a lot of very interesting thoughts on money.

<i>[11/25/2024, 10:47:22 PM]</i> üëâ <b>ü§ñ Assistant</b>: 

Tom Morgan's article, "The Leading Edge," explores a paradigm-shifting perspective on the nature and value of money, weaving together insights from a viral tweet, philosophical ideas, and personal breakthroughs. Here's a summary and analysis of his key points:

### **Summary**

1. **Money as Flowing Energy**:
   - Siddharth Sharma likens money to electricity, emphasizing its value in circulation rather than hoarding. This mindset transforms the focus from acquisition to engaging in the flow of economic activity. 
   - Sharma asserts that joy in spending, as a steward of money, fosters its movement and keeps the "energy" alive.

2. **Philosophical and Psychological Insights**:
   - **Robert Scheinfeld's "Cosmic Overdraft Protection"**: Scheinfeld proposes that money operates as an unlimited energetic flow rooted in consciousness, suggesting that scarcity is an illusion. While intriguing, this notion challenges materialist fears, such as running out of money.
   - **Nadja Taranczewski's Shadow Work**: Through personal coaching examples, Taranczewski argues that money reveals psychological "shadows" (unresolved traumas or fears). By addressing these, individuals not only resolve money-related issues but achieve greater self-integration.

3. **Money as a Spiritual and Evolutionary Tool**:
   - Money triggers emotional responses that indicate where personal growth is needed, which Scheinfeld compares to "boss battles" in video games that yield "power-ups" upon success.
   - The author links these concepts to larger spiritual principles, including the idea that transcending monetary limitations requires faith in love and creativity as ultimate drivers of abundance.

4. **Cultural and Systemic Transformation**:
   - Referring to insights by Lynne Twist and Buckminster Fuller, Morgan suggests humanity is transitioning from a scarcity mindset ("you OR me") to an abundance paradigm ("you AND me"). This shift is seen as essential for collective progress and is expected to culminate around 2026.

### **Analysis**

1. **Strengths of the Argument**:
   - **Innovative Perspectives**: The article effectively challenges conventional views of money by integrating philosophical, psychological, and spiritual lenses.
   - **Practical Applications**: The concept of reframing money triggers as opportunities for growth offers readers actionable insights, such as completing the prompt ‚ÄúMoney is...‚Äù to uncover subconscious beliefs.
   - **Cultural Relevance**: By contextualizing personal insights within broader societal shifts, Morgan connects individual transformation to collective evolution.

2. **Challenges and Critiques**:
   - **Abstract Concepts**: Ideas like "Cosmic Overdraft Protection" and the energetic flow of money might alienate readers seeking practical, material solutions to financial problems.
   - **Overgeneralization**: The suggestion that resolving shadow work will naturally lead to financial abundance risks oversimplifying complex socio-economic realities.
   - **Woo Factor**: Morgan acknowledges the "woo" threshold, signaling that some ideas (e.g., manifestation doctrines) may feel speculative or lack empirical grounding.

3. **Broader Implications**:
   - The article invites readers to reconsider not just their relationship with money but their entire worldview. It promotes a shift from scarcity-driven anxiety to abundance-driven creativity, aligning personal growth with spiritual principles.
   - Morgan‚Äôs narrative aligns with emerging cultural movements questioning materialist paradigms and exploring consciousness as a foundational force in human experience.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
- **Redefine Money**: Viewing money as a flow rather than a static resource transforms its role from a source of stress to a tool for connection and growth.
- **Embrace Triggers**: Money-related discomforts can serve as indicators of deeper psychological or spiritual work needed for self-integration.
- **Faith in Abundance**: Aligning actions with love and creativity rather than fear and scarcity paves the way for unexpected opportunities and fulfillment.

Morgan‚Äôs article is both a thought-provoking exploration of money's value and a call to action for integrating consciousness, love, and creativity into our financial lives and beyond.<br>
