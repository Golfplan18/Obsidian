<i>[1/9/2025, 9:04:27 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: Flow charts in obsidian <br>
<i>[1/9/2025, 9:04:36 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

Creating flowcharts in Obsidian can be done effectively using plugins or built-in markdown syntax. Here are a few methods and tools for creating flowcharts in Obsidian:

---

### 1. **Mermaid Diagrams (Built-In Support)**
Obsidian natively supports [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) for creating flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more. Here's how to create a flowchart using Mermaid:

- **Syntax Example:**
  ```markdown
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Start] --> B{Decision}
      B -->|Yes| C[Option 1]
      B -->|No| D[Option 2]
      C --> E[End]
      D --> E[End]
  ```
  ```

- **Steps to Use:**
  1. Open a note in Obsidian.
  2. Add the code block above.
  3. Switch to Preview mode to see the rendered flowchart.

---

### 2. **Obsidian Plugins for Flowcharts**
Several plugins can enhance flowchart creation and integration:

#### **Excalidraw**
- A versatile drawing plugin for sketching flowcharts.
- Allows freehand and structured diagram creation directly within Obsidian.

#### **Obsidian Mind Map Plugin**
- Useful for visualizing hierarchical relationships.
- Converts text into mind maps, which can also resemble flowcharts depending on the structure.

#### **TiddyMaps**
- A plugin for creating and managing network-style diagrams.
- Offers flexibility for flowchart-like structures.

---

### 3. **Third-Party Tools with Embeds**
If you prefer external tools for more advanced flowcharts, you can embed the diagrams in Obsidian.

- **Draw.io (diagrams.net):**
  1. Create a flowchart in [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).
  2. Save the file as an image or SVG.
  3. Embed it in Obsidian using markdown:
     ```markdown
     ![Flowchart](path/to/flowchart.png)
     ```

- **Lucidchart / Miro Integration:**
  Use links or exports from these tools to integrate detailed diagrams.

---

### 4. **Canvas (Native Feature)**
- Obsidian's **Canvas** is a built-in feature (introduced in version 1.1+) that allows you to create freeform diagrams.
- Add cards and connect them with arrows to simulate flowcharts.
- It's ideal for brainstorming or building interconnected visual layouts.

---

These methods provide a range of options depending on your needs—from simple, text-based flowcharts with Mermaid to advanced visuals with external tools. Would you like detailed guidance on any specific method?<br>

  - Links to notes or files within your vault.
  - Media (images, videos, etc.).
- **Customization:** Resize, color-code, and align cards for better organization.

#### 3. **Connections**
- **Links:** Create arrows and lines to show relationships between cards.
- **Annotations:** Add text to arrows or connections for clarity.
- **Clickable Links:** Nodes can link directly to other notes or documents.

<i>[1/9/2025, 9:37:11 PM]</i> 👉 <b>👤 User</b>: Is canvas linked by an entry? Is it related to an entry is every entry actually put on a canvas is it different than the text editor?<br>
<i>[1/9/2025, 9:37:24 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

### **Understanding Obsidian Canvas and Its Relationship to Entries**

Obsidian Canvas is a **separate tool** from the standard text editor in Obsidian. Here’s how it relates to entries and differs from the traditional text editor:

---

### **1. Canvas Is Not Automatically Linked to Notes**
- **Independent Files:** Each canvas is stored as a `.canvas` file within your Obsidian vault, separate from regular markdown notes.
- **Manual Linking:** You can manually embed notes, media, or other content into a canvas, but this does not happen automatically.
- **Relationship Mapping:** Canvas allows you to visually organize notes and files by manually linking them with arrows or connections.

---

### **2. Relationship to Notes/Entries**
- **Embed Notes:** You can drag and drop existing markdown files from your vault into a canvas. The embedded notes can be updated dynamically—if you edit the original note, the changes reflect in the canvas.
- **New Notes from Canvas:** Create new notes directly from a canvas. For instance:
  - Add a card on the canvas and link it to a new note.
  - Right-click and select "Convert to note" to turn a text card into a standalone markdown file.

---

### **3. How Canvas Differs from the Text Editor**
#### **Canvas:**
- **Visual and Spatial Organization:** Think of it as a "whiteboard" for arranging cards, notes, and media in a freeform space.
- **Connections:** Use arrows and lines to show relationships or hierarchies between items.
- **Media Embedding:** Directly embed images, videos, or other files alongside text.
- **Layers:** Organize complex projects by separating items into layers for better focus.
- **Non-linear Workflow:** You aren’t constrained by a vertical, linear flow of text.

#### **Text Editor:**
- **Markdown-Based:** Standard text editor for writing and managing notes using markdown.
- **Linear Structure:** Organized as plain text with optional headings, lists, and formatting.
- **Links and Backlinks:** Create connections between notes using Obsidian’s linking system (e.g., `[[Note Title]]`).
- **Dataview/Plugins:** Use Obsidian's plugins to analyze or format data within the text.

---

### **4. Typical Use Cases for Canvas**
- **Mind Mapping:** Organize and visualize ideas in a brainstorming session.
- **Project Planning:** Map out tasks and relationships between them.
- **Storyboarding:** Plan plotlines or visualize the structure of a story.
- **Knowledge Mapping:** Create visual overviews of linked ideas and concepts in your vault.

---

### **5. Linking Canvas with Notes**
- **Bidirectional Linking:** Notes can be linked to a canvas, and canvases can reference notes. For example:
  - In a markdown file, link to a canvas using `[[Canvas Name.canvas]]`.
  - In a canvas, embed a note or link to it with clickable connections.

---

Canvas and the text editor complement each other by offering different approaches to organizing and interacting with your information. Would you like guidance on linking notes or workflows with Canvas?<br>
