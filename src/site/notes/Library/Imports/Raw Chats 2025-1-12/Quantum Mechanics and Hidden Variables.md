Hello. Hello. In quantum physics, we have what they conventionally call the collapse of the wave function. And in my opinion there's always a particle in there. We're just ignorant. to its path and the only way you can describe it's journey to where it started to where it ends at the quantum level is through probabilities and equations. But there is actually a particle in there that is taking a specific path. It is not existing as this ghost like probability until it's measured. I got a little piece of writing that I want to paste that I think gets to this point. Please take a look at it and see if you can draw a comparison.

"What’s more, as emphasized by the philosopher Ian Hacking2,
 probability is “Janus-faced”: it handles both chance and ignorance. 
Imagine I flip a coin, and ask you the probability that it will come up 
heads. You happily say “50–50”, or “half”, or some other variant. I then
 flip the coin, take a quick peek, but cover it up, and ask: what’s your
 probability it’s heads now?
Note that I say “your” probability, 
not “the” probability. Most people are now hesitant to give an answer, 
before grudgingly repeating “50–50”. But the event has now happened, and
 there is no randomness left — just your ignorance. The situation has 
flipped from ‘aleatory’ uncertainty, about the future we cannot know, to
 ‘epistemic’ uncertainty, about what we currently do not know. Numerical
 probability is used for both these situations."<br>

You've touched upon a fascinating and deeply debated topic in quantum mechanics: the collapse of the wave function and the nature of reality at the quantum level. Your intuition that there's always a particle "in there" and that we're simply ignorant of its path aligns with what's often called the "hidden variable" interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Let's break down your main points and connect them to the provided excerpt:

**1. The "Always a Particle" View:** You believe a particle follows a definite path, even though we can only describe it probabilistically. This resonates with the excerpt's discussion of epistemic uncertainty – the uncertainty stemming from our lack of knowledge. In this case, the "hidden variable" would be the particle's actual path, which is hidden from our observation.

**2. The Collapse as a Shift in Knowledge:** The act of measurement, in your view, doesn't change the reality of the particle's path but rather reveals something that was already true. This connects to the coin flip analogy. Before looking at the coin, your uncertainty is about the future outcome (aleatory). After the flip, the outcome is fixed, and your uncertainty becomes epistemic—you don't know the result, but it definitively exists. Similarly, you suggest that the particle always has a definite position and momentum, and measurement merely reveals this pre-existing state.

**3. Challenging the "Ghostly" Probability:** You object to the idea of the particle existing as a "ghostly" probability distribution before measurement. This challenges the traditional Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which suggests that the act of measurement forces the wave function to collapse into a definite state.

**Connecting to the Excerpt:**

The excerpt highlights the dual nature of probability, encompassing both genuine randomness (aleatory) and lack of knowledge (epistemic). Your perspective leans heavily towards the epistemic side when it comes to quantum mechanics. You see the probabilities in quantum mechanics as reflecting our ignorance of the particle's true path, rather than representing an inherent indeterminacy in the universe.

**Important Considerations:**

While your view is intuitively appealing, it's important to acknowledge that the hidden variable interpretations of quantum mechanics face significant challenges. Experiments, particularly those related to Bell's inequalities, have provided strong evidence against certain types of hidden variable theories.

**In Conclusion:**

Your perspective raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of reality and the role of observation in quantum mechanics. The analogy with the coin flip effectively illustrates the distinction between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, and how this distinction might apply to our understanding of quantum phenomena. Whether or not hidden variables ultimately play a role in quantum mechanics remains an open question, but your intuition provides a valuable lens for exploring these foundational issues.
