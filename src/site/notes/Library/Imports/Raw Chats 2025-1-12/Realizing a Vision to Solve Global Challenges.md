## Conversation
ðŸ‘‰ - Indicates the current conversation path

<i>[12/6/2024, 6:13:10 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: 

"B. Call to Action: Empowering a Global Movement
A. Why Immediate Action is Crucial
The technology to realize this vision exists today. Every moment of delay limits the worldâ€™s potential to solve critical problems, from climate change to educational inequities. With an open-source approach, this system can empower billionsâ€”quickly and equitably.
B. What You Can Do
Developers and Technologists:
Contribute to open-source repositories.
Innovate modular tools for AI agent collaboration.
Educators and Researchers:
Share knowledge and resources to enrich the Knower.
Use the system to accelerate breakthroughs in your field.
Governments and Institutions:
Fund initiatives that promote equitable access to AI systems.
Adopt transparent governance frameworks to ensure ethical use.
Everyone:
Advocate for open knowledge and ethical AI development.
Experiment with existing tools and share insights with the community.
C. How to Start
Visit our project hub (link here).
Join the conversation on forums and collaborative platforms.
Share this white paper freely to inspire participation."

I want to expand this section. The final product I will want at the end of our brainstorm is an update to this outline.

Ideas of specific things I want to see happen to add to the call to action:

I want to establish a foundation to create and maintain this idea, and I want to oversee the project. I want to see this generously funded by various charities and government sources. I want to see this outside of any governmental control.

I want to see developers who are working on AI, particularly the AI Agent space to embrace this idea and come together in a way that makes it happen. These are the people that will be at the forefront of the coming transformation. Specifically, I want to see a library of Agents, freely available to everyone. These agents are the first viable product of the initiative. At first they will be specialists doing ordinary tasks, but as they come together in creative ways, amazing Agents will be created.

I want to see influences, celebrities, experts in this and related fields, everyone with an excitement for the idea to do two things: 1. publicly endorse the idea, perhaps signing on to an endorsement seeking billions of signatures. 2. spread the idea and get others to sign on to the endorsement petition.
This endorsement movement is like collecting signatures for a petition for a ballot initiative. It's a sign of the political strength, the public desire to see this come to pass. This will embolden private support and eventually compel government support.

I need to create a public statement for people to sign onto. It will explain the key principles, the product, and it's uses. It will also have sub-initiatives like the Prior Art initiative, the Big Challenge initiative (the curated list of the most difficult problems likely to yield to this technique), The Eradication of Poverty initiative, World Peace Initiative, [give me some ideas]

Give me other ideas for things to add to the call to action.<br>

<i>[12/6/2024, 6:13:10 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

 Let me help expand the call to action with additional structured initiatives and organizational elements. Here are some key additions to consider:

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these elements or explore additional ideas for the call to action.<br>

<i>[12/6/2024, 6:14:28 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: how would this work? Who would get to vote? How are the votes weighted?<br>
<i>[12/6/2024, 6:14:28 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

 Let me outline a potential governance structure for the Open Mind Foundation, balancing democratic participation with expertise and stake:

Voting Structure:

1. Multi-Stakeholder Voting System
- Core Contributors: Developers, researchers actively contributing code/research (3x vote weight)
- Domain Experts: Verified experts in relevant fields (2x vote weight) 
- General Community: Registered participants who meet minimum participation criteria (1x vote weight)

2. Qualification Requirements
Core Contributors:
- Must have made significant verifiable contributions in last 6 months
- Contributions evaluated by peer review
- Can include code, research, documentation, or other substantive work

Domain Experts:
- Verified credentials in relevant fields
- Active engagement with foundation projects
- Regular contributions to discussions/direction

General Community:
- Must complete basic AI ethics training
- Minimum participation period (e.g., 3 months)
- Regular engagement with community

3. Voting Categories

Strategic Decisions:
- Major directional changes
- Significant resource allocation
- Key appointments
-> Requires 66% majority across all categories

Technical Decisions:
- Protocol standards
- Agent specifications
- Security requirements  
-> Weighted toward Core Contributors

Administrative Decisions:
- Day-to-day operations
- Minor resource allocation
- Community management
-> Simple majority of engaged participants

4. Implementation

Technical Platform:
- Blockchain-based voting system for transparency
- Smart contracts to enforce voting rules
- Public verification of votes and results
- Immutable record of decisions

Checks and Balances:
- Ethics board veto power on safety issues
- Regular review of voting weights and categories
- Appeals process for disputed decisions
- Term limits for key positions

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or explore additional governance mechanisms?<br>

<i>[12/6/2024, 6:16:18 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: 

Add environmental cleanup initiative to remove plastics and pollutants from our lives.
