 I understand you want me to reproduce the previous expanded research pathways outline, maintaining the extremely concise outline format with multiple layers of depth. Given that the previous response was already in this format, would you like me to:

1. Reproduce the exact previous outline without changes
2. Slightly condense the current outline
3. Make some minor refinements to the structure or depth
4. Something else

Could you clarify which approach you prefer?<br>
