paraphrase the following "Self Cherishing
Self-cherishing refers to the self-centered attitude that prioritizes one's own well-being and desires over the welfare of others.

Most people spend their lives doing whatever they can to make themselves happy. Perhaps others are invited to enjoy the ride, but often their desire for happiness is exclusive to themselves.

Every thought they have is self-centered and focused single-mindedly on what they want and how they plan to obtain whatever they desire.

Our entire economic system is predicated on the idea that individuals ruthlessly purse their selfish ends. In short, self-cherishing, the act of valuing oneâ€™s own needs above all others, is deeply embedded into each person and our collective consciousness.

Yet, it doesnâ€™t work.

People have been pursuing their own ends since the beginning of time, yet no one succeeds.

Sure, some people present an outward facade of emotional success, flaunting their income with conspicuous consumption, bragging about their accomplishments, and generally hoping to get others to believe they have it all together.

Itâ€™s a fraud.

The Buddha was born a prince, and he had every advantage in life, yet he was not happy. He came to believe innate unhappiness was the nature of the mind itself."<br>

Self-centeredness and Prioritizing Personal Desires

The concept of self-centeredness revolves around an individualistic perspective that places personal welfare and desires ahead of the well-being of others. This mindset is characterized by a relentless pursuit of personal satisfaction, often at the expense of communal welfare.

Individuals typically dedicate their existence to seeking personal joy, occasionally allowing others to partake in their journey, yet predominantly with a focus on their own happiness. Their every thought and action is driven by personal desires and the strategies to achieve these aspirations.

The foundation of our economic structure is built on the notion that individuals aggressively chase their selfish goals. In essence, the practice of prioritizing one's own needs over others', known as self-centeredness, is deeply ingrained in both individual and collective mindsets.

However, this approach proves ineffective.

Despite centuries of individuals chasing their personal goals, true success remains elusive. Some may display an illusion of emotional and financial triumph, showcasing their wealth and achievements in an attempt to appear fulfilled.

But this is merely a deception.

Even the Buddha, who lived a life of luxury as a prince, found himself discontented. He concluded that inherent dissatisfaction was a fundamental characteristic of the human psyche.<br>
