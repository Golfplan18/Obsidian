The demon paused, and looked at me, and asked, “How do you feel?”

I checked my feelings and noted, “Good. Relieved, my burden is gone. Thank you.”

He said,

Congratulations! You just committed cold-blooded murder!

And you chose it!

You wanted him to die — and you got your wish.

Your heart is twisted with Selfish Desire, and you harnessed it to commit an egregious, unforgivable act.

You‘ve proven you’re an able apprentice.

I said, “Why can I still remember? You said you would erase the memories.”

He replied, “I erased everyone else’s memory of him, so he has no existence outside of your mind.

But I can’t remove the heart stain of Your Choices entirely, so you must live with it.”

I said, “If I’d known that was the deal, I wouldn’t have made that choice.””<br>

### Paraphrased Narrative

The demon stood before me, silent but attentive, its eyes gleaming with something far too human. My son, everything he embodied, vanished in an instant. I felt the air hollow out where he once was, and though my hands trembled, I straightened my spine. The weight I carried for so long lifted, and for a fleeting moment, I welcomed the release.

“How do you feel?” the demon asked, its voice smooth, disarming.

I searched myself. “Good,” I admitted. “Relieved. The burden’s gone. Thank you.”

The demon’s laughter stabbed through the silence, sharp and merciless. “Congratulations,” it said, voice curling like smoke. “You’ve committed murder. Cold-blooded. Calculated. And you *chose* it.”

I flinched. My stomach churned. “You wanted him dead,” the demon pressed, stepping closer. “And you got what you craved. That sick, twisted knot in your heart—that selfish desire—you used it. You wielded it like a blade to cut him away. You’ve proven yourself well. You’ll make an excellent apprentice.”

The words slashed me, but I bit back the bile rising in my throat. “Why can I still remember him?” I asked, voice cracked, raw. “You said you’d erase the memories.”

The demon’s grin widened, exposing teeth too sharp for comfort. “Oh, I erased him from *everyone else’s* mind,” it replied, its tone almost casual. “He no longer exists to them. No trace. No whispers. No dreams. But you?” It leaned closer, a shadow looming over my thoughts. “I can’t scrub the stain of *your choice* from your soul. That mark? It’s yours to carry.”

My pulse thundered in my ears. “If I’d known,” I said, breath catching, “I wouldn’t have agreed.”

The demon chuckled, turning away, the finality of its silence heavier than words.<br>

The demon chuckled, turning away, the finality of its silence heavier than words.

He laughed,

You can’t lie to me. You would have made the same choice either way.

You’re just upset that your desires weren’t satiated.

And why would you trust a demon anyway?

Pray I don’t alter the deal further.

Feeling the betrayal, I exploded again.

This time, he was going down!

My adrenals opened, and every fiber of my being rose up for one final assault.

One decisive battle.

I sustained this hatred, beaming it intensely at him, channeling all my frustration and anger until it reached a fever pitch, and I could no longer do battle.

My Qi ran out.

He won.

He glowed with a red aura while he absorbed my Qi, bathing in it, reveling in the power I surrendered to him.

As I lay there spent, in crushed defeat, I thought, perhaps, it was over.

And end to suffering.

But no.

Then he gives me one more fact to chew on:

I’m trapped in Saṃsāra.

I need to go back and do it all over again in my next life.

And the next one, and the next one.

Endlessly.

Now, my failure was complete.”<br>

### Paraphrased Narrative

My pulse hammered in my ears, each beat a drum of regret. “If I’d known,” I gasped, voice cracking under the weight, “I wouldn’t have agreed.”

The demon chuckled, its laughter curling like smoke, heavy and mocking. It didn’t turn back, didn’t need to. Its words flayed me where I stood. “You can’t lie to me,” it said, the voice a scalpel cutting deep. “You’d have chosen the same path no matter what. Your anger now? It’s not regret—it’s frustration. Your hunger wasn’t satisfied. And tell me—why did you trust a demon to begin with? Foolish.”

It paused, savoring the silence before the final twist. “Pray I don’t alter the deal further.”

The betrayal snapped something inside me. Fury boiled over. I screamed, raw and unrelenting, and surged forward. My body burned with a desperate energy, every fiber ignited for one final assault. I poured everything I had into this one moment—every drop of anger, every fragment of frustration, every shred of defiance.

My Qi blazed as I focused it, channeling it with reckless intensity, hatred arcing through me like a wildfire. I hurled myself at him, my entire being a weapon. For a heartbeat, I believed I could win. Then my strength faltered, wavered, drained.

The demon glowed red, his aura expanding as he absorbed my Qi, drinking it in, savoring it. He bathed in the power I had spent, feeding on my failure like a banquet. His laughter echoed, rich with triumph, as I collapsed, my body hollowed out, my spirit gutted.

I lay there, broken, my breath shallow and my will extinguished. I thought maybe this was it—an end to the suffering, to the cycle. Perhaps, I dared hope, it was over.

But he crouched beside me, his voice soft yet sharper than any blade. “No,” he said, the word heavy with finality. “You’re trapped in Saṃsāra. You’ll go back and live it all over again. The pain. The choices. The failures. And again, and again, endlessly.”

I closed my eyes, the weight of those words crushing me. My defeat was no longer just a moment—it was eternal.<br>

When my heart felt the Evil Demon, I sensed his hotline to Hell.

In that moment, I realized Hell need not be a physical location.

True Hell — the worst place to exist — lies buried in the deepest region of the human heart, and you need not wait for death to experience it.

”<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 8:05:17 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

### Paraphrased Narrative

Hell isn’t a place beyond. It isn’t fire or brimstone, nor the screams of the damned. Hell lives closer than that, nearer than any of us dare to imagine.

When I faced the demon, his presence coursed through me, jagged and dark, like shards piercing my chest. His eyes gleamed with malice, a portal to something far worse than death. I felt it then, deep in my core, an undeniable truth I couldn’t escape.

Hell doesn’t wait beyond this life. It roots itself here, inside us, a seed nestled in the darkest corners of the heart. It grows, fed by despair, watered by guilt. Hell thrives where shame festers, where love twists into something grotesque and bitter.

As I stood there, caught in the demon’s gaze, I understood. This was Hell—not a place to fear after the grave but a prison we build within ourselves, stone by stone. The deepest pit of torment doesn’t lie beneath us. It carves itself into the human soul, dragging us into its abyss long before death claims us.

Hell doesn’t require gates or flames. It feeds on regret, on the things we can’t undo, on choices that stain us forever. And worst of all, you never leave it. You carry it with you. Wherever you go, it waits. Inside.<br>

provide 10 emotionally evocative, emotional hooks for brief headings of this section  “Cruelty is an advanced achievement on the Dark path, synthesizing indifference (absence of love) and malice (evil intention).

I find the feeling so painful, so toxic; I know it only to know it; I never linger there.

I hope you don’t see it in your heart.

Evil lurks in the shadows.”<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 8:07:04 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

### Paraphrased Narrative

Cruelty stands as the pinnacle of the dark path, forged from two elements: indifference—the hollow absence of love—and malice, the sharp edge of intentional harm. Together, they create something far more toxic, a venom that eats away at the soul.

I’ve felt it before, that searing ache. It burns, heavy and bitter, a poison I refuse to carry for long. I’ve learned to recognize it, to acknowledge its existence without letting it linger. To hold onto cruelty is to invite ruin, to let your humanity rot from within.

I hope you never find it lurking in your heart. I hope it doesn’t coil itself in the shadows of your thoughts, waiting for a moment of weakness. Because once it grips you, it’s hard to let go.  

Evil thrives where light dims. It waits, patient and cunning, in the darkest corners of the mind. You must remain vigilant, or it will consume you.

Note to the Kind people who prepare Individualized Education Program test reports for family review:

No further helpful information comes from high levels of decimal precision. The program recommendations will not change.

However, decimal precision does apply to parents’ feelings, and very, very low numbers exponentially increase the pain inflicted on parents who read that.

Just so you know.

I think it is better to avoid that in the future.

Based on what you read above, generating regret to guide your heart should be easy.”<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 8:08:48 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

### Paraphrased Narrative

To those who craft Individualized Education Program test reports for families, I offer a suggestion: spare the decimals. Precision at such extremes—fractions of a percentile—adds nothing useful. It won’t alter the recommendations or reshape the program’s goals.

But those tiny numbers cut deep. For parents, each decimal amplifies the sting, turning a simple report into a weapon of unintended cruelty. Numbers like that speak not of potential but of failure, etched with ruthless clarity. They linger in the mind, growing sharper with every glance.  

You may not intend harm, but harm arrives anyway. You hold more power than you realize. A simple shift—a choice to round, to soften—could spare parents from carrying wounds inflicted by cold calculations.

Consider this. You could let regret guide you, not as a punishment but as a compass. Let it shape your decisions. If you pause, even for a moment, to feel what these numbers might mean to someone else, I believe you’ll know what to do.

“Wherever you find darkness, the light is only one choice away.”<br>

<i>[11/26/2024, 8:10:14 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

### Paraphrased Narrative

Darkness presses in, suffocating and relentless, but it never stands alone. It exists as a shadow cast by the light, always near, always within reach. The hardest truth to grasp, the one we often ignore, is how close salvation waits—just one choice away.

I’ve walked in darkness, felt its weight smother my heart. In those moments, the light seemed distant, untouchable, like a memory half-forgotten. But the truth, stark and undeniable, whispered beneath the despair: I could turn toward it. The light didn’t vanish; I chose not to see it. The way out waited for me to act.

Every shadow hides its opposite. The question isn’t whether the light exists—it always does—but whether I had the courage to step toward it. That single choice, so simple yet so heavy, could shatter the grip of the darkness. The hardest battles begin with the smallest shifts.

I’ve learned this: no matter how deep the abyss, no matter how vast the shadows, the light never disappears. It only waits, patient and steadfast, for the moment you reach for it.

"I Hit the Lottery!

How likely is it to have a special child? Well, they measure that.

Mine is 1 in 10,000.

Talk about hitting the lottery!

Check out what I got in this deal!
Wow! I am Lucky!!!

My son never talks back to me with defiant anger.

Thankfully, he has speech, though content is limited.

It’s not content; it’s connection!

But he never angers me with willful disobedience or back-talk, so our household is peaceful.
Plus.

My son enjoys endless play and fun.

It’s like living with Peter Pan.

We play Mario Kart, Wii Golf, real Golf, we hike, walk the dog together, whatever I want, and whatever pleases him we do as a team.

We share the same interests and activities. He’s a playmate for life.

Who wouldn’t want that?
Plus. Plus.

My son can’t be spoiled.

He never becomes indulgent and entitled as a typical child would.

I can give him everything I have emotionally, and he just accepts it with gratitude and lives a happy life.

I can practice Giving, on steroids, and there are no negative consequences.
Plus. Plus. Plus.

My son loves me.

He loves me openly and entirely with no reservations, doubts, or fears of abandonment.

He feels his challenges and knows he needs help.

I see the gratitude in his eyes; I feel the gratitude in his heart.

I know the Pure Love of another Being.
Plus. Plus. Plus. Plus.

Wow! Four of them!

Who wouldn’t want a son like that?

And this isn’t merely “looking at the bright side.”

There is no dark side. He and his love are entirely pure."

### Paraphrased Narrative

I hit the lottery, but not the kind you dream about in passing. The odds? One in 10,000. That’s how rare it is to have a child like mine. Talk about luck!  

Let me show you what I mean. My son never raises his voice in defiance, never throws words like darts in anger. He speaks, though not in long conversations or complex ideas. But speech isn’t about volume or vocabulary—it’s about connection, and we have that in spades.  

Our home overflows with peace. There’s no shouting, no rebellion. And the joy? Endless. My son embraces play like Peter Pan, never growing tired of laughter or fun. We race in *Mario Kart*, swing clubs in Wii Golf or on real greens, hike through trails, walk the dog, or just share quiet moments together. Everything I love, he loves. We’re a team, bonded for life.  

He can’t be spoiled, no matter what I give. Entitlement doesn’t touch him, and he lives with open gratitude. Every gift I offer—my time, my care, my heart—he accepts with unshakable joy. I’ve learned what true giving feels like, without fear of overindulgence.  

And the love? Pure. My son loves me fully, without doubts or conditions. His gratitude shines in his eyes, radiates from his heart. He knows his struggles, knows he needs help, and he meets me with unwavering trust. Through him, I’ve known what pure, unselfish love feels like—love without shadows or hesitation.  

Four blessings. Four gifts. I’ve truly hit the jackpot. There’s no “bright side” here because there’s no dark side. His love, his life, his presence—they shine untarnished, as pure as anything I’ve ever known.

“My son is my Holy Spiritual Guide.

Every spiritual realization I have is from working with him.

I practice complete Exchanging Self with Other, abandoning my own will to fulfill his.

I don’t merely try to “put myself in his shoes;” that’s only part of the way.

I don’t imagine what he wants, weigh it against what I want, and try to compromise. That’s half-assed.

While consideration is essential for Kindness, a virtue, it falls short of the mark I set for this practice.

I ignore what I Want as useless information. (Difficulty 10) This never gets easier… well, maybe a little, but you never master it.

I give him 100% of my undivided attention for as long as possible. Completely undivided. (Difficulty 5) It’s just focused concentration, something you should always practice.

I determine what he wants, exercise my wisdom on appropriateness, and then practice Giving. (Difficulty: Currently 0, Previously 10). This area improves dramatically with practice. It’s also just good parenting.

This practice is both easy and challenging, exhausting and exhilarating if you do it moment by moment.

I don’t exchange once for a moment, watch a movie, and come back to see what’s happening. That’s not it.

It takes focused concentration until I permit him to practice Mario Kart or engage in some other activity by himself briefly while I recharge.

As a side benefit, he demonstrates the Qi value of Play, warming my heart.

I find the practice so rewarding, Qi inducing, that I find the times of recharge are fewer and shorter.

That happens with practice. Everything gets better.

I can’t spoil him, so I can practice whenever I want.

He likes it.”<br>

### Paraphrased Narrative

My son serves as my Holy Spiritual Guide, leading me to every realization I’ve gained. Through him, I’ve learned to exchange myself for another fully, setting aside my desires to meet his needs.  

This isn’t about imagining what he feels or stepping into his shoes for a moment. It isn’t compromise or balance. Compromise falls short. To truly exchange self for other, I ignore what *I* want entirely—useless information in this practice. It’s hard, relentlessly hard, a challenge that never fully softens. Maybe it gets a little easier with time, but mastery remains elusive.  

When I practice, I give him my complete, undivided attention. For as long as possible, I focus, no distractions. Concentration like this feels both natural and grueling, a skill honed through effort. I identify what he wants, apply wisdom to discern what’s appropriate, and then act with intent to give. At first, this felt impossible. Now, it’s second nature, a parenting principle as much as a spiritual exercise.  

The practice demands everything in the moment. I can’t give once, step away, and return after a break. It’s sustained attention, moment to moment, until I allow him to play *Mario Kart* or dive into his own activities while I pause to recharge. But even in those pauses, he teaches me. I see the Qi value of play, feel his joy warm my heart, and find myself needing less rest than before. With practice, even the draining parts become fulfilling.  

I’ve discovered a paradox in this—giving like this energizes more than it exhausts. The effort creates rewards that outweigh the cost. And the best part? He loves it. He thrives in it. With him, I can practice endlessly. He can’t be spoiled, and I can keep learning from his wisdom, moment by moment.

“The True Power of Narrative

Okay, we are going really, really deep here — Highest-level spiritual realization potential.

This is the crucial point of the entire work.

Pay careful attention.

If you can deeply internalize this one, you will understand the Buddhist concept of Śūnyatā, pertaining to the Emptiness of Meaning.

If you notice, in the two stories, dark and light, the only fact involved was the report that said 0.01.

Nothing else was presented as fact upon which to hang your feelings.

Every other emotion that sprang from that fact depends entirely upon how I interpret 0.01, 1 in 10,000.

That’s the incipient choice I described earlier.

Please go back and reread the openings if you didn’t notice.

It’s the key to understanding what comes next.

Deepen your understanding by reading those stories, imagining my son was a true savant, a genius with a 200 IQ.

Would that change your feelings?

The emotional starting point changes, but the destination is identical.”<br>

### Paraphrased Narrative

This is it—the deepest point, the heart of everything I’ve said. Pay attention here, because this holds the highest potential for spiritual realization. If you grasp this fully, you’ll touch the Buddhist concept of Śūnyatā—the Emptiness of Meaning.  

Look closely at the two stories I shared, one dark, one light. Strip them down to their bare bones. The only fact in either is the same: the report that said 0.01. That’s it. No other fact exists to anchor your feelings. Every emotion rising from that number depends entirely on my interpretation of it.  

That moment of interpretation, the incipient choice I spoke of earlier, defines everything. If you didn’t catch that, stop now. Go back. Reread the openings. That choice is the key to what follows.  

Now, shift the story. Imagine the same report, but instead of its current context, it describes a savant—a genius with a 200 IQ. Would your feelings change? Likely, yes. Yet the fact itself remains unchanged: 0.01. What shifts isn’t the fact but the narrative built around it.  

This is the true power of narrative. The starting point may shift, but the end remains the same. Meaning doesn’t exist inherently in facts. It only exists in how we choose to see them.

“How Love Transforms the World

Love is a Choice.

Why did the deepest, darkest night consume my soul?

I chose no.

I didn’t want an autistic child.

Why did feelings of elation arise, like I won the lottery?

I chose yes,

I wanted an autistic child.

I encountered the fact about my child: He is 1 in 10,000.

I had a choice to make about how to interpret that fact and weave it into the narrative of my life.

I could choose to reject my child and go to the Dark Side, assisted by victim-enabling groups confirming my life-sucks narrative.

I could choose to accept my child, completely and wholeheartedly, exactly as he is, not wanting him to be any different, and I go to the Light Side.

Neither interpretation is being forced upon me.

I have the power to choose.

And so do you.

Which would you choose?

Love empowers you to choose how you see the World.

Everything else follows.

That’s Power!

Choose a World of Love, and you Live in a World of Love.

Choose Love!!!

It’s Glorious!”<br>

### Paraphrased Narrative

Love transforms everything, but it begins as a choice.  

Why did the deepest, darkest night consume me? I chose no. I didn’t want an autistic child. Why did joy rise in me, as if I’d hit the lottery? I chose yes. I wanted an autistic child.  

The fact never changed: my son is 1 in 10,000. What changed was how I interpreted that fact, how I wove it into the story of my life. I stood at a crossroads. I could reject my child, letting the darkness take me, feeding on the life-sucks narrative offered by victim-enabling groups. Or I could embrace him—completely, unconditionally, as he is—without wishing him different, and step into the light.  

Neither path forced itself upon me. The power rested in my hands. I had to choose. And so do you.  

Love grants that power, the ability to shape how you see the world. From that choice, everything else follows. That’s real power. Choose to see the world through love, and you live in a world of love. Choose light, and the light surrounds you.  

It’s simple but profound. It’s glorious.  

Choose love.

“Fundamental Truth of the Mind

Every belief in your head begins as a seed planted in Body Reality.

Some information in the outside world enters your awareness.

Philosophers call these Brute Facts or, more simply, Data.

From there, you have complete control to interpret the meaning of that fact.

This is the key insight from Victor Frankl’s Man Search for Meaning.”<br>

### Paraphrased Narrative

Every belief in your mind begins as a seed, rooted in the reality of the body. Something from the outside world—an event, a fact—enters your awareness. Philosophers call these brute facts or, more plainly, data.  

What happens next defines everything. You take that fact and decide what it means. The interpretation doesn’t belong to the fact itself. That power rests with you.  

This is the fundamental truth of the mind: the meaning of a fact comes not from the world but from within. This insight, central to Viktor Frankl’s *Man’s Search for Meaning*, reveals the immense freedom we hold.  

No one forces meaning upon you. The world gives you facts, nothing more. What you make of them—how you let them shape your beliefs, your story, your life—belongs to you.

Do you feel drained, unsure if you have enough energy to give? Let me share some with you. Close your eyes and imagine the young man I described is your own. Picture the empty seat beside him—it belongs to you.  

Now, sit with your special person. Play the song *How Could Anyone*. Feel the music awaken your heart, the warmth spreading through you until your soul blazes like a quasar. Hold that feeling, keep it close, and let it transform you.  

That moment will change everything.

When I realized my son was different and autism was to blame (notice the victim feeling), I scoured the Internet looking for advice.

I didn’t realize I had a choice of interpretation from day one, so I followed my initial reaction — this sucks — accepted it as Truth, and sealed my fate.

If only I’d found a guide like this back then. It would have spared me so much heartache, helped me see the choices I didn’t realize I had.

 “Hell is Real

Scholars, philosophers, and theologians enjoy debating the existence of Hell.

Religious people promote the idea. They believe it has utility for controlling people’s bad behavior.

People hurt each other for selfish reasons because they believe they can get away with it.

Most religions and cultures invent a Hell as a catch-all insurance policy against getting-away-with-it while you were alive, hoping perhaps this will motivate a few people to “be good” to avoid eternal damnation.

As a concept, it’s become so burdened by legalese, endless, pointless debates on dogma, and philosophical mental masturbation that it no longer has enough emotional impact to scare people straight, assuming it ever did.

But you don’t need to be religious to see that Hell exists, right now, today.

Hell exists.  

Scholars, philosophers, and theologians argue endlessly about it. Religious leaders promote the idea, often using it as a tool to curb bad behavior. The notion assumes people harm others for selfish reasons because they think they’ll escape punishment.  

So, cultures and religions created Hell—a final reckoning for those who seem to get away with their sins in life. They hoped fear of eternal suffering might scare people into goodness.  

But over time, the idea of Hell lost its weight. Legalistic debates, dogmatic tangents, and empty philosophical posturing drained it of emotional power. Assuming it ever worked, it no longer frightens anyone enough to change their ways.  

You don’t need religion to see Hell, though. Hell exists here, now, today. You only need to open your eyes.

Of course, this doesn’t fit our religious sensibilities about hell; mostly, we see hapless victims being crushed under the jackboot of avarice, invisibly due to apathy and stone-cold indifference.

In many ways, that makes it worse. The evil that men do isn’t confined to those who deserve it.

Evil Lurks Inside Each of Us

When most people observe manifest evil in the world, they solace themselves with the delusion that says:

I would never do that.

It’s a comforting lie.

One that allows us to keep our self-image of a good person, Saintly even, for those with delusions of righteousness.

I’ve peered into the evil in my own heart.

I looked at my life circumstances and asked myself, “How bad could bad get?”

The answer is below.

Before you pat yourself on the back and think you are better than me, or that you are incapable of such terrible thoughts, please consider this:

YOU ARE LYING TO YOURSELF!

If you don’t face the evil in your own heart, you will never be a force for good in the world.

### Paraphrased Narrative

Wherever evil rises, Hell reveals itself for its victims. It rarely fits the tidy images of Hell we imagine from religious teachings. Instead, it manifests in the crushing of hapless lives under the boots of greed, veiled by apathy and frozen in cold indifference.  

In many ways, that makes it worse. The evil men do rarely targets the deserving—it consumes the innocent.  

Evil doesn’t dwell only in the actions of others. It lurks inside each of us.  

When we witness evil in the world, it’s easy to take refuge in the comforting lie: *I would never do that.* That delusion props up our self-image, letting us cling to the illusion of goodness or, for some, even saintliness.  

I’ve stared into the darkness within myself. I’ve asked hard questions, ones I struggled to answer. I looked at my life and asked, “How bad could I become?” The answers chilled me.  

Before congratulating yourself, before deciding you stand above this, consider one simple truth: that belief, that delusion, is a lie.  

Without confronting the evil in our own hearts, we cannot become a force for good. Ignorance of that truth only leaves the darkness unchecked, spreading into the world.

<i>[11/26/2024, 9:55:26 PM]</i> 👉 <b>🤖 Assistant</b>: 

"Squalid" describes something extremely dirty, unpleasant, or morally degraded. It often conveys a sense of neglect, decay, or filth, both in physical environments and metaphorical contexts.

Example:  
The room was squalid, with grime coating every surface and a stench that made breathing a challenge.  

Metaphorical use:  
The deal reeked of squalid corruption, hidden behind polished smiles and empty promises.<br>
