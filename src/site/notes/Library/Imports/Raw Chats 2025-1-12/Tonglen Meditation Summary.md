1. Tonglen, or Taking and Sending, is a Tibetan Buddhist practice of cultivating compassion by mentally taking on the suffering of others and sending them happiness and relief.
2. In Tonglen, practitioners breathe in the pain and negativity of others to transform it within themselves, then exhale positivity and healing back to the world.
3. This practice encourages a profound shift in perspective, fostering empathy and selflessness by reversing the usual logic of avoiding suffering and seeking pleasure.
4. Tonglen meditation involves visualizing the suffering of others as dark smoke absorbed into the heart, where it is purified and transformed into light, then radiated outward.
5. Through Tonglen, practitioners aim to develop Bodhicitta, the mind of enlightenment, characterized by unconditional compassion and the desire to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.<br>

1. Great Compassion in Lamrim is the profound desire to free all sentient beings from suffering, seeing their pain as one's own and striving for their ultimate happiness.
2. It serves as the foundation of the Mahayana path, motivating practitioners to attain enlightenment to effectively aid others in overcoming their sorrows and achieving spiritual liberation.
3. This level of compassion transcends mere empathy, embodying a deep, active commitment to alleviating the suffering of all beings without discrimination or limitation.
4. Great Compassion in Lamrim is cultivated through meditative practices, contemplation of interconnectedness, and the recognition of the pervasive nature of suffering in samsara.
5. It is considered the heart of Bodhisattva training in Lamrim, inspiring practitioners to undertake the path of selfless service and ultimate realization for the benefit of all sentient life.<br>
