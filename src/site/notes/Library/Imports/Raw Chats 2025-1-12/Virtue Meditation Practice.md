convert to third person "They call it object meditation, but you don’t focus your attention on things. The “object” of meditation is a virtue or, more specifically, the feelings that arise when you think about virtue.

In the meditations, you start with contemplation, which is basically thinking about something, and when the virtuous feeling arises, you hold onto those feelings for as long as possible, hours if you have the concentration for it.

If you lose the feeling, you return to the contemplation, generate the feeling again, and then hold it.

You become well-practiced at generating and holding virtuous feelings in your heart.

What is Virtue?

Western philosophers elaborate on what constitutes virtue and how we should live."<br>
