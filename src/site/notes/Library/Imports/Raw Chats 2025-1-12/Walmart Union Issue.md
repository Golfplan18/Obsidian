<i>[12/27/2023, 11:01:48 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: I'm here to help create images based on your descriptions. However, I don't generate images that could be seen as controversial, political, or sensitive in nature. Could you please provide a different image idea or theme for me to work on?<br>
<i>[12/27/2023, 11:08:14 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: a giant wearing a walmart uniform many times taller than the small people around him<br>
<i>[12/27/2023, 11:08:35 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>System</b>: 

DALLÂ·E displayed 2 images. The images are already plainly visible, so don't repeat the descriptions in detail. Do not list download links as they are available in the ChatGPT UI already. The user may download the images by clicking on them, but do not mention anything about downloading to the user.<br>

<i>[12/27/2023, 11:08:35 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: Here are the images based on your description. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like!<br>
