The Walton family, descendants of Walmart founder Sam Walton, remains the richest family in the United States with a combined net worth estimated at **$238.5 billion** as of March 2023. Their wealth primarily comes from their majority stake in Walmart, the world's largest retailer by revenue.

Here's a breakdown of the latest net worth estimates for some key members of the Walton family:

It's important to note that these are just estimates, and the exact net worth of each family member can fluctuate based on changes in the stock market and other factors. Additionally, the Walton family is quite large, with numerous descendants of Sam Walton, so there are many other members whose net worth is not publicly known.
