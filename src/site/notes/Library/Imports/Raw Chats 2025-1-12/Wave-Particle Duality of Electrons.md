<i>[12/31/2024, 7:19:48 PM]</i> <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: In this paper, the authors present the first full realization of Feynman's thought experiment. [cite: 241] By controlling the transmission through the individual slits of a double-slit, they were able to observe the diffraction patterns from slit 1, slit 2, and both, thus observing the wave properties of electrons. [cite: 265, 266, 267] Also, by recording single electron detection events diffracting through a double-slit they were able to build up a diffraction pattern, thus observing the particle properties of electrons.

This image series from your uploaded document shows the buildup of an electron diffraction pattern in a double-slit experiment.  

* **(a)** Shows the diffraction pattern when both slits are open. This is the classic interference pattern demonstrating the wave-like nature of electrons.
* **(b)** Shows the diffraction pattern with only slit 1 open.
* **(c)** Shows the diffraction pattern with only slit 2 open.
* **(d)** Illustrates the gradual accumulation of single electron detection events over time. Each dot represents an electron hitting the detector.
* **(e)** Shows the final result after many electrons have been detected. Notice how the pattern in (e) resembles the pattern in (a), even though the electrons were sent one at a time.

This experiment beautifully illustrates the wave-particle duality of electrons. They act as waves, creating an interference pattern, but they are also detected as individual particles, as seen in the gradual buildup of the pattern.

<i>[12/31/2024, 7:20:16 PM]</i> <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

This image series appears to show the controlled double-slit electron diffraction experiment described in the paper. It demonstrates how a movable mask can be used to control which slit the electrons pass through.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Left Column:** Schematic diagrams showing the position of the mask. 
    *  The dark gray areas represent the mask blocking the slits. 
    *  The orange represents the open slits allowing electrons to pass.
* **Right Column:** The resulting electron diffraction patterns observed on the detector.

The series shows the following scenarios:

* **Top Rows:** The mask progressively blocks more of slit 2 while increasingly opening slit 1. The diffraction pattern shifts accordingly, showcasing the influence of each slit on the final pattern.
* **Middle Rows:** Both slits are fully open. This produces the classic double-slit interference pattern with multiple fringes, demonstrating the wave-like nature of electrons.
* **Bottom Rows:** The process is reversed, with the mask progressively blocking slit 1 and opening slit 2. Again, the diffraction pattern shifts.

This experiment provides a compelling visualization of wave-particle duality and highlights the ability to manipulate quantum phenomena at a very fine level. By controlling which slit the electrons pass through, the researchers can directly influence the observed diffraction pattern, showcasing the interplay between wave-like interference and particle-like behavior.

<i>[12/31/2024, 7:20:27 PM]</i> <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

This figure illustrates the core concepts of the double-slit experiment and its relation to wave-particle duality.

* **(a) Experimental Setup:** Shows the classic double-slit arrangement with an electron gun, a wall with two slits (labeled 1 and 2), and a detector. The mask in this diagram is positioned to allow electrons to pass through both slits.
* **(b) Single-Slit Diffraction:**  
    * **Left:** Shows the probability distribution (P1 or P2) for electrons passing through a single slit. This creates a single broad peak.
    * **Right:** The actual diffraction pattern observed when only one slit is open.
    * **Equation:** Indicates that the observed pattern is the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitude (|Ïˆ|Â²), which represents the wave nature of the electron.
* **(c) Double-Slit Diffraction:**
    * **Left:** Shows the combined probability distribution (P12) when both slits are open. This results in an interference pattern with multiple peaks due to the superposition of the waves from each slit.
    * **Right:** The actual interference pattern observed on the detector when both slits are open.
    * **Equation:** Again emphasizes the connection between the observed pattern and the square of the absolute value of the sum of the probability amplitudes from both slits (|Ïˆ1 + Ïˆ2|Â²), highlighting the wave interference.

**Key Takeaways:**

* This figure demonstrates the wave-particle duality of electrons. They act as waves, creating an interference pattern when both slits are open, but they are also detected as individual particles at the detector.
* The probability distributions and equations illustrate the underlying quantum mechanics that govern this behavior.
* The experiment highlights how the act of observation or measurement (in this case, controlling which slits are open) can affect the outcome of a quantum event.
