These items seem to be related to alternative theories in physics, particularly those that involve the concept of "aether." Here's a breakdown:

**Aether Deceleration Theory (ADT)**

*   This theory, as the name suggests, likely proposes that aether, a hypothetical substance once thought to permeate all of space, is decelerating.
*   Historically, the concept of aether was used to explain the propagation of light and other electromagnetic waves. However, it was largely discarded in the early 20th century with the advent of Einstein's theory of relativity.
*   ADT might be an attempt to revive the aether concept, suggesting that it interacts with matter or energy in a way that causes it to slow down.
*   It's important to note that ADT is not part of mainstream physics and would likely face significant challenges in reconciling with established experimental results.

**Infinite Universe Theory (IUT)**

*   This theory posits that the universe is infinite in extent, both spatially and temporally.
*   It suggests that there is no edge to the universe and that it has always existed and will continue to exist forever.
*   IUT contrasts with the prevailing cosmological model, which proposes that the universe originated from a singularity (the Big Bang) and has been expanding ever since.
*   While the idea of an infinite universe is intriguing, it raises many questions about the nature of infinity and how it can be reconciled with our current understanding of physics.

**Vortex Aether Dynamics**

*   This concept likely combines the idea of aether with the concept of vortices, which are swirling patterns of motion.
*   It might propose that aether is not a uniform substance but rather consists of swirling vortices that interact with each other and with matter.
*   Such a theory could potentially offer explanations for various phenomena, such as gravity or electromagnetism, in terms of the dynamics of aether vortices.
*   Like ADT, Vortex Aether Dynamics is not a mainstream theory and would need to provide substantial evidence to gain acceptance in the scientific community.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to approach these theories with a critical and discerning eye. While they may offer interesting alternative perspectives, they generally lack the empirical support and rigorous mathematical framework of mainstream physics.
