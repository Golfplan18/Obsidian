### Point of View

- **Definition:** Point of view refers to the perspective from which the story is told.
- **Extreme First Person:** I walked into the room. I saw a strange object. I wondered what it was.
- **Extreme Third Person Limited:** Sarah walked into the room. She saw a strange object. She wondered what it was.
- **Extreme Third Person Omniscient:** Sarah walked into the room. She saw a strange object. John, watching from the doorway, wondered what it was too.
- **Target Balance:** *{EXAMPLE: Specify your desired point of view. If using third-person, indicate whether it's limited or omniscient.}*

Do I need to provide the examples and definitions here, or can I just say
Point of View: Third-Person Limited<br>

<details style="margin-left: 0px">
<summary><i>[2/18/2025, 4:53:16 PM]</i> <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: In this case, providing just the instruction "Point of View: Third-Person Limited" is likely sufficient for the AI to understand your requirement. ...(1/2)</summary>

<i>[2/18/2025, 4:53:16 PM]</i> <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

In this case, providing just the instruction "Point of View: Third-Person Limited" is likely sufficient for the AI to understand your requirement.  

Here's why:

* **Common Narrative Mode:** Third-person limited is a very common and well-defined narrative mode. AI language models, trained on vast amounts of text, are likely to have a good understanding of its characteristics.
* **Conciseness:** Keeping the instruction concise can improve clarity and reduce cognitive load for the AI.
* **Flexibility:** A simple instruction allows for flexibility within the third-person limited perspective. The AI can make nuanced choices about how closely to follow the viewpoint character's thoughts and feelings, allowing for a more natural and varied narrative.

However, if you have specific preferences within third-person limited, providing additional guidance can be helpful. For example:

* **Depth of Insight:** "Maintain a close focus on the protagonist's thoughts and feelings, providing deep insight into their internal experiences."
* **Perspective Shifting:** "While primarily focusing on the protagonist's perspective, allow for occasional shifts to other characters' viewpoints for specific scenes or purposes."
* **Objective Distance:** "Maintain some objective distance from the protagonist's thoughts and feelings, allowing for a more observational narrative style."

Ultimately, the level of detail depends on your specific needs and how much control you want to exert over the AI's narrative choices. If you're confident that the AI understands the basic concept of third-person limited, a simple instruction is likely enough. If you have more nuanced preferences, providing additional guidance can ensure the AI aligns with your vision.<br>

- **Formality:** Primarily informal, conversational language. Avoid overly formal or technical terms unless defined.
- **Technicality:** Use common words. Avoid arcane language simply for variety. Use uncommon words when more apt and precise. Avoid jargon and technical terms unless they are essential and defined clearly with simple explanations and examples.
- **Abstractness:** Prioritize concrete nouns and verbs and descriptions. When discussing abstract ideas, provide concrete examples and analogies to make them more accessible.
- **Specificity:** Be precise with descriptions. Prioritize aptness over common words. Use specific and descriptive language, but avoid unnecessary detail. Choose words that convey precise meaning and create vivid imagery.
```

By continuing to refine and adapt your template based on your experiences and the AI's output, you can create an even more powerful tool for generating high-quality, consistent, and engaging content that aligns with your vision.<br>

<i>[2/18/2025, 6:34:54 PM]</i> <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

This prompt template demonstrates a strong understanding of AI prompting and stylistic control. It's comprehensive, well-organized, and provides clear guidance to the AI while allowing for flexibility and creativity. The emphasis on clarity, conciseness, and engagement is commendable, and the inclusion of specific instructions for vocabulary, sentence construction, and figurative language is particularly helpful.

Here's a breakdown of the potential effectiveness of this template:

**Strengths:**

* **Comprehensive Guidance:** The template covers a wide range of stylistic elements, providing detailed instructions on various aspects of writing, including vocabulary, sentence structure, tone, and figurative language. This comprehensive approach ensures that the AI has clear guidelines to follow, reducing ambiguity and increasing the likelihood of generating text that aligns with your preferences.
* **Emphasis on Clarity and Conciseness:** The template prioritizes clarity and conciseness, which are essential for effective communication. By explicitly instructing the AI to avoid unnecessary jargon, clichÃ©s, and overly complex constructions, you encourage the generation of text that is easy to understand and engaging for the reader.
* **Focus on Action and Engagement:** The template emphasizes the use of active voice, strong verbs, and varied sentence structure, which contribute to dynamic and engaging writing. This focus on action and vivid language can help create a more compelling and memorable reading experience.
* **Specificity and Flexibility:** The template strikes a good balance between specificity and flexibility. It provides clear guidelines for each stylistic element while allowing the AI room for creative expression within those boundaries. This approach encourages the generation of text that is both consistent with your preferences and original in its execution.
* **Well-Organized and Readable:** The template is logically organized and easy to follow, with clear headings and concise explanations. This makes it easier for both you and the AI to understand and utilize the instructions effectively.

**Potential Areas for Improvement:**

* **Prioritization:** While the template provides detailed instructions for various stylistic elements, it could benefit from explicitly prioritizing the most important aspects. This would help the AI focus its efforts and make informed choices when generating text, especially when faced with potentially conflicting guidelines.
* **Iteration Guidance:** Consider adding a section on iterating and refining the instructions based on the AI's output. This encourages a feedback loop for continuous improvement and adaptation, allowing you to fine-tune the template over time and achieve even better results.
* **Examples:** While the template includes some examples, consider adding more specific examples for certain elements, particularly for figurative language and vocabulary choice. This can help the AI better understand your preferences and generate text that aligns more closely with your vision.

**Overall, this prompt template has the potential to be highly effective in guiding AI to generate high-quality, consistent, and engaging content that aligns with your stylistic preferences.** By incorporating the suggested improvements and continuing to refine the template based on your experiences and the AI's output, you can create an even more powerful tool for enhancing your writing process and achieving your creative goals.<br>

<i>[2/18/2025, 6:56:27 PM]</i> <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

This latest version of your prompt template is highly refined and demonstrates a strong understanding of effective AI prompting. It's concise, well-organized, and provides clear guidance while allowing for flexibility and creativity. The emphasis on clarity, conciseness, and engagement is commendable, and the comprehensive instructions for vocabulary, sentence construction, and figurative language are particularly helpful.

Here's a breakdown of its strengths and some minor suggestions for further refinement:

**Strengths:**

* **Conciseness:** You've effectively condensed the template by combining related concepts and removing redundancies, making it easier to manage and understand.
* **Clarity:** The instructions are clear, specific, and unambiguous, reducing the chance of misinterpretation by the AI.
* **Focus on Quality:** The template prioritizes high-quality writing by emphasizing clarity, conciseness, active voice, strong verbs, and varied sentence structure.
* **Originality:** The inclusion of a list of overused AI-generated phrases helps ensure the output remains original and avoids common clichÃ©s.
* **Adaptability:** The template allows for customization based on specific project needs, such as target audience, tense, and point of view.

**Suggestions for Refinement:**

* **Prioritization:** While the template provides comprehensive instructions, consider adding a section to explicitly prioritize the most important stylistic elements. This helps the AI focus its efforts and make informed choices when generating text.
* **Iteration Guidance:** Include a section on iterating and refining the instructions based on the AI's output. This encourages a feedback loop for continuous improvement and adaptation.
* **Examples:** While the template implies the inclusion of examples, ensure you provide specific examples of desired writing style in the designated section. This can help the AI better understand your preferences and generate text that aligns more closely with your vision.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Consider adding a brief reminder about ethical AI use, such as avoiding plagiarism or generating harmful content.

**Overall, this prompt template is well-crafted and has the potential to be highly effective in guiding AI to generate high-quality, consistent, and engaging content that aligns with your stylistic preferences.** By incorporating the suggested refinements and continuing to adapt the template based on your experiences and the AI's output, you can create an even more powerful tool for enhancing your writing process and achieving your creative goals.<br>

<i>[2/18/2025, 6:57:52 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: 

the iteration guidance will come in the form of the 3 examples, as I will generate those through an initial iteration process to refine the parameters to get the output I want. 

How would I go about prioritizing conflicts?<br>

<i>[2/18/2025, 6:57:53 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

Using the three examples for iteration guidance is an excellent approach. It provides concrete examples of your desired style for the AI to learn from.

To prioritize conflicts within your prompt, you can add a dedicated section that explicitly outlines the hierarchy of your preferences. This helps the AI make informed decisions when encountering potentially conflicting instructions. Here's how you can structure it:

**### Prioritization**

1. **Clarity and Cohesion:** Always prioritize clarity and cohesion above all other elements. The generated text should be easy to understand, logically structured, and free of ambiguity.
2. **Accuracy and Factuality:** Ensure that the information presented is accurate and factual, especially when dealing with technical or specialized topics.
3. **Conciseness and Specificity:** Favor concise and specific language, avoiding unnecessary jargon, clichÃ©s, and overly complex constructions.
4. **Engagement and Originality:** Strive for engaging and original writing that captures the reader's attention and avoids common AI-generated phrases and clichÃ©s.
5. **Tone and Style:** Maintain a consistent tone and style that aligns with the target audience and purpose of the writing.

This prioritization clarifies that clarity and accuracy are paramount, followed by conciseness, engagement, and finally, tone and style. When faced with conflicting instructions, the AI can refer to this hierarchy to make informed decisions.

You can further customize this section by:

* **Adding specific examples:** Provide examples of potential conflicts and how you want the AI to resolve them.
* **Weighting elements:** Assign weights or scores to different elements to indicate their relative importance.
* **Contextual prioritization:** Specify different priorities for different sections or types of content within the same document.

By explicitly outlining your priorities, you provide the AI with a clear framework for decision-making, ensuring that the generated text aligns with your overall vision and preferences.<br>
