Absolutely\! Here's a list of sites with public domain images, keeping in mind that "public domain" can sometimes have nuances, so always double-check the specific license for any image you intend to use:

**General Public Domain Image Sites:**

  * **Wikimedia Commons:** A massive repository of freely usable images, sounds, and videos. It's a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, the same organization that runs Wikipedia. [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main\_Page](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
  * **Public Domain Pictures:** Offers a wide variety of public domain images, with categories for easy browsing. [https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/)
  * **Old Book Illustrations:** A collection of public domain illustrations scanned from old books. Great for vintage and historical images. [http://www.oldbookillustrations.com/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=http://www.oldbookillustrations.com/)
  * **The Public Domain Review:** Curated collections of public domain images, often with a focus on historical and artistic works. [https://publicdomainreview.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://publicdomainreview.org/)
  * **New Old Stock:** A blog that indexes vintage photos that are in the public domain. [https://nos.twnsnd.co/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://nos.twnsnd.co/)
  * **PDPics:** Offers a collection of public domain images organized into categories. [http://www.pdpics.com/](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://www.pdpics.com/)

**Sites with a Mix of Public Domain and Freely Licensed Images:**

  * **Flickr:** While not everything is public domain, Flickr has a section called "The Commons" with images from institutions like the Library of Congress that are often public domain. [https://www.flickr.com/commons](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.flickr.com/commons)
  * **Library of Congress:** The Library of Congress has a vast collection of images, and many of them are in the public domain or have no known copyright restrictions. [https://www.loc.gov/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.loc.gov/)
  * **National Archives:** Similar to the Library of Congress, the National Archives has a huge collection of public domain images, especially related to U.S. history. [https://www.archives.gov/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.archives.gov/)
  * **National Gallery of Art:** The National Gallery of Art has an open access policy for images of works in their collection that are in the public domain. [https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images.html](https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images.html)

**Important Notes:**

  * **Copyright Laws:** Copyright laws can be complex and vary by country. It's always a good idea to double-check the copyright information for any image you plan to use, especially for commercial purposes.
  * **Attribution:** Even if an image is in the public domain, it's often considered good practice to give credit to the creator or source.

I hope this list is helpful\! Let me know if you have any other questions.
