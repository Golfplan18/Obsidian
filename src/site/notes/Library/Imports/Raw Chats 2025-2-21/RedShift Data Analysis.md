<i>[1/23/2025, 9:10:37 AM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: I want to assemble the data and ultimately create a chart. That's going to show. redshift by observation going back to the beginning of time 13.5 billion years. Baos baryonic oscillating radiation something these things have extreme redshifts and they go back to the CMB in the beginning of time I need those data points. and then the new observations that posit the existence of dark energy. the very distant light sources that show a more extreme redshift that are outside of the Hubble constant. And then I would like to have the actual observations. And you know, maybe some subsequent follow-ups. actual data points for nearby galaxies relatively nearby where the Hubble constant isn't. in so much trouble. By plotting all of these data points and connecting the red shifts. I want to have an equation. That can do this. And it's going to be related to gravity's inverse Square. It will be modified in some fashion to fit those data points. But it's going to be that kind of a decline in redshift. When you get away from the very edge of time.<br>
