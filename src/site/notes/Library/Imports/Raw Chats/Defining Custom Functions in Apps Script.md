<i>[1/3/2025, 2:23:43 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ‘¤ User</b>: If I use snap scripts from Google to create some python code that creates a custom function before I can implement it don't I have to Define that function and is that a separate step in a separate piece of code? Is it first I have to define the function bringing up something that defines it and then I can bring up and in bed that function into a Google sheet and use it.<br>

Yes, you need to define the function first in your Apps Script project. This involves writing the Python code that outlines what the function does. Once defined, you can then use the function within your Google Sheet.

**Here's a simplified breakdown:**

1. **Define the function:** In the Apps Script editor, write your Python code to define the function's logic.
2. **Save the script:** Save your Apps Script project.
3. **Use in Google Sheet:** In your sheet, call the function like you would any built-in function (e.g., =MY_CUSTOM_FUNCTION(A1)).

**Key Point:** The function definition needs to exist in the Apps Script code before it can be used in the sheet.

The function definition is embedded within your Apps Script project. It's not redefined every time you use it in your sheet. 

Think of it like this:

* **Apps Script:** Holds the function's code (like a recipe book).
* **Google Sheet:** Calls the function by name (like ordering a dish).

Both exist in the same Apps Script project, but they serve different purposes.

The first time you call the Apps Script function in your Google Sheet, it establishes a connection. The function's definition already exists within the script.

<i>[1/3/2025, 2:26:16 PM]</i> ðŸ‘‰ <b>ðŸ¤– Assistant</b>: 

Yes, exactly! The Apps Script contains both:

* **Definition:** This is where you name the function and specify what inputs (if any) it takes.
* **Instructions:** This is the code that describes what the function does with the inputs to produce an output.

It's all stored together within your Apps Script project.
