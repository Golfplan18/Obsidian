Engrams are organized through their interconnections rather than hierarchical folders. Folders serve only as basic file management tools.
# Folders Used
## Incubator
Engrams, Matrices, Drawings, every entry enters the system through the incubator. Here the entry is refined for library curation. 
### Imports
Outside sources of information that I generated is stored here for review and processing.
	**Are the engrams stored here permanently, or do they get moved into the library?**
This folder has subfolders for the main sources of information.
Import zones welcome wisdom from diverse sources. Each gateway serves specific tools: MindManager maps find their home. HTML content flows through dedicated channels. Apple Notes arrive in their special harbor. Chat transcripts gather in their own space. With many files flowing in, each source maintains its unique entry point. This organization preserves the clarity of our knowledge rivers.

## Library
The Library holds our refined knowledge gems. Each Engram matures here through thoughtful enhancement. Like living wisdom, these entries grow stronger through periodic renewal and deeper understanding.
### Engrams
Location for curated Engrams.
### Matrixes
The Navigation Hub directs our journey through knowledge landscapes. Rich content maps illuminate concentrated zones of insight. When Engrams cluster naturally around powerful themes, new maps emerge. These vital pathways form our wisdom transit system. Like a neural network of understanding, these maps transcend simple organization. Their profound interconnections create the living matrix of insight.
### Resources
Support files reside in their own dedicated space. This strategic separation keeps lightweight markdown content distinct from larger attachments. AI systems can scan ideas more efficiently. Quick backups become effortless.
### Supervision
Administrative procedures are kept in a dedicated space. This separation ensures quick access during system troubleshooting.
#### Templates
Templates rest within Administration's embrace. These specialized forms guide the birth of each new Engram. Their careful design nurtures the growth of fresh wisdom.
## Process
The Workspace nurtures evolving ideas. Every emerging Engram holds unique status markers. These status tags guide each piece through structured growth stages. A Kanban system illuminates their development path from seed to completion.
### Archive
The Archive safeguards completed or inactive Engrams. These records of past explorations or project-specific knowledge remain accessible for future reference. Though their active evolution pauses, their insights remain forever ready to illuminate future paths. Like ancient scrolls holding timeless knowledge, they await their moment to spark new understanding.
