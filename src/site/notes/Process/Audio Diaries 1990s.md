## Written or Audio Works
The current files are audio files I originally dictated into a tape recorder, often while driving.
It would be a candid look into the mind of a mid 20s male. 
	It may not be interesting.
	I always felt interesting, but there may be much more noise than signal.
	The perspective from 30s years on may be interesting.
	**I could create a science fiction story about sending messages to the past.**
		What message would I send myself?
		Would I tell him not to marry Michelle?
			If I did that, I would never have had James.
			Do we take the bad with the good?
			Do we accept what comes without judgement?
These have not been transcribed for text. 
	That would be the first step.
