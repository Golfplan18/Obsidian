## Problem Solving
### Anatta Phoenix?
Can the pen name Anatta Phoenix write about divorce, spiritual resonance, and autism acceptance?
	Saves on developing too many niche-specific names, particularly if I would not sustain writing in that niche.
	All three diverse writings are united by the themes of my life.

### What Books Can I Write?
#### Self Help on Autism Acceptance
Outline already done
A format I know
Won't be that impactful, but it's a start

#### Fiction Book
Will be much more impactful
Can incorporate really dark writing about autism in the struggle for acceptance
Will require learning and using Novelcrafter, perhaps a good learning project
