### Niche Analysis
I completed a cursory review of the works in the divorce section of Amazon.com. I don't see where any of my stories fit.
There is a small niche for stories written for men, but it's mostly women who are reading this stuff. 
The sincere apology title, which is in #4 above, is the only one that would appear to resonate there.
I need to revisit and perhaps edit these to appeal to women more, at least in the title and marketing frame.
A follow up work of fiction would be popular. Perhaps an opportunity to use Novelcrafter.

## Problem Solving
### What Books Can I Complete Based on My Existing Posts?
#### When Marriage Fails: A Journey Through Divorce and Self-Discovery
Based on my original posts with minimal editing to publish another title.
	Written for men as an advice
	Uses the text from the condensed writing
	Useful for a $0.99 giveaway
	I could also combine the original posts to get to 20,000 words, which would justify a $2.99 price point.

#### A Follow up Work of Fiction
Put my life and marriage into fiction.
Good project to learn to use NovelCrafter

### How Do I want to Incorporate Images into the Writing on Divorce?

### What Should I Call the Book?
I don't have a good working name.

### Forged in Divorce
#### Defining Lessons on Marriage, Mistakes, Masculinity, and Moving On

### Chivalry Reforged
##### Strength, Honor, and Recovery after Divorce
