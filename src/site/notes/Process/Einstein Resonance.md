# Einstein Resonance

The first two books are both vindications of Einsteins earlier intuitions. Both must be completed before this one is done.
[[Process/Expanding Awareness\|Expanding Awareness]]
[[Process/Quantum Mechanics\|Quantum Mechanics]]

I will incorporate both texts in their entirely once they are written with bridge sections explaining Einstein's original intuitions and how they didn't gain widespread acceptance during his life.
I would also add a section on the importance of intuition and a warning against mathematical mental masturbation.
