# Expanding Awareness Cosmology
All writings associated with the first work on the very large scale of the universe.
I believe [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble) and [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre) are wrong and the redshift they observed is not caused by the Doppler Effect.
