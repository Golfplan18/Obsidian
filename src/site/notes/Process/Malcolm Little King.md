## LinkedIn Bio Information
### About Malcolm Little King

I write under my given name, Malcolm Little King—not out of vanity, but out of inheritance.
My work centers on storytelling, policy, and the American myth. Raised in Georgia, educated at Georgia Tech, I’ve worn many titles—analyst, advisor, columnist, son.
Over the years, I’ve worked in the policy space and taught in community forums, including a brief fellowship at an innovation-focused nonprofit in the northeast (some of my early work drew on lessons I picked up from a Cooper Union project back in ’97—engineering minds think differently).
I spent time consulting for a youth engagement program modeled loosely on athletics mentorship—I’ve always believed there’s something sacred in the way a team breathes.
I’m influenced by the cadence of spoken word, the beats of public memory, and the rawness of performative culture. My earliest writing mentor also spent time in music—though we agreed, I should stick to words.
I’ve contributed to health equity projects with community-based research models—some of that thinking shaped my writing on indigenous justice and narrative ownership.
These days, I spend more time behind the scenes—ghostwriting, editing, and occasionally dropping thoughts into the void. I founded a small imprint to support work I believe in. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably already found it.
