# Old Cypress Publishing
I can reuse most of my old OC Housing News graphics without much change.
I can go a different direction and use some of the Old materials but emphasize the Lone Cypress photo I took and modified.
I can make a business card with two sides. One has my publisher information and the ochousingnews.com website I've had since 2011. Age has value in web addresses.
