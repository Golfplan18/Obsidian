# Political Writing
Outlet for my political outrage.
## Tasks
- [ ] Reboot [[Library/Engrams/Phukher Tarlson\|Phukher Tarlson]] with press releases from Diklis Chump, Perhaps some character profile stuff
- [ ] Boot up Malcolm Little King with posts from the books directed to Amazon.com
- [ ] Brainstorm the virtues and demerits of only having a Substack. Right now, I'm convinced a website is not needed for each pen name. I already own and have copies of my material, and the blogs are only useful for marketing, pointing people to the books on Amazon.com.

## Why Now?
[[Library/Engrams/Politics - Left Wing\|Politics - Left Wing]]
The political left has collapsed in the United States.
People need a voice to guide them from the wilderness.
The voice needs to be militant, unrepentant, mirroring the political right.
Malcolm X has a history and is a known commodity.
He's dead, and he can't sue me for impersonating him as a parody.
Mal-x.com is available. Mal-X is akin to Jay-Z catchy name.
Modern AI avatars can reanimate Malcolm X.

## Problem Solving
### Ideas for Political Expression
I need to gather ideas and writings together for books
Blogging is a great place for Engrams to assemble into books
Blogs require pen names and a commitment to keep writing, at least long enough to write the book.
