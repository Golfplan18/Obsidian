## Problem Solving
### Establish Publishing Name: [[Process/Old Cypress Publishing\|Old Cypress Publishing]]
I previously had the name Monterey Cypress LLC. The LLC was based on a tax structure, and it sounded both official and awful. I do have a nice logo.
I have a Bowker account for ISBNs. It owns the ISBN for The Great Housing Bubble. The first book in the empire.
**Monterey Cypress Publishing**
I can obtain the domain montereycypress.publishing
I will use the OC Housing News domain until then. I may wish to keep it due to its longevity.
**OCHN Publishing**
I could keep the domain, and it would make sense.
I could reuse much of the logo, coloration, graphics, business cards, and so on. 
I think I can merge the old LDR Corporation logos with the Lone Cypress with my old OCHN business cards. I could make the OC stand for Old Cypress Housing News.
#### [[Process/Old Cypress Publishing\|Old Cypress Publishing]]

### How to Set up the Microsoft Word File for Print Books and Kindle?
I must use Microsoft Word for the .docx extension. I may be able to use Google Docs and export.
I need a template to use on books by a specific pen name. Can be different for each.
The process for creating a Kindle book is to convert a properly formatted Microsoft Word document, so the document that serves as the print book also works as a Kindle Book

**This entire section is superseded by my work in Atticus**

### Where Should I Publish My Books?
Amazon.com is by far the largest distributor. I must self-upload KDP
Use the aggregator Draft2Digital until the 10% royalty becomes more than other alternatives.
