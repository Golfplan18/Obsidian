## Problem Solving

### What Real Estate Books Could I Write?
Without reviewing specifics of my inventory, I can brainstorm a few potential books.
	How Not to Manage Your Mortgage - HELOC abuse and house spenders
		Brief overview of home financing to provide background
		Greatly expanded section on HELOC abuse
		Add story about the lottery winner
		Push the word count over 20,000 words
		Use as many of the old cartoons as possible.
	California's Real Estate Ponzi Scheme - 
		Written for Red State consumption criticizing the liberals who got to enjoy free money while they worked hard.
		Take the basic outline of the book on how not to manage a mortgage.
		Modify it to explain what blue state people were doing.
		I can reuse the same stories.
		I can reuse many of the cartoons, particularly the extremely critical ones.
Initial Review of Inventory of Marketing writings
	Rent versus Own decision. 
		I have two drafts of 13,000 to 14,000 words.
		Could be expanded and updated easily.
	Financing 
		Related to the above.
		Needs updating with reference to specific requirements
		Focus on concepts rather than specifics.
		I have an 18,000 word draft
		I need to add some stories about HELOC abuse to push it over 20,000
	Foreclosures
		I have some California specific information on purchasing foreclosures at auction. 
		This will need work to be anything of interest or value
	For Sale By Owner guide
		15,000 words that are mostly garbage
		Could be turned into something useful with some research
	Home Buying Process
		22,000 words on buying a home
		Needs updating and more research
	OCHN Ultimate Guide to homebuying
		44,000 words that combined some of the above
		Some sections will need to be removed
		This needs work, but it provides a good outline
	Third-party real estate guides
		I have several brandable ebooks developed for realtor marketing
		These may be sources of supplemental information
	**Articles on real estate**
		I have about 250 short articles in a collection derived from TGHB
		It's 125,000 words
		There may be a few books here
		I can assemble these like atomic notes in different forms
		Keep the atomic note format and arrange them into collections.
		Doesn't require careful organization or an ongoing narrative.
		Can be easily supplemented with cartoons
		This would seem to be a fertile place to look
		Will require a paraphrase for each section and updated graphics
